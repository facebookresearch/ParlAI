Description\+: Question Answering in Context is a dataset for modeling, understanding, and participating in information seeking dialog. Data instances consist of an interactive dialog between two crowd workers\+: (1) a student who poses a sequence of freeform questions to learn as much as possible about a hidden Wikipedia text, and (2) a teacher who answers the questions by providing short excerpts (spans) from the text. Qu\+AC introduces challenges not found in existing machine comprehension datasets\+: its questions are often more open-\/ended, unanswerable, or only meaningful within the dialog context. link\+: \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07036}{\tt https\+://arxiv.\+org/abs/1808.\+07036}
