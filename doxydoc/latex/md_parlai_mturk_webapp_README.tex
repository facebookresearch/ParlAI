The webapp is very much still in beta, and a lot of it is subject to change, thus the readme isn\textquotesingle{}t going to be really fleshed out for a while. The code is fairly disorganized as the features come together.

To run the webapp, use {\ttfamily python \hyperlink{server_8py}{server.\+py}}. To run it for sandbox runs, use {\ttfamily python \hyperlink{server_8py}{server.\+py} -\/-\/sandbox}. Be sure you have node and npm installed.

Eventually this readme will have screenshots demonstrating the functionality, however in the meantime you can look at the various P\+Rs that have directly affected this directory, as each includes images and feature descriptions.
