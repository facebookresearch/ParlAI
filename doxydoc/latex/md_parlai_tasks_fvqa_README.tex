Description\+: The F\+V\+QA, a V\+QA dataset which requires, and supports, much deeper reasoning. We extend a conventional visual question answering dataset, which contains image-\/question-\/answer triplets, through additional image-\/question-\/answer-\/supporting fact tuples. The supporting fact is represented as a structural triplet, such as $<$Cat,Capable\+Of,Climbing\+Trees$>$.
