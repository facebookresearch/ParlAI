Our continuous integration suite will run only fast tests before merging. We also have a number of slow, more thorough tests which run nightly. You can additionally run these by adding {\ttfamily \mbox{[}long\mbox{]}} into any of your commit messages. (A full list of test triggers may be found in {\ttfamily .circleci/triggers.\+py})
