First install the theme we use\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
pip install -r requirements.txt
\end{DoxyCode}


Then use make to build the html\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
make html
\end{DoxyCode}


Then, make any changes to the documentation in {\ttfamily source}, do {\ttfamily make html} again, and check your changes by checking the html files in {\ttfamily build/html} (you can start by opening {\ttfamily index.\+html}). If everything looks good, make a Pull Request and the documentation will update automatically once the change has landed. If the documentation is not up to date within an hour after landing, please file an issue.
