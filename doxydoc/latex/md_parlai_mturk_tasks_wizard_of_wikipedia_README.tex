The task involves two people holding a conversation. One dialog partner chooses a topic to discuss, and then dialog proceeds.

One partner is the Wizard, who has access to retrieved external information conditioned on the last two utterances, as well as information regarding the chosen topic.

The other partner is the Apprentice, who assumes the role of someone eager to learn about the chosen topic.
