This directory contains three separate tasks related to the collection of the Persona-\/\+Chat dataset featured in \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07243.pdf}{\tt this} paper.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries personachat\+\_\+collect\+\_\+personas} is the task of collecting character descriptions.
\item {\bfseries personachat\+\_\+chat} assumes we already have character descriptions. It randomly assigns two Mechanical Turk workers characters, and asks them to chat to each other using that character.
\item {\bfseries personachat\+\_\+rephrase} is the task of collecting revised versions of a set of character descriptions. It gives a worker a character and asks them to rephrase it one sentence at a time.
