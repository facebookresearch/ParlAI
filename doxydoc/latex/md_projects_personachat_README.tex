This directory contains example training and interactive scripts for some of the models used in the paper \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07243.pdf}{\tt Personalizing Dialogue Agents\+: I have a dog, do you have pets too?}. If you are interested in the Mechanical Turk tasks used to collect the Persona-\/\+Chat dataset used in this paper, you can view them \href{https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/master/parlai/mturk/tasks/personachat}{\tt here}.

Note that the dataset for the Conv\+A\+I2 competition is larger than the Persona-\/\+Chat dataset, so we are computing new baselines for that competition. See the baselines for that competition \href{https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/master/projects/convai2}{\tt here}. Also note that the Profile Memory model has been deprecated and removed from this codebase; for generative models trained on the Conv\+A\+I2 dataset you can see that project folder.

\subsection*{Examples}

Look at the Persona\+Chat data\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
python examples/display\_data.py --task personachat --datatype train
\end{DoxyCode}


Interact with a pre-\/trained Key-\/\+Value Memory Net model trained on Persona-\/\+Chat using persona \textquotesingle{}self\textquotesingle{}\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
python projects/personachat/scripts/kvmemnn\_interactive.py
\end{DoxyCode}
