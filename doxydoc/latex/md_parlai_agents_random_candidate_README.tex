This is an agent which chooses a random label candidate, to be used for debugging or as an extremely simple baseline.

If label candidates are available for the task, it chooses one randomly as a response. It randomly sorts the candidates to return in the {\ttfamily text\+\_\+candidates} field, used for calculating hits metrics. If label candidates are not available, it just repeats the label.

\subsection*{Basic Examples}

Evaluate on b\+Abi by choosing a random candidate. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
python examples/eval\_model.py -m random\_candidate -t babi
\end{DoxyCode}
