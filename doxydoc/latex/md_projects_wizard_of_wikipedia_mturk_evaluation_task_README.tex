This is the Mechanical Turk task for evaluating models trained on the Wizard of Wikipedia task.

As an example, we have one of the pre-\/trained models loaded inside the task. Please edit {\ttfamily config} in {\ttfamily run.\+py} to swap out the model for one of yours.

In order to run the task with two humans speaking to each other, run with the flag {\ttfamily -\/-\/human-\/eval True}.
