Got 4 utterances with gold annotations. Found 8 utterances matching gold annotations from DataFrame.
Average agreement with 4 total gold utterances annotated was:
bucket_0: 91.7% (0 gold problem samples)
bucket_1: 100.0% (1 gold problem samples)
bucket_2: 75.0% (0 gold problem samples)
bucket_3: 91.7% (0 gold problem samples)
bucket_4: 100.0% (2 gold problem samples)
none_all_good: 58.3% (1 gold problem samples)
Average agreement problem samples only with 4 total gold utterances annotated was:
bucket_0: nan% (0 gold problem samples)
bucket_1: 100.0% (1 gold problem samples)
bucket_2: nan% (0 gold problem samples)
bucket_3: nan% (0 gold problem samples)
bucket_4: 100.0% (2 gold problem samples)
none_all_good: 33.3% (1 gold problem samples)
Calculating agreement on 8 annotations.
