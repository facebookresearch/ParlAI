# Contributing to ParlAI

While we are seeding this project with an initial set of popular tasks and a few
models and examples, ongoing contributions from the research community are
desired to increase the pool of tasks, models, and baselines.

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`. Set up your environment
   and run `pre-commit install` once.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Black your code (`black`), and make sure your code lints (`bash tests/lint_changed.sh`).
5. Ensure the test suite passes. Run `python setup.py test`.
6. If you've added a new dataset, you should also run
   `python setup.py test -s tests.suites.datatests`. Copy-paste the output into a
   comment in your PR.
7. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

Our continuous integration suite will run only fast tests before merging. We also
have a number of slow, more thorough tests which run nightly. You can additionally
run these by adding `[long]` into any of your commit messages. (A full list of
test triggers may be found in `.circleci/triggers.py`)
