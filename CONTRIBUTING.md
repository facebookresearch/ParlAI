# Contributing to ParlAI

While we are seeding this project with an initial set of popular tasks and a few
models and examples, ongoing contributions from the research community are
desired to increase the pool of tasks, models, and baselines.

## Pull Requests

4. Ensure the test suite passes (you can skip test\_data.py but should include a
