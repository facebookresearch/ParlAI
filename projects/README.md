# ParlAI Projects

Here we list projects undertaken in the ParlAI framework that are shared publicly, either in the form of papers, public tasks (with leaderboards) and/or shared model code.

This directory also contains subfolders for some of the projects which are housed in the ParlAI repo, others are maintained via external websites. Please also refer to ParlAI's [agents](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/master/parlai/tasks), [tasks](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/master/parlai/agents) and [model zoo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/master/parlai/zoo) for what else is in ParlAI.
