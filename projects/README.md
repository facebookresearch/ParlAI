# ParlAI Projects

Here we list projects undertaken in the ParlAI framework that are shared publicly, either in the form of papers, public tasks (with leaderboards) and shared model code.

This directory contains subfolders for some of the projects which are housed in the ParlAI repo, others are maintained via external websites.
