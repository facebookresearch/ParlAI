This is the Mechanical Turk task for evaluating models trained on the Wizard of Wikipedia task.

As an example, we have one of the pre-trained models loaded inside the task. Please edit `config` in `run.py` to swap out the model for one of yours.

In order to run the task with two humans speaking to each other, run with the flag `--human-eval True`.
