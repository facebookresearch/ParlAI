### Learning in Interactive Games with Humans and Text
<p align="center"><img width="90%" src="tavern.png" /></p>
The LIGHT project is a large-scale fantasy text adventure game research platform for training agents
that can both talk and act, interacting either with other models or with humans. 

## Abstract

We introduce a large-scale crowdsourced text adventure  game  as  a  research  platform for studying grounded dialogue.  In it, agents can both perceive,  emote and act whilst conducting
dialogue  with  other  agents;  models  and humans can both act as characters within the game. We describe the results of 
training state-of-the-art  generative  and  retrieval  models  in this setting. 
We show that in addition to using past dialogue, these models are able to effectively  use  the  state given  by  the
underlying world. In particular, we show that ground-ing on the details of the local environment,
including location descriptions  and  the  objects (and affordances of those objects) and characters
(and their previous actions) present within it allows better predictions of agent behavior and dialogue. 
We analyze the ingredients necessary for successful grounding in this setting, and how each of these factors
relate to agents that can talk and act successfully.

A detailed description may be found in [Urbanek et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03094).

## Datasets

LIGHT currently features 663 locations, 3462 objects and 1755 character types,
described entirely in natural language. Within that game world, we collect 11,000 episodes of 
character interactions (talking and acting).

You can view the data or train your own ParlAI agent on the LIGHT tasks with
`-t light_dialog`. See the [ParlAI quickstart for help](http://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_quick.html).

## Pretrained Models

The BERT Bi-Ranker dialogue model is available e.g. via this command (which automatically downloads it):

    python examples/eval_model.py -t light_dialog -mf models:light/biranker_dialogue/model
