### Learning in Interactive Games with Humans and Text

The LIGHT project is a large scale fantasy text adventure game platform for training agents
that can both talk and act. 

## Abstract

We introduce a large scale crowdsourced text adventure  game  as  a  research  platform for studying grounded dialogue.  In it, agents can both perceive,  emote and act whilst conducting
dialogue  with  other  agents;  models  and humans can both act as characters within the game. We describe the results of 
training state-of-the-art  generative  and  retrieval  models  in this setting. 
We show that in addition to using past dialogue, these models are able to effectively  use  the  state given  by  the
underlying world. In particular, we show that ground-ing on the details of the local environment,
including location descriptions  and  the  objects (and affordances of those objects) and characters
(and their previous actions) present within it allows better predictions of agent behavior and dialogue. 
We analyze the ingredients necessary for successful grounding in this setting, and how each of these factors
relate to agents that can talk and act successfully.
