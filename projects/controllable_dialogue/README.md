## Abstract

A good conversation requires balance -- between simplicity and detail; staying
on topic and changing it; asking questions and answering them. Although
dialogue agents are commonly evaluated via human judgments of overall quality,
the relationship between quality and these individual factors is less
well-studied. In this work, we examine two controllable neural text generation
methods, conditional training and weighted decoding, in order to control four
important attributes for chitchat dialogue: repetition, specificity,
response-relatedness and question-asking. We conduct a large-scale human
evaluation to measure the effect of these control parameters on multi-turn
interactive conversations on the PersonaChat task. We provide a detailed
analysis of their relationship to high-level aspects of conversation, and show
that by controlling combinations of these variables our models obtain clear
improvements in human quality judgments.
