The core library contains the following files:

- **agents.py**: this file contains a few basic agents which can be extended by your own model
  - **_Agent_**: base class for all other agents, implements the act() method which receives an observation table and returns a table in response
  - **_Teacher_**: child of Agent, also implements the report method for returning metrics. Tasks implement the Teacher class
  - **_MultiTaskTeacher_**: creates a set of teachers based on a "task string" passed to the Teacher, creating multiple teachers within it and alternating between them
  - create_task_teacher: instantiate a teacher from a given task string (e.g. 'babi:task:1' or 'squad')
- **build_data.py**: basic utilities for setting up data for tasks. you can override if your filesystem needs different functionality.
- **dict.py**: contains code for building general NLP-style dictionaries from observations
  - DictionaryAgent: agent which tracks the index and frequency of words in a dictionary, and can parse a sentence into indices into its dictionary or back
- **metrics.py**: computes evaluation metrics, e.g. ranking metrics, etc.
- **params.py**: uses argparse to interpret command line arguments for ParlAI
- **teachers.py**: contains teachers that deal with dialogue-based tasks, as well as data classes for storing data
  - **_FixedDialogTeacher_**: base class for a teacher that utilizes fixed data
  - **_DialogTeacher_**: base class for a teacher doing dialogue with fixed chat logs
  - **_ParlAIDialogTeacher_**: a teacher that implements a simple standard text format for many tasks (non-visual tasks only)
- **thread_utils.py**: utility classes/functions for use in Hogwild multithreading (multiprocessing)
  - SharedTable: provides a lock-protected, shared-memory, dictionary-like interface for keeping track of metrics
- **worlds.py**: contains a set of basic worlds for tasks to take place inside
  - **_World_**: base class for all other worlds, implements `parley`, `shutdown`, `__enter__`, and `__exit__`
  - **_DialogPartnerWorld_**: default world for turn-based two-agent communication
  - **_MultiAgentDialogWorld_**: round-robin turn-based agent communication for two or more agents
  - **_HogwildWorld_**: default world for setting up a separate world for every thread when using multiple threads (processes)
