"""
Main launch script for single-host, multi-GPU training.

This is a drop-in replacement for train_model.py.  This script will launch N
subprocess, each which runs the full training loop independently.

Uses torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel for its main uses.  Agents must
specifically implement the wrapper of DistributedDatParallel, but all
TorchRankerAgents and TorchGeneratorAgents support this.
