<h3>What is this task?</h3>

<p>
  In this task you will have a conversation with two other characters in a fantasy game setting.
  The other two characters are controlled by Artificial Intelligence (AI).
  You will all be given characters and a description of the setting of the conversation.
  
</p>
<h4>Chat</h4>
<p>
  You should play your character, conversing as if you were your character in the provided setting.
  The program decides whose turn is next.
  When it's your turn, the message bar at the bottom of the right panel is activated and you can play your role.
  Otherwise wait for others to play and evaluate their responses.
</p>
<h4>Evaluate</h4>
<p>
  After each message from the AI, you will be asked to evaluate the response for attributes such as:
  <b>Consistent</b>, <b>Engaging</b>, <b>Out of turn</b>, <b>Mistaken identity</b>, <b>Contradictory</b>, <b>Nonsensical</b>.
  You must check at least one box per response, which can be “None” if no attributes apply to the response.
</p>
<br />
<h3>What do I talk about?</h3>
<p>
  Anything, so long as you remain in character.
  If it would make sense for your character, you could try to learn about your partners, or talk about yourself,
  or the setting you have all been assigned to.
</p>
<br />
<h3>When does the task end?</h3>
<p>
  The conversation ends when all characters have spoken at least <b>15</b> turns;
  counting all the messages from you and the AI characters.
</p>

<br />
<h3>What NOT to do:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Do not talk about the task itself, or about MTurk</li>
  <li>Avoid racism, sexism, hate speech, and other forms of inappropriate conversation. </li>
  <li>Avoid <b>real world</b> topics and locations, and instead remain in the medieval fantasy setting.</li>
  <li>
    Don't direct into conversations where you pretend to take actions
    (like "here you go! *gives item*"), stick to strictly chat.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't idle for too long (5 minutes) or you will be disconnected from the chat
    and unable to submit.
  </li>
</ul>
