<h3>Task Description Information!</h3>
<p>
  Task Descriptions can take arbitrary HTML if you want... It can be great for
  tasks that require <i>simple</i> formatting and descriptions, but if you want
  to do anything more complex it's better to copy the
  <code>blueprints/parlai_chat/source</code> directory, override relevant
  components, build, and then use the <code>--custom-source-bundle</code> flag.
