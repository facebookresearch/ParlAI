<h3>Task Description Information!</h3>
<p>
  Task descriptions can take arbitrary HTML. This can be great for tasks that require <i>simple</i> formatting and descriptions, but if you want to do anything more complex, it's better to copy the <code>mephisto/abstractions/blueprints/parlai_chat/</code> directory in the Mephisto repo, override relevant components, build, and then use the <code>mephisto.blueprint.custom_source_bundle</code> flag.
