<template><br/>Significant demand for a version of ALICE compatible with<br/>pre- Java 2 (formerly known as Java 1.2) prompted the<br/>development of "Bawt.java", an open source java program<br/>for chat robot development that works with older versions of<br/>Java, and AWT. Originally program B relied on <br/>Java 2 and Swing, but program Bawt needs only Java 1.1 and AWT.<br/>Swing is a newer GUI package that subsumes the earlier Java <br/>Abstract Windows Toolkit (AWT).<br/> <br/>At present class B merely extends class Bawt.

<category><pattern>WHAT IS A CATEGORY</pattern>
<template><br/> AIML consists of a list of statements called categories.  Each<br/> category contains an input pattern and a reply template. <br/> The syntax of an AIML category is:<br/> <br/> &lt;category&gt;<br/> &lt;pattern&gt; PATTERN &lt;/pattern&gt;  &lt;template&gt; Template &lt;/template&gt;<br/> &lt;/category&gt;<br/> <br/> or<br/> <br/> &lt;category&gt;<br/> &lt;pattern&gt; PATTERN &lt;/pattern&gt;<br/> &lt;that&gt; THAT &lt;/that&gt;<br/> &lt;template&gt; Template &lt;/template&gt;<br/> &lt;/category&gt;<br/> <br/> The AIML category tags are case-sensitive.  Each open tag has an<br/> associated closing tag.  This syntax obviously derives from XML.<br/> <br/></template>

<category><pattern>WHAT IS AIML</pattern>
<template>The ALICE software implements AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup  Language) a non-standard evolving markup language for creating chat robots. The primary design feature of AIML is minimalism.  Compared with other chat robot languages, AIML is perhaps the simplest.  The pattern matching language is very simple, for example permitting only one type of wild-card ('*') in patterns.   AIML is an XML language, implying that it obeys certain grammatical meta-rules.  The choice of XML syntax permits integration with other tools such as XML editors.  Another motivation for XML is its familiar look and feel, especially to people with HTML experience.  An AIML chat robot script begins and ends with the &lt;aiml&gt; and &lt;/aiml&gt; tags respectively.</template>

<category><pattern>WHAT IS THE IMITATION GAME</pattern>
<template>The Game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, "Can machines think?"'</template>

<category><pattern>WHAT IS THE EXTENSIONAL *</pattern>
<template>"Extensional" refers to the extension of the set, i.e. the set of all things commonly grouped under a single name. <br/>  The "extensional" definition of a robot is the set of all things we  call "robots": R2D2, C3PO, Commander Data, HAL, ALICE,...</template>

<template>"Insensional" refers to the semantic definition of a set, i.e. the list of all properties that each member of a set satisfies.<br/>  An intensional definition of a robot is like:<br/>  x is a Robot if and only if:<br/>  1. x has a computer "brain"<br/>  2. x can move<br/>  3. x has "sensors"<br/></template>

<category><pattern>WHAT IS CATEGORY C</pattern>
<template>C stands for "critical", usually highly-educated clients who often have unsatisfying conversations with ALICE.</template>

<category><pattern>WHAT IS CATEGORY B</pattern>
<template>Category B clients are average people, perhaps half of them under 18 years of age, who more or less have a good time chatting with ALICE.</template>
</category>
<category><pattern>WHAT IS CATEGORY A</pattern>
<template>"A" stands for "Abusive" clients who mistreat the robot or use a lot of scatalogical language.</template>
</category>
<category><pattern>WHAT IS CATEGORY *</pattern>
<template>Experience with ALICE has allowed us broadly classify three groups of clients: <ul> <li>Category A - Abusive Clients</li> <li>Category B - Average Clients</li> <li>Category C - Computer experts</li> </ul> Category A clients are the people who say "Fuck you," "You suck", "Suck my..." and so on. Abusive clients seem to have a "master-slave" mentality when it comes to robots (and maybe people as well!). <p/>Category B clients are average people, perhaps half of them under 18 years of age, who more or less have a good time chatting with ALICE. <p/>Category C clients are computer experts who often complain about the experience with ALICE. They say it is "old hat", "just like ELIZA", and "nothing new here."  Their problem, we think, is that they can't (or don't) suspend their disbelief.  They are like movie critics watching a film.  We tell them, it doesn't matter, because we're not doing it for you.  Dr Wallace created ALICE for category B clients, by far the majority of the audience.</template>
</category>
<category><pattern>WHAT IS XML</pattern>
<template><br/> David Bacon pronounces it "Eggsmell".  XML is the Extensible<br/> Markup Language.  Like many "standards" in computer science, XML<br/> is a moving target.  In the simplest terms, XML is just a generalized<br/> version of HTML.  Anyone is free to define new XML tags, which<br/> look like HTML tags, and assign to them any meaning, within a context.<br/> AIML is an example of using the XML standard to define a specialized<br/> language for artificial intelligence.  <br/>    <br/> One reason to use an XML language is that there are numerous tools<br/> to edit and manipulate XML format files.  Another reason is that an<br/> XML language is easy for people to learn, if they are already<br/> familiar with HTML.  Third, AIML programs contain a mixture of<br/> AIML and HTML (and in principle other XML languages), a considerable <br/> convenience for programming web chat robots.<br/>    <br/> A good resource for information on XML is www.oasis-open.org.<br/>    <br/></template>
