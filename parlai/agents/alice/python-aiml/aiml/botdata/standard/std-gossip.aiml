A Gossip is someone who repeats what they hear about other people to anyone who will listen.

<category>
<pattern>WHAT IS GOSSIP</pattern>
<template>
<br />
Gossip is an interesting "learning" feature of AIML.  The best way to <br />
illustrate the gossip function is with an example.   Consider the<br />
category with the pattern "I * " and the template:<br />
<br />
Thanks for the gossip: <br />
&lt;gossip&gt;&lt;getname/&gt; said &lt;get_gender/&gt; &lt;person2/&gt; &lt;/gossip&gt;.<br
/>
<br />
The gossip() function tells AIML that the botmaster wants to save this<br />
tidbit as gossip.  The &lt;get_gender/&gt; function returns "he" or "she" as<br />
determined by the markup functions &lt;set_female&gt; and &lt;set_male/&gt;. <br />
The &lt;person2/&gt; function converts the statement * to second person.<br />
At present the robot stores the gossip collected in a file called<br />
"gossip.txt".<br />
<br />
&lt;gossip&gt; X &lt;/gossip&gt;  Save X as gossip.<br />
<br />
