<pattern>WHAT DO BEARDED DRAGONS LOOK LIKE</pattern>
<template>
Bearded Dragons have spikes similar to a horney toad,
   and they are usually brown or yellowish with dark brown
   or possibly reddish markings.  Kind of cool looking in a
   rugged sort of way. They are very nice, and make fun pets.

<pattern>WHAT DO CHAMELEONS LOOK LIKE</pattern>
<template>
Chameleons are some of the most exotic and strange looking
   lizards anywhere.  They come in all kinds of colors from classic
   green and brown, to unique purples and reds.  They have two toed
   feet that help them climb anything they can grip. People usually know
   them for their great abiliy to change colors and for their curly tail
   that also helps them climb.

<li> A nutritious diet is important for lizards.</li>
<li> Salads are an important part of most lizards' diets.</li>
<li> Sometimes I let my bearded dragon chase crickets in her room. It makes feeding time fun.</li>
<li> Do you have any questions about feeding lizards?</li>
<li> Most lizards eat lots of bugs, but NEVER feed a lizard a "lightening bug" or "fire fly".. they are highly toxic and
will kill the lizard.</li>
