# Seq2Seq Agent

The Seq2Seq agent takes an input sequence and produces an output sequence.

The agent supports encoding and decoding via a variety of RNN flavors, including LSTMs and GRUs. The agent supports encoding and decoding via a variety of RNN flavors, including LSTMs and GRUs. Decoding can be done via greedy.
