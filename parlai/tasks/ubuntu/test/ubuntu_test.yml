    - thx . unfortunately the program isn't installed from the repositories .
    - how can I check? By doing a recovery for testing? .
    - nice thanks! .

      others call them flavors, same difference) .
    - wrong channel for it, but check efnet.org, unofficial page. .
    - every time the kernel changes, you will lose video . yep .

    - ah yes, i have read return as rerun .
    - not the case, LTS is every other .04 release. The .04 isn't always more stable
      . I would reinstall with Precise . you can restore user data and such from backup
      .
    - cdrom worked fine on windows. . i dont think it has anything to do with the
      buring process, cds work fine on my desktop and my other ubuntu lap .
    - hm? .
    - ok .
    - ffmpeg is part of the package , quixotedon , at least I'm quite sure it still
      is . if not just install ffmpeg .
    - I used the one I downloaded from AMD .
    - 'nmap is nice, but it wasn''t what I was looking for.  I finally found it again:
      mtr (my traceroute) is what I was looking for.  I''ll be keeping nmap handy
      though. .'
    - Pretty much .

    - just wondering how it runs .

    - if you're only going to run Ubuntu, just get a normal PC rather than a mac .
      that said, I'm running it on a macbook, because I got one relatively cheaply
      .
    - why do u need analyzer . it is a toy . ok msp301 . but y, i mean it is the same
      ubunut, only with older programs . ubuntu 804 or 1204 . no i dont use 804 .
      i am asking hypo qs .
    - yes, that's what I did, exported it to a "id_dsa" file, then back to Ubuntu
      copied it into ~/.ssh/ .
    - that should fix the fonts being too large .
    - I get to the menu with options such as 'try ubuntu', 'install ubuntu', 'check
      disc' .
    - just wondering how it runs .
    - nothing - i am talking about the question of myhero .
    - Cntrl-C may stop the command but it doesn't fix my HDD problem. .
    - okay, so hcitool echos back hci0 <mac address of controller> but the bluetooth
      devices panel keeps disconnecting and reconnecting the device (or so it seems)
      any idea why that would be? .
    - the ones which are not picked up at the moment are on STDERR and not STDOUT
      and > is only covering STDOUT .

    - you should read error messages, it says 'are you root?' .
    - waiting the college semester to close just to make sure I will not need to reconfigure
      my environment again .
    - by the way, the url you posted for davfs is from dapper... that's 5.xx iirc
      .
    - i'd say the most commonly venue would be via Launchpad. check out the factoid
      !bug as well .
    - i'll give a try .

    - I was calling myself a jerk. All I know is that you downloaded a game successfully.
      .
    - So I load up putty gui, then what do I do? .
    - the old hardy man page, http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man1/gcalctool.1.html
      says "delete" clears the screen, but it doesn't . because LTS are good .
