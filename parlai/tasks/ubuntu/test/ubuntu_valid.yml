    - you are still asking for the unity logout menu right? .
    - 'lsb_release -sc . well... regardless. I believe the solution is going to be
      to live boot to cd, chroot into the machine and set a password. . Boot to live
      cd. Open a terminal and type sudo -s. mount /dev/sdXY /mnt      where X is the
      disk and Y is the partition. Typically /dev/sda1.  then chroot /mnt. To create
      a user: useradd -G admin mynewusername       using an actual user name. . if
      we were doing more than this we would want to mount more things... but for this
      we shouldnt need to . then, because I like things clean, umount /dev/sda1 (or
      whatever your partition is) and reboot to the hd. . you would have to type exit
      before the umount... sorry... to leave the chroot jail . at login, press the
      little icon thingy in the corner and choose Unity. .'
    - no, greenit is saying his download speeds are slow, when connecting to a machine
      on his same LAN. I'm unsure why you think setting it up to go to the internet
      would be A) easier, and B) make it any faster . well that is probably the issue
      then. He needs to be at 1280x1024 instead of 1024x768 .
    - so I am working as a linux admin intern, and my boss told me to use "sudo su
      -" . all RHEL or centos boxes; is there a reason for that? . is it a traditional
      thing? did sudo -i not exist at some point .
    - no .
    - sudo restart lightdm .
    - We are talking 12.04 not 10.04 .
    - you can buy _anything_ in China .
    - you remember my flash issue from yesterday or the day before? .
    - oh, no idea other is probably ok . update-manager or even apt . it will be sorted
      to the right package by a bug triager, dont worry about it to much . since unity
      is a compiz plugin i would say everyone who uses unity does :) . as i said above,
      unity is a compiz plugin ... so it would be heavily noticed if compiz wouldnt
      work .

    - thanks . I would imagine so, the site bonny linked earlier explicitly states
      turn hamachi off .
    - not really.  i use urxvt myself. .
    - yes .
    - yes I've investigated that already. It seems you can't treat both super keys
      differently. .
    - ': is that a question ? .'
    - you're welcome .. since 12.04 throws dnsmasq into the mix by default (see http://www.stgraber.org/2012/02/24/dns-in-ubuntu-12-04/)
      complexities rise a bit .. maybe that page has some info on squid .
    - as someone else suggested, close update-manager, and open from terminal update-manager
      -d   but... it might be wise to wait for a point release. 1204 is als VERY different
      than 1004. You might grab a dvd and load it in VM and see if you are comfortable
      with the change. .
    - all of this possible in older versions of Ubuntu . *was possible .
    - thanks a lot, really! .

    - And because you only have 3 GB of ram, is not justified to run a 64 bit system
      there as 32 bit would run faster. .
    - It works fine without setting up an ssh tunnel manually. Fun thing is, that
      if one machine runs 11.10 and the other 12.04, the request from 12.04 to 11.10
      works, and a connection can be made. If both are 12.04 it doesn't work. . I've
      been thinking the same thing. I guess I'll have to file one :( . just wanted
      to check, not that I'm being stupid. . didn't test that since the other computer
      is 12.04 (a relative of mine) and I run different ubuntu versions on vbox. .
      oh, 64MB? well then... ;) . he should have enough RAM to keep it in tmpfs. .
    - i have no .docx files, so don't know, why not try it yourself .
    - but I'm sure I can work it out .
    - im not familiar with hotspot .
    - thanx .
    - i've booted countless distros from USB on my AAO . years of experience.. :)
      . i know, and my experience tells me your results will be negative .
    - so it has two be a two-command process? .
    - the way you put it, that sounds like a severe case of PEBKAC ;) .
    - its ok but no error? then how do you know its a problem with dhcp client? .

    - ya, but I guess you could do a git of your ENTIRE OS, and that would be the
      same xD .
    - noexec is a mount option. you would have to create a partition and mount it
      .
    - did you overwrite your win install or can you browse that drive from ubuntu?
      . your mbr was fine if you were booting ubuntu, you likely just needed to ask
      grub to let you chose which OS you want before auto booting ubuntu . odd, you
      could manualy add it if needed .
    - that's right, while chatting I regrettably make a lot of typo's. .
    - For the most part, you should be installing python modules through packages
      available in our repositories. But pip or easy_install or manual via distutils
      would be the next course of action. .

    - afaik it's best to start at 2mb = 2048k .
    - for some reason the headphones option does not change .
    - Well then I don't know. Can anything boot on the computer? .

    - I've tried it. not a fan at all . I have no desire to learn a new way of using
      the app just because people are duplicating the limitations of less powerful
      window managers .
    - Not to mention WAY less complex ... you can have a setup in under 10 lines .
    - ok i will try that, brb . it complains about export not being an identifier...
      never heard of the command myself . and there is no man entry for export .
    - I did system annalysis and it said everything passed 100% .
    - well, you can, according to that article, i also noticed the watermark vunerability.
      .
    - AH, okay .
    - if not, I think you can pretty much grab any USB analog video converter that
      complies to the device class and use that . not sure which software, though
      .
    - ouch .
