      \ you expect . \n how urgent is #896? . \n not particularly urgent, but a policy\
      \ violation . \n i agree that we should kill the -novtswitch . \n ok . \n would\
      \ you consider a package split a feature? . \n context? . \n splitting xfonts*\
      \ out of xfree86*. one upload for the rest of the life and that's it . \n splitting\
      \ the source package you mean? . \n yes. same binary packages. . \n I would\
      \ prefer to avoid it at this stage.  this is something that has gone into XSF\
      \ svn, I assume? ."

    text: "afternoon all . not entirely related to warty, but if grub-install takes\
      \ 5 minutes to install, is this a sign that i should just retry the install\
      \ :) . \n here  . \n you might want to know that thinice in warty is buggy compared\
      \ to that in sid . \n and apparently GNOME is suddently almost perfect (out\
      \ of the thinice problem), nobody report bugs :-P . I don't get your question,\
      \ where do you want to paste ? . \n can i file the panel not linking to eds?\
      \ :) . \n are you using alt ? or the windows key ? . wait for the gnome-themes,\
      \ component will be added . \n i just restarted X and now nautilus won't show\
      \ the desktop :( . hal isn't starting :( . \n do you think we have any interest\
      \ to have hal support turned on in gnome-vfs at this point ? It increases the\
      \ sources of problems for no real benefit imho ... . \n is it a known bug that\
      \ g-s-t doesn't know what distribution its running on? . are there any changes\
      \ to desktop-file-utils you've got hidden away? . \n somebody should really\
      \ kick that guy *hard* . I've added a build-dep on libxt-dev in warty for zenity\
      \ . \n arse. xt-dev? i added libx11-dev . so just libxt-dev or libxt and libx11?\
      \ . for future note, the xmodmap line in that X sticky-super fixes the problem\
      \ for me . \n we have planned to speak about menu organisation during the 2\
      \ weeks . I need we don't need to force it . ? . \n was away, you said ? . nope\
      \ . \n the warty repository . ok, fine. Thanks . nice to get packages update\
      \ every 30min instead once a day, isn't it :) . \n you'll be glad to know i've\
      \ fixed my missing arrows in thinice bug . \n I've uploaded the gnome-vfs without\
      \ hal support should be available rsn . \n should g2 in ubuntu do the magic\
      \ dont-focus-window tricks? . join the gang, get an x-series thinkpad . sj has\

      \ . it's more wizardy . so the first page is okayish . we can do a whole load\
      \ better on the second page (icons, translated descriptions) . but that's the\
      \ kind of thing i was thinking about . (a single big treeview would get very\
