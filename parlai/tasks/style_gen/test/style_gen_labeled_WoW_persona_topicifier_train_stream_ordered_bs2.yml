        organizations to connect to the Internet using computer terminals, computers,
        and other devices; and to access services such as email and the World Wide
        Web.

        Internet access Various technologies, at a wide range of speeds have been
        used by Internet service providers (ISPs) to provide this service.

        Internet access Internet access was once rare, but has grown rapidly.

        Internet access In 1995, only percent of the world''s population had access,
        with well over half of those living in the United States, and consumer use
        was through dial-up.

        Internet access By the first decade of the 21st century, many consumers in
        developed nations used faster broadband technology, and by 2014, 41 percent
        of the world''s population had access, broadband was almost ubiquitous worldwide,
        and global average connection speeds exceeded 1 Mbit/s.

        Internet access The Internet developed from the ARPANET, which was funded
        by the US government to support projects within the government and at universities
        and research laboratories in the US – but grew over time to include most of
        the world''s large universities and the research arms of many technology companies.

        Internet access Use by a wider audience only came in 1995 when restrictions
        on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic were lifted.

        Right to Internet access The right to Internet access, also known as the right
        to broadband or freedom to connect, is the view that all people must be able
        to access the Internet in order to exercise and enjoy their rights to freedom
        of expression and opinion and other fundamental human rights, that states
        have a responsibility to ensure that Internet access is broadly available,
        and that states may not unreasonably restrict an individual''s access to the
        Internet.

        Right to Internet access In December 2003 the World Summit on the Information
        Society (WSIS) was convened under the auspice of the United Nations.

        Right to Internet access After lengthy negotiations between governments, businesses
        and civil society representatives the WSIS Declaration of Principles was adopted
        reaffirming the importance of the Information Society to maintaining and strengthening
        human rights:  The WSIS Declaration of Principles makes specific reference
        to the importance of the right to freedom of expression in the "Information
        Society" in stating:  A poll of 27,973 adults in 26 countries, including 14,306

        Digital divide in Canada The digital divide in Canada refers to the discrepancy
        that exists between Canadians who have access to information and communication
        technologies (ICT) and the benefits they provide compared to those who don''t.

        Digital divide in Canada This divide can be the result of many factors including
        high costs for technology and online access, differences in the availability
        of online connectivity resources in different locations across the country,
        and lacking digital literacy.

        Digital divide in Canada The digital divide in Canada also stems from income
        inequality among Canadians and differences in online connectivity practices
        exhibited by those of different age, gender, first language, and cultural
        background.

        Digital divide by country The digital divide is an economic and social inequality
        with regard to access to, use of, or impact of information and communication
        technologies (ICT).

        Digital divide by country Factors causing the divide can vary depending on
        the country and culture, as can the potential solutions for minimizing or
        closing the divide.

        National broadband plan Broadband is a term normally considered to be synonymous
        with a high-speed connection to the internet.

        National broadband plan Suitability for certain applications, or technically
        a certain quality of service, is often assumed.

        National broadband plan For instance, low round trip delay (or "latency" in
        milliseconds) would normally be assumed to be well under 150ms and suitable
        for Voice over IP, online gaming, financial trading especially arbitrage,
        virtual private networks and other latency-sensitive applications.

        National broadband plan This would rule out satellite Internet as inherently
        high-latency.

        National broadband plan In some applications, utility-grade reliability (measured
        for example in seconds per 30 years outage time as in the PSTN network) or
        security (say AES-128 as required for smart grid applications in the US) are
        often also assumed or defined as requirements.

        "Epic of Gilgamesh" (earliest Sumerian text versions c. 2150–2000 BCE).

        History of science fiction A second approach argues that science fiction only
        became possible sometime between the 17th and early 19th centuries, following
        the scientific revolution and major discoveries in astronomy, physics, and
        mathematics.

        field or other device.

        Hyperspace (science fiction) As seen in most fiction hyperspace is most succinctly
        described as a "somewhere else" within which the laws of general and special

        of light being the cosmic speed limit.

        of scientific plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction
        is traditionally held.

        Time travel Time travel is the concept of movement between certain points
        in time, analogous to movement between different points in space by an object
        or a person, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine,
        in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in spacetime,
        either to an earlier time or to a later time, without the need for the time-traveling
        body to experience the intervening period in the usual sense.

        of Madagascar", and the Netflix series "All Hail King Julien".

        List of Madagascar (franchise) characters Tom McGrath explained in an interview
        that the intention of "Madagascar" was not to take a political stance on whether
        "zoos are bad and the wild is better, or that the wild is bad," but to show
        "the most extreme ''fish out of water'' story that [they] could do".

        List of Madagascar (franchise) characters McGrath stated "the basic irony
        to the story is that, you think animals do belong in the wild, but if they''re
        so accustomed to civility, they wouldn''t know where food even came from,"
        and the animals were meant to "love the zoo and to love where they are because
        they''ve got" "right off Fifth Avenue".

        in industrial rock and electronic music, founded by John Malm Jr. and Trent
        Reznor in 1992.

        Digital divide by country The digital divide is an economic and social inequality
        with regard to access to, use of, or impact of information and communication
        technologies (ICT).

        Digital divide by country Factors causing the divide can vary depending on
        the country and culture, as can the potential solutions for minimizing or
        closing the divide.

        Digital divide by country The following is a list of countries that have a
        digital divide along with contributing factors and steps the country is taking
        to resolve the issue.

        Digital divide by country The digital divide in Argentina is the term used
        to describe the technological and connectivity gap between different demographics
        and regions, specifically the gaps present in the country of Argentina.

        Digital divide in the United States The digital divide in the United States
        refers to inequalities between individuals, households, and other groups of
        different demographic and socioeconomic levels in "access" to information
        and communication technologies ("ICTs") and in the "knowledge and skills"
        needed to effectively use the information gained from connecting.

        Digital divide in the United States The global digital divide refers to inequalities
        in access, knowledge, and skills, but designates countries as the units of
        analysis and examines the divide between developing and developed countries
        on an international scale.

        Digital divide in the United States Although the digital divide in American
        has decreased considerably, there are still certain groups of Americans with
        limited access.

        National broadband plan Broadband is a term normally considered to be synonymous
        with a high-speed connection to the internet.

        National broadband plan Suitability for certain applications, or technically
        a certain quality of service, is often assumed.

        National broadband plan For instance, low round trip delay (or "latency" in
        milliseconds) would normally be assumed to be well under 150ms and suitable
        for Voice over IP, online gaming, financial trading especially arbitrage,
        virtual private networks and other latency-sensitive applications.

        National broadband plan This would rule out satellite Internet as inherently
        high-latency.

        National broadband plan In some applications, utility-grade reliability (measured
        for example in seconds per 30 years outage time as in the PSTN network) or
        security (say AES-128 as required for smart grid applications in the US) are
        often also assumed or defined as requirements.

        Right to Internet access The right to Internet access, also known as the right
        to broadband or freedom to connect, is the view that all people must be able
        to access the Internet in order to exercise and enjoy their rights to freedom
        of expression and opinion and other fundamental human rights, that states
        have a responsibility to ensure that Internet access is broadly available,
        and that states may not unreasonably restrict an individual''s access to the
        Internet.

        Right to Internet access In December 2003 the World Summit on the Information
        Society (WSIS) was convened under the auspice of the United Nations.

        Right to Internet access After lengthy negotiations between governments, businesses
        and civil society representatives the WSIS Declaration of Principles was adopted
        reaffirming the importance of the Information Society to maintaining and strengthening
        human rights:  The WSIS Declaration of Principles makes specific reference
        to the importance of the right to freedom of expression in the "Information
        Society" in stating:  A poll of 27,973 adults in 26 countries, including 14,306
        Internet users, conducted for the BBC World Service between 30 November 2009
        and 7 February 2010 found that almost four in five Internet users and non-users
        around the world felt that access to the Internet was a fundamental right.

        Internet The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks
        that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide.

        Internet It is a "network of networks" that consists of private, public, academic,
        business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad
        array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies.

        Internet The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services,
        such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World
        Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.

        Internet The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by
        the United States Federal Government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant
        communication via computer networks.

      knowledge: 'Science fiction Science fiction (often shortened to SF or sci-fi)
        is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts
        such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster
        than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life.

        Science fiction Science fiction often explores the potential consequences
        of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a "literature of
        ideas".

        Science fiction It usually avoids the supernatural, unlike the related genre
        of fantasy.

        Science fiction Historically, science-fiction stories have had a grounding
        in actual science, but now this is only expected of hard science fiction.

        Science fiction Science fiction is difficult to define, as it includes a wide
        range of subgenres and themes.

        Science fiction Hugo Gernsback, who suggested the term "scientifiction" for
        his "Amazing Stories" magazine, wrote: "By ''scientifiction'' I mean the Jules
        Verne, H. G. Wells and Edgar Allan Poe type of story—a charming romance intermingled
        with scientific fact and prophetic vision... Not only do these amazing tales
        make tremendously interesting reading—they are always instructive.

        Science fiction They supply knowledge... in a very palatable form... New adventures
        pictured for us in the scientifiction of today are not at all impossible of
        realization tomorrow...

        Science fiction film Science fiction film (or sci-fi film) is a genre that
        uses speculative, fictional science-based depictions of phenomena that are
        not fully accepted by mainstream science, such as extraterrestrial lifeforms,
        alien worlds, extrasensory perception and time travel, along with futuristic
        elements such as spacecraft, robots, cyborgs, interstellar travel or other
        technologies.

        Science fiction film Science fiction films have often been used to focus on
        political or social issues, and to explore philosophical issues like the human
        condition.

        Science fiction film In many cases, tropes derived from written science fiction
        may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards
        of scientific plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction
        is traditionally held.

        History of science fiction The literary genre of science fiction is diverse,
        and its exact definition remains a contested question among both scholars
        and devotees.

        History of science fiction This lack of consensus is reflected in debates
        about the genre''s history, particularly over determining its exact origins.

        History of science fiction There are two broad camps of thought, one that
        identifies the genre''s roots in early fantastical works such as the Sumerian
        "Epic of Gilgamesh" (earliest Sumerian text versions c. 2150–2000 BCE).

        History of science fiction A second approach argues that science fiction only
        became possible sometime between the 17th and early 19th centuries, following
        the scientific revolution and major discoveries in astronomy, physics, and
        mathematics.

        Time travel Time travel is the concept of movement between certain points
        in time, analogous to movement between different points in space by an object
        or a person, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine,
        in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in spacetime,
        either to an earlier time or to a later time, without the need for the time-traveling
        body to experience the intervening period in the usual sense.

        Time travel Time travel is a widely-recognized concept in philosophy and fiction.

        Time travel It was popularized by H. G. Wells'' 1895 novel "The Time Machine",
        which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination.

        Parallel universes in fiction A parallel universe is a hypothetical self-contained
        reality co-existing with one''s own.

        Parallel universes in fiction A specific group of parallel universes are called
        a "multiverse", although this term can also be used to describe the possible
        parallel universes that constitute reality.

        Parallel universes in fiction While the terms "parallel universe" and "alternative
        reality" are generally synonymous and can be used interchangeably in most
        cases, there is sometimes an additional connotation implied with the term
        "alternative reality" that implies that the reality is a variant of our own.

        Parallel universes in fiction The term "parallel universe" is more general,
        without any connotations implying a relationship, or lack of relationship,
        with our own universe.

        Alternate history Alternate history or alternative history (Commonwealth English),
        sometimes abbreviated as AH, is a genre of fiction consisting of stories in
        which one or more historical events occur differently.

        Alternate history These stories usually contain "what if" scenarios at crucial
        points in history and present outcomes other than those in the historical
        record.

        Alternate history The stories are conjectural, but are sometimes based on
        fact.

        Alternate history Alternate history has been seen as a subgenre of literary
        fiction, science fiction, or historical fiction; alternate history works may
        use tropes from any or all of these genres.

        Alternate history Another term occasionally used for the genre is "allohistory"
        (literally "other history").

        Time travel in fiction Time travel is a common theme in fiction and has been
        depicted in a variety of media, such as literature, television, film, and
        advertisements.

        Time travel in fiction The concept of time travel by mechanical means was
        popularized in H. G. Wells'' 1895 story, "The Time Machine".

        Time travel in fiction In general, time travel stories focus on the consequences
        of traveling into the past or the future.

        Time travel in fiction The central premise for these stories oftentimes involves
        changing history, either intentionally or by accident, and the ways by which
        altering the past changes the future and creates an altered present or future
        for the time traveler when they return home.

        Road space rationing Road space rationing, also known as alternate-day travel,
        driving restriction, no-drive days, (; ; ) is a travel demand management strategy
        aimed to reduce the negative externalities generated by urban air pollution
        or peak urban travel demand in excess of available supply or road capacity,
        through artificially restricting demand (vehicle travel) by rationing the
        scarce common good road capacity, especially during the peak periods or during
        peak pollution events.

        Road space rationing This objective is achieved by restricting traffic access
        into an urban cordon area, city center (CBD), or district based upon the last
        digits of the license number on pre-established days and during certain periods,
        usually, the peak hours.

        Photography Photography is the science, art, application and practice of creating
        durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either
        electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive
        material such as photographic film.

        Photography Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted
        from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera
        during a timed exposure.

        Photography With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge
        at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image
        file for subsequent display or processing.

        Aerial photography Aerial photography is the taking of photographs from an
        aircraft or other flying object.

        Aerial photography Platforms for aerial photography include fixed-wing aircraft,
        helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or "drones"), balloons, blimps
        and dirigibles, rockets, pigeons, kites, parachutes, stand-alone telescoping
        and vehicle-mounted poles.

        Aerial photography Mounted cameras may be triggered remotely or automatically;
        hand-held photographs may be taken by a photographer.

        Aerial photography Aerial photography should not be confused with air-to-air
        photography, where one or more aircraft are used as chase planes that "chase"
        and photograph other aircraft in flight.

        Politics of Harry Potter There are many published theories about the politics

        criticism of racism to anti-government sentiments.

        Politics of Harry Potter There are also several university courses centred
        on analysis of the Potter series, including an upper division Political Science
        course.

        Politics of Harry Potter "Time" magazine noted the political and social aspects
        of Harry Potter in their 2007 Person of the Year issue where Rowling placed
        third behind politicians Vladimir Putin and Al Gore.

        Religious debates over the Harry Potter series Religious debates over the
        "Harry Potter" series of books by J. K. Rowling are based on claims that the
        novels contain occult or Satanic subtexts.

        Religious debates over the Harry Potter series A number of Protestant, Catholic,
        and Orthodox Christians have argued against the series, as have some Shia
        and Sunni Muslims.

        Religious debates over the Harry Potter series Supporters of the series have
        said that the magic in "Harry Potter" bears little resemblance to occultism,
        being more in the vein of fairy tales such as "Cinderella" and "Snow White",
        or to the works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, both of whom are known
        for writing fantasy novels with Christian subtexts.

        Religious debates over the Harry Potter series Far from promoting a particular

        around the edge; on normal Galleons these serial numbers aren''t used the
        same way the enchanted coins are used, the numbers represent the time and
        date of the next meeting, and automatically change to match whatever numbers
        Harry Potter sets on his coin.

        Magical objects in Harry Potter Due to the coins being infused with a Protean
        Charm, once Harry Potter alters his, every coin changes to suit.

        Bass amplifier A bass amplifier or "bass amp" is a musical instrument electronic
        device that uses electrical power to make lower-pitched instruments such as
        the bass guitar or double bass loud enough to be heard by the performers and
        audience.

        Bass amplifier Bass amps typically consist of a preamplifier, tone controls,
        a power amplifier and one or more loudspeakers ("drivers") in a cabinet.

        Bass amplifier While bass amps share many features with the guitar amplifiers
        used for electric guitar, such as providing an amplifier with tone and volume
        controls and a carrying handle, they are distinct from other types of amplification
        systems, due to the particular challenges associated with low-frequency sound
        reproduction.

        according to local regulation.

        Homebrewing Beer has been brewed domestically throughout its 7,000-year history,
        beginning in the Neolithic period in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), Egypt and
        China.

        Homebrewing It seems to have first developed as thick beers; during this time
        meads, fruit wines and rice wines were also developed.

        Homebrewing Women brewers dominated alcohol production on every occupied continent
        until commercialization and industrialization of brewing occurred.

        Homebrewing The tradition of brewing being in the domain of women stemmed
        from the fact that brewing was a by-product of gathering, and often considered
        a part of baking.

        Homebrewing The Greeks and Romans cultivated both grape wine and beer, to
        a lesser extent.

        Homebrewing Roman women often directed production in larger households while
        the labor was performed by slaves.

        Homebrewing By the Tang dynasty, homebrewing seems to have been a familiar
        domestic chore in China, albeit the lower classes had to make do with poorly-filtered
        mash.

        Homebrewing Laws against making alcohol were enacted and repealed between
        the Zhou and Ming dynasties.

        Beer Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drinks in
        the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea.

        Beer Beer is brewed from cereal grains—most commonly from malted barley, though
        wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used.

        Beer During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the
        wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer.

        Beer Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other
        flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent.

        Beer Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included
        or used instead of hops.
