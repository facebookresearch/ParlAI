        Soft drink A soft drink (see terminology for other names) is a drink that
        typically contains carbonated water (although lemonade, among others, is usually
        not carbonated), a sweetener, and a natural or artificial flavoring.

        Soft drink The sweetener may be sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice,
        sugar substitutes (in the case of diet drinks), or some combination of these.

        Soft drink Soft drinks may also contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives,
        and other ingredients.

        Soft drink Soft drinks are called "soft" in contrast with "hard" alcoholic
        beverages.

        Soft drink Small amounts of alcohol may be present in a soft drink, but the
        alcohol content must be less than 0.5% of the total volume if the drink is
        to be considered non-alcoholic.

        Sugary drink tax A sugary drink tax or soda tax is a tax or surcharge designed
        to reduce consumption of drinks with added sugar.

        Sugary drink tax Drinks covered under a soda tax often include carbonated
        soft drinks, sports drinks and energy drinks.

        Sugary drink tax The tax is a matter of public debate in many countries and
        beverage producers like Coca-Cola often oppose it.

        Sugary drink tax Advocates such as national medical associations and the World
        Health Organization (WHO) promote the tax as an example of Pigovian taxation,
        aimed to discourage unhealthy diets and offset the growing economic costs
        of obesity.

        Sugary drink tax Type II Diabetes is a growing health concern in many developed
        and developing countries around the world, with 1.6 million deaths directly
        due to type II diabetes in 2015 alone.

        Diet drink Diet (alternatively marketed as sugar-free, zero-calorie or low-calorie)
        drinks are sugar-free, artificially sweetened versions of fizzy beverages
        with virtually no calories.

        Diet drink They are generally marketed toward health-conscious people, diabetics,
        athletes, and other people who want to lose weight, improve physical fitness,
        or reduce their sugar intake.

        Diet drink The beginning of the diet drink or refreshment era was in 1952,
        when Kirsch Bottling in Brooklyn, New York launched a sugar-free ginger ale
        called No-Cal.

        Diet drink It was designed for diabetics, not dieters, and distribution remained
        local.

        Diet drink Royal Crown Cola placed an announcement in an Atlanta newspaper
        in 1958 announcing a diet product, Diet Rite.

        Energy drink An energy drink is a type of beverage containing stimulant drugs,
        usually including caffeine, which is marketed as providing mental and physical
        stimulation (marketed as "energy", but distinct from food energy).

        Energy drink They may or may not be carbonated and many also contain sugar
        or other sweeteners, herbal extracts, taurine, and amino acids.

        Energy drink They are a subset of the larger group of energy products, which
        includes bars and gels, and distinct from sports drinks, which are advertised
        to enhance sports performance.

        Energy drink There are many brands and varieties of energy drinks.

        Energy drink Coffee, tea and other naturally caffeinated beverages are usually
        not considered energy drinks.

        Benzene in soft drinks Benzene in soft drinks is of potential concern due
        to the carcinogenic nature of the benzene molecule.

        Benzene in soft drinks This contamination is a public health concern and has
        caused significant outcry among environmental and health advocates.

        Benzene in soft drinks Benzene levels are regulated in drinking water nationally
        and internationally, and in bottled water in the United States, but only informally
        in soft drinks.

        Benzene in soft drinks The benzene forms from decarboxylation of the preservative
        benzoic acid in the presence of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and metal ions (iron
        and copper) that act as catalysts, especially under heat and light.

        Benzene in soft drinks The major cause of benzene in soft drinks is the decarboxylation
        of benzoic acid in the presence of ascorbic acid (vitamin C, E300) or erythorbic
        acid (a diastereomer of ascorbic acid, E315).

        Container deposit legislation Container-deposit legislation (also known as
        a deposit-refund scheme, bottle bill, or deposit-return system) is any law
        that requires the collection of a monetary deposit on beverage containers
        (refillable or non-refillable) at the point of sale.

        Container deposit legislation When the container is returned to an authorized
        redemption center, or retailer in some jurisdictions, the deposit is partly
        or fully refunded to the redeemer (presumed to be the original purchaser).

        Container deposit legislation It is a deposit-refund system.

        Container deposit legislation Governments may pass container deposit legislation
        for several reasons, including, for example:  Deposits that are not redeemed
        are often kept by distributors or bottlers to cover the costs of the system
        (including handling fees paid to retailers or redemption enters to collect,
        sort, and handle the containers) or are escheated to the governmental entity
        involved to fund environmental programs.

        of teams away from their traditional districts is unusual because of the nature
        of the relationship between clubs and their fans: the local football club
        is regarded by most English football supporters as part of the local identity
        and social fabric rather than as a business that can be transplanted by its
        owners at will.

        time Dr Pepper was served.

        Dr Pepper It was introduced nationally in the United States at the 1904 Louisiana
        Purchase Exposition as a new kind of soda pop, made with 23 flavors.

        by one year.

        Dr Pepper It was formulated by Brooklyn-born pharmacist Charles Alderton in
        Morrison''s Old Corner Drug Store in Waco, Texas.

        Dr Pepper To test his new drink, he first offered it to store owner Wade Morrison,
        who also found it to his liking.

        Dr Pepper Patrons at Morrison''s soda fountain soon learned of Alderton''s
        new drink and began ordering a "Waco".

        Dr Pepper Alderton gave the formula to Morrison, who named it Dr. Pepper (later
        stylized as "Dr Pepper").

        New Coke New Coke was the unofficial name for the reformulation of Coca-Cola
        introduced in April 1985 by the Coca-Cola Company to replace the original
        formula of its flagship soft drink, Coca-Cola (also called Coke).

        New Coke New Coke originally had no separate name of its own but was simply
        known as "the new taste of Coca-Cola" until 1992, when it was renamed Coke
        Ⅱ.  Coca-Cola''s market share had been losing ground to diet soft drinks and
        non-cola beverages for many years.

        New Coke Consumers who were purchasing regular colas seemed to prefer the
        sweeter taste of rival Pepsi-Cola, as Coca-Cola learned in conducting blind
        taste tests.

        and the kola nuts used in the recipe.

        Pepsi The original recipe also included sugar and vanilla.

        Pepsi Bradham sought to create a fountain drink that was appealing and would
        aid in digestion and boost energy.

        Coca-Cola Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink produced by The Coca-Cola
        Company.

        Coca-Cola Originally intended as a patent medicine, it was invented in the
        late 19th century by John Pemberton and was bought out by businessman Asa
        Griggs Candler, whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of
        the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century.

        Coca-Cola The drink''s name refers to two of its original ingredients, which
        were kola nuts (a source of caffeine) and coca leaves.

        in the underlying message for the logo.

        Cola wars The cola wars are a series of mutually-targeted television advertisements
        and marketing campaigns since the 1980s between two long-time rival soft drink
        producers, The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo.

        Cola wars The battle between the two dominant brands in the United States
        intensified to such an extent that the term “Cola wars” was used to describe
        the feud.

        Cola wars Each employed numerous advertising and marketing campaigns to outdo
        the other.

        Cola wars Short periods of intense competition between the two firms contrast
        with how the two firms avoid competition most of the time by focusing on different
        consumers, sponsoring different sports, differentiating their logos, choosing
        different colors for their packaging, and building different images for their
        brand.

        Diet Pepsi Diet Pepsi and Diet Pepsi Classic Formula Blend are no-calorie

        was re-branded as "Diet Pepsi" the following year, becoming the first diet
        cola to be distributed on a national scale in the United States.

        Diet Pepsi In the 1960s and 1970s its competition consisted of Tab, produced
        by The Coca-Cola Company, and Diet Rite soda, produced by Royal Crown.

        Diet Pepsi Diet Coke was a later entrant to the diet cola market; though shortly
        after entering production in 1982 it became the primary competing diet cola
        to Diet Pepsi.
