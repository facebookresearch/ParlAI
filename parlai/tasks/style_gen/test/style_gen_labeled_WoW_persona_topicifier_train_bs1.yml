      Soft drink A soft drink (see terminology for other names) is a drink that typically
      contains carbonated water (although lemonade, among others, is usually not carbonated),
      a sweetener, and a natural or artificial flavoring.

      Soft drink The sweetener may be sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice,
      sugar substitutes (in the case of diet drinks), or some combination of these.

      Soft drink Soft drinks may also contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives,
      and other ingredients.

      Soft drink Soft drinks are called "soft" in contrast with "hard" alcoholic beverages.

      Soft drink Small amounts of alcohol may be present in a soft drink, but the
      alcohol content must be less than 0.5% of the total volume if the drink is to
      be considered non-alcoholic.

      Sugary drink tax A sugary drink tax or soda tax is a tax or surcharge designed
      to reduce consumption of drinks with added sugar.

      Sugary drink tax Drinks covered under a soda tax often include carbonated soft
      drinks, sports drinks and energy drinks.

      Sugary drink tax The tax is a matter of public debate in many countries and
      beverage producers like Coca-Cola often oppose it.

      Sugary drink tax Advocates such as national medical associations and the World
      Health Organization (WHO) promote the tax as an example of Pigovian taxation,
      aimed to discourage unhealthy diets and offset the growing economic costs of
      obesity.

      Sugary drink tax Type II Diabetes is a growing health concern in many developed
      and developing countries around the world, with 1.6 million deaths directly
      due to type II diabetes in 2015 alone.

      Diet drink Diet (alternatively marketed as sugar-free, zero-calorie or low-calorie)
      drinks are sugar-free, artificially sweetened versions of fizzy beverages with
      virtually no calories.

      Diet drink They are generally marketed toward health-conscious people, diabetics,
      athletes, and other people who want to lose weight, improve physical fitness,
      or reduce their sugar intake.

      Diet drink The beginning of the diet drink or refreshment era was in 1952, when
      Kirsch Bottling in Brooklyn, New York launched a sugar-free ginger ale called
      No-Cal.

      Diet drink It was designed for diabetics, not dieters, and distribution remained
      local.

      Diet drink Royal Crown Cola placed an announcement in an Atlanta newspaper in
      1958 announcing a diet product, Diet Rite.

      Energy drink An energy drink is a type of beverage containing stimulant drugs,
      usually including caffeine, which is marketed as providing mental and physical
      stimulation (marketed as "energy", but distinct from food energy).

      Energy drink They may or may not be carbonated and many also contain sugar or
      other sweeteners, herbal extracts, taurine, and amino acids.

      Energy drink They are a subset of the larger group of energy products, which
      includes bars and gels, and distinct from sports drinks, which are advertised
      to enhance sports performance.

      Energy drink There are many brands and varieties of energy drinks.

      Energy drink Coffee, tea and other naturally caffeinated beverages are usually
      not considered energy drinks.

      Benzene in soft drinks Benzene in soft drinks is of potential concern due to
      the carcinogenic nature of the benzene molecule.

      Benzene in soft drinks This contamination is a public health concern and has
      caused significant outcry among environmental and health advocates.

      Benzene in soft drinks Benzene levels are regulated in drinking water nationally
      and internationally, and in bottled water in the United States, but only informally
      in soft drinks.

      Benzene in soft drinks The benzene forms from decarboxylation of the preservative
      benzoic acid in the presence of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and metal ions (iron
      and copper) that act as catalysts, especially under heat and light.

      Benzene in soft drinks The major cause of benzene in soft drinks is the decarboxylation
      of benzoic acid in the presence of ascorbic acid (vitamin C, E300) or erythorbic
      acid (a diastereomer of ascorbic acid, E315).

      Container deposit legislation Container-deposit legislation (also known as a
      deposit-refund scheme, bottle bill, or deposit-return system) is any law that
      requires the collection of a monetary deposit on beverage containers (refillable
      or non-refillable) at the point of sale.

      Container deposit legislation When the container is returned to an authorized
      redemption center, or retailer in some jurisdictions, the deposit is partly
      or fully refunded to the redeemer (presumed to be the original purchaser).

      Container deposit legislation It is a deposit-refund system.

      Container deposit legislation Governments may pass container deposit legislation
      for several reasons, including, for example:  Deposits that are not redeemed
      are often kept by distributors or bottlers to cover the costs of the system
      (including handling fees paid to retailers or redemption enters to collect,
      sort, and handle the containers) or are escheated to the governmental entity
      involved to fund environmental programs.

      seltzer, bubbly water, or fizzy water, or the closely related club soda or soda
      water) is water into which carbon dioxide gas under pressure has been dissolved.

      effervescent.

      known as "the new taste of Coca-Cola" until 1992, when it was renamed Coke Ⅱ.  Coca-Cola''s
      market share had been losing ground to diet soft drinks and non-cola beverages

      and marketing campaigns since the 1980s between two long-time rival soft drink
      producers, The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo.

      Cola wars The battle between the two dominant brands in the United States intensified
      to such an extent that the term “Cola wars” was used to describe the feud.

      Cola wars Each employed numerous advertising and marketing campaigns to outdo
      the other.

      Cola wars Short periods of intense competition between the two firms contrast
      with how the two firms avoid competition most of the time by focusing on different

      different colors for their packaging, and building different images for their
      brand.
