    - I hope it goes well! If it makes you feel any better, most of them are probably
      just as nervous and are looking for any excuse to relax and let their guard
      down, too. Good luck

    - aww. im sure you must feel proud of him
    - I know how you feel.  I moved away from my family and friends this summer.  Do

      to fly into my lane, and didn't see me. I honked and they swerved back into
      their lane, slammed on their brakes, and hit the water cones.

    situation: My mother stopped by my house one day and said she saw 3 dogs on the
      road, down from our house. They were starving, with ribs showing, and it was
      a mother dog and her two small puppies. Of course, my daughter wanted to bring
      them to our house, so we could feed and help them. We did, and my heart went
      out to them, as they were so sweet, but really were in a bad shape.
