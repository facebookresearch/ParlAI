      \ a quantity of 3. Try hard to get as much value as you can, while still leaving\
      \ your partner satisfied and with a positive perception about you. If you fail\
      \ to come to an agreement, both parties get 5 points. Refer to the following\
      \ preference order and arguments for your negotiation: \n\nFood\nValue: 4 points\
