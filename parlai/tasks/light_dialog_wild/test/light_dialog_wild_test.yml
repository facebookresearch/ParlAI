      _setting_desc The viewing room is where those who have passed on come to watch
      their family members in the living world one day per year. The room resembles
      an opera theater. There are seats throughout the room and boxes for those who
      were wealthy in life to sit in. There is a stage with a large magical dome on
      it for viewing.
