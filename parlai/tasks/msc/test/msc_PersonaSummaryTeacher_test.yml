    text: 'I got some good news about my mom today! The tests all came back negative
      and she''s been feeling well.

      that''s great! what were they testing for again?

      Well they were testing for a bunch of different things. We''ve had a really
      difficult time narrowing it down.

      well i''m glad she''s okay.  I know how much she means to you.

      Thank you. Yes, I don''t know what I would do without her. How is your mother
      doing?

      she''s doing well.  The coffee shop has been getting good business lately so
      she''s very happy haha.  She had been stressed about money before.

      It''s so good to hear that things are going better for her. Do you work at her
      coffee shop or a different one?

      i work at hers.  I actually own it now.

      Oh, I see. What''s it like working with your mother? I think that I would get
      into too many arguments if I was working with mine, as much as I love her.

      It can be stressful sometimes but now that I''ve shown that I can run the place
      properly, she''s pretty hands off and just lets me do my thing.  We get along
      pretty well at work now.

      Well it''s good that it''s working out for you both! It''s good that she''s
      staying active. It''s been difficult to find things for my mother to do while
      she''s been sick.

      I''m sure she''ll be back at it soon.'
