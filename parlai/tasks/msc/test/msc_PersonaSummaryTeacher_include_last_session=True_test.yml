    text: 'I got some good news about my mom today! The tests all came back negative
      and she''s been feeling well.

      that''s great! what were they testing for again?

      Well they were testing for a bunch of different things. We''ve had a really
      difficult time narrowing it down.

      well i''m glad she''s okay.  I know how much she means to you.

      Thank you. Yes, I don''t know what I would do without her. How is your mother
      doing?

      she''s doing well.  The coffee shop has been getting good business lately so
      she''s very happy haha.  She had been stressed about money before.

      It''s so good to hear that things are going better for her. Do you work at her
      coffee shop or a different one?

      i work at hers.  I actually own it now.

      Oh, I see. What''s it like working with your mother? I think that I would get
      into too many arguments if I was working with mine, as much as I love her.

      It can be stressful sometimes but now that I''ve shown that I can run the place
      properly, she''s pretty hands off and just lets me do my thing.  We get along
      pretty well at work now.

      Well it''s good that it''s working out for you both! It''s good that she''s
      staying active. It''s been difficult to find things for my mother to do while
      she''s been sick.

      I''m sure she''ll be back at it soon.'

      \ need to stay in shape so when I finally do get to go a cruise I'll be looking\
      \ good!\nWhat are you making for dinner?\nWell I am going to make salmon on\
      \ the grill, with lemon and dill! I am going to make a kale salad to go along\
      \ with it. I am not sure how it will taste but it is healthy!\nI bet the salmon\
      \ will be great for you since you love fish. I've had good kale and bad kale,\
      \ so it's a coin flip! You going to be able to keep this up?\nHonestly, I am\
      \ not sure. I love food so much. Do you have any tips for maintaining? You must\
      \ have a very healthy diet being a vegan.\nYou really need to find the foods\
      \ that you enjoy. It might take a little time. No one will stay healthy eating\
      \ food they hate.\nI think I get bored of the food easily when I am dieting.\
      \ I need to switch it up. Do you have any exciting recipes?\nI make some really\
      \ good kale chips. They are healthy, crunchy, and tasty. Those sound any good>\n\
      hmm, tell me more! How do you make them? Do you add any type of seasoning to\
      \ them? \nWhatever seasoning you want. I like curry, jerk, and lemon-pepper.\
      \ Just toss with a little oil and bake in the oven\nOK, I will definitely try\
      \ it! Potato chips are my downfall, so this sounds like a much healthier alternative.\
      \ \nI don't even buy chips. If they are here, I eat them all. So I just don't\
      \ even let them in the home."

      I know how it is. I have two dogs and one cat. It gets interesting.

      That sounds hectic. What are their names?.

      Skippy and jetta for the dogs and the cat is foster. What''s your dog''s name.
