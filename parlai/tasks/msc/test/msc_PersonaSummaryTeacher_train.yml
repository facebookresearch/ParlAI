    text: 'Have you harvested anything recently?

      I harvested some turnips last night with my brother. We had a big crop this
      year!

      Nice! Do you sell them you use them for yourself? Do you have another source
      of income?

      Sometimes we sell them at the local farmer''s market, but we mostly keep them
      for our own use. I work for my father''s landscaping company. What do you do
      for a living?

      I''m a bartender with my boyfriend Jeff. It can be tiring but i get days off
      to spend time with my family.]

      What does your family think about Jeff?'

    text: 'I am planning a trip for this year, and I have never been to India before.

      Are you thinking about going to India this year then?

      Yes. Since your mother is from India, maybe you could invite her to dinner so
      I can pick her brain about their culture.

      That''s a lovely idea. Is there a time next week that would be good for you
      to come over?

      Any day next week works for me. Thank you for arranging this! I can not wait
      to meet her! Will your dad be there, too?

      I''ll have to check with them and get back to you about that haha. Where did
      you go last year?

      I went to Cambodia last year. It was amazing! It would be awesome if your dad
      could make us some Greek food next week. I love Greek food!'
