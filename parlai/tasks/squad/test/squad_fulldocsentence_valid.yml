    context: ' Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion
      of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season. The American Football
      Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference
      (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to win their third Super Bowl championship.
      The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi''s Stadium in Santa Clara,
      California (located in the San Francisco Bay Area). As this was the 50th Super
      Bowl, the league emphasized the "golden anniversary" with various gold-themed
      initiatives during the 2015 season, as well as suspending the tradition of naming
      each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been
      known as "Super Bowl L"), so the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals
      50.  The Panthers finished the regular season with a 15–1 record, racking up
      the league''s top offense, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most
      Valuable Player (MVP). They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49–15 in the NFC
      Championship Game and advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance since the
      franchise was founded in 1995. The Broncos finished the regular season with
      a 12–4 record, thanks to having the league''s top defense, and despite the struggles
      of starting quarterback Peyton Manning; they defeated the defending Super Bowl
      champion New England Patriots 20–18 in the AFC Championship Game. They joined
      the Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, and Pittsburgh Steelers as one of four teams that
      have made eight appearances in the Super Bowl.  In one of the most defensive
      Super Bowl matchups in NFL history, the Broncos took an early lead in Super
      Bowl 50 and never trailed. Denver recorded seven sacks and forced three turnovers.
      Carolina likewise kept pace by recording five sacks and forcing two turnovers.
      Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super Bowl MVP. This game was also the
      final game of Peyton Manning''s career; he announced his retirement on March
      7, 2016.  CBS'' broadcast of the game was the third most-watched program in
      American television history with an average of 111.9 million viewers. The network
      charged an average of $5 million for a 30-second commercial during the game.
      The Super Bowl 50 halftime show was headlined by Coldplay, with special guest
      performers Beyoncé and Bruno Mars.  In early 2012, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell
      stated that the league planned to make the 50th Super Bowl "spectacular" and
      that it would be "an important game for us as a league".  Cities included in
      early discussions or that submitted bids included:   The league eventually narrowed
      the bids to three sites: New Orleans'' Mercedes-Benz Superdome, Miami''s Sun
      Life Stadium, and the San Francisco Bay Area''s Levi''s Stadium.  The league
      announced on October 16, 2012, that the two finalists were Sun Life Stadium
      and Levi''s Stadium. The South Florida/Miami area has previously hosted the
      event 10 times (tied for most with New Orleans), with the most recent one being
      Super Bowl XLIV in 2010. The San Francisco Bay Area last hosted in 1985 (Super
      Bowl XIX), held at Stanford Stadium in Stanford, California, won by the home
      team 49ers. The Miami bid depended on whether the stadium underwent renovations.
      However, on May 3, 2013, the Florida legislature refused to approve the funding
      plan to pay for the renovations, dealing a significant blow to Miami''s chances.  On
      May 21, 2013, NFL owners at their spring meetings in Boston voted and awarded
      the game to Levi''s Stadium. The $1.2 billion stadium opened in 2014. It is
      the first Super Bowl held in the San Francisco Bay Area since Super Bowl XIX
      in 1985, and the first in California since Super Bowl XXXVII took place in San
      Diego in 2003.  For the third straight season, the number one seeds in the NFC
      and AFC, the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos, met in the Super Bowl. The
      game also featured the league''s top scoring offense (Panthers) against the
      league''s top defense (Broncos). The Panthers became the 10th team since 1960
      to have lost just one game during the regular season, and the sixth team ever
      to have a 15–1 record. It was their second Super Bowl appearance; the other
      was Super Bowl XXXVIII. The Broncos became the fourth team to have eight Super
      Bowl appearances. It was their second appearance in three years, having also
      reached Super Bowl XLVIII. Coincidentally, John Fox was the head coach of each
      team in their previous Super Bowl appearance.  Despite waiving long-time running
      back DeAngelo Williams and losing top wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn
      ACL in the preseason, the Carolina Panthers had their best regular season in
      franchise history, becoming the seventh team to win at least 15 regular season
      games since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in . Carolina started
      the season 14–0, not only setting franchise records for the best start and the
      longest single-season winning streak, but also posting the best start to a season
      by an NFC team in NFL history, breaking the 13–0 record previously shared with
      the 2009 New Orleans Saints and the 2011 Green Bay Packers. With their NFC-best
      15–1 regular season record, the Panthers clinched home-field advantage throughout
      the NFC playoffs for the first time in franchise history. Ten players were selected
      to the Pro Bowl (the most in franchise history) along with eight All-Pro selections.  The
      Panthers'' offense, which led the NFL in scoring (500 points), was loaded with
      talent, boasting six Pro Bowl selections. Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton had
      one of his best seasons, throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 yards,
      while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns (35 passing,
      10 rushing), a career-low 10 interceptions, and a career-best quarterback rating
      of 99.4. Newton''s leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen, who caught a
      career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns, and wide receiver
      Ted Ginn Jr., who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns; Ginn also
      rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards. Other key receivers
      included veteran Jerricho Cotchery (39 receptions for 485 yards), rookie Devin
      Funchess (31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns), and second-year
      receiver Corey Brown (31 receptions for 447 yards). The Panthers'' backfield
      featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart, who led the team with 989 rushing
      yards and six touchdowns in 13 games, along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert,
      who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards. Carolina''s
      offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections: center Ryan Kalil and
      guard Trai Turner.  The Panthers'' defense gave up just 308 points, ranking
      sixth in the league, while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and
      boasting four Pro Bowl selections. Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led
      the team in sacks with 11, while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two.
      Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6½ sacks. The Panthers defensive line also
      featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen, a 5-time Pro Bowl selection, who
      was the NFL''s active career sack leader with 136, along with defensive end
      Kony Ealy, who had five sacks in just nine starts. Behind them, two of the Panthers''
      three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl: Thomas
      Davis and Luke Kuechly. Davis compiled 5½ sacks, four forced fumbles, and four
      interceptions, while Kuechly led the team in tackles (118) forced two fumbles,
      and intercepted four passes of his own. Carolina''s secondary featured Pro Bowl
      safety Kurt Coleman, who led the team with a career high seven interceptions,
      while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman, who developed
      into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions, two of
      which were returned for touchdowns.  After losing in the divisional round of
      the playoffs during three of the previous four seasons, the Denver Broncos''
      general manager John Elway made numerous coaching changes, including a mutual
      parting with head coach John Fox, who had won four divisional championships
      in his four years as Broncos head coach, being replaced in that role by Gary
      Kubiak, Elway''s former backup quarterback and former Broncos offensive coordinator.
      Wade Phillips, a former Broncos head coach, returned to the team to serve his
      second stint as defensive coordinator, succeeding Jack Del Rio who had left
      to take the head coaching vacancy at the Oakland Raiders. The team''s 43–8 loss
      in Super Bowl XLVIII two years earlier, despite holding the regular season''s
      top offense, resulted in Elway signing defensive end DeMarcus Ware, cornerback
      Aqib Talib, safety T. J. Ward, and wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders for the 2014
      season.  Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense
      with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning''s shotgun passing
      style, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line,
      as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year
      with the Indianapolis Colts in , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel
      that he had suffered since the summer. In addition, Manning was getting old,
      as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Though the team had a 7–0 start, Manning
      led the NFL in interceptions. In Week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of
      the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL''s all-time record for
      career passing yards in this game, but after throwing four interceptions, he
      was benched in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as
      the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. After a slow start
      in Denver''s final regular season game against San Diego, Osweiler was benched
      leading to Manning''s return. Manning re-claimed the starting quarterback position
      for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team
      to clinch the AFC''s No. 1 seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips,
      who replaced his predecessor''s complicated read-and-react scheme with a simple
      aggressive approach of attacking the ball, the Broncos'' defense ranked No.
      1 in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous
      three seasons, the team continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise
      records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense,
      the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field
      advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.  Manning finished the year with a career-low
      67.9 passer rating, throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns, with 17 interceptions.
      In contrast, Osweiler threw for 1,967 yards, 10 touchdowns and six interceptions
      for a rating of 86.4. Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105
      receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns, while Emmanuel Sanders caught
      76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores, while adding another 106 yards returning
      punts. Tight end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with
      46 receptions for 517 yards. Running back C. J. Anderson was the team''s leading
      rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns, while also catching 25 passes for 183
      yards. Running back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards, five
      touchdowns, 24 receptions, and a 4.2 yards per carry average. Overall, the offense
      ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections.  The
      Broncos'' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed (4,530) for the first
      time in franchise history, and fourth in points allowed (296). Defensive ends
      Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson each had 5½ sacks. Pro Bowl linebacker Von Miller
      led the team with 11 sacks, forced four fumbles, and recovered three. Linebacker
      DeMarcus Ware was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the ninth time in his
      career, ranking second on the team with 7½ sacks. Linebacker Brandon Marshall
      led the team in total tackles with 109, while Danny Trevathan ranked second
      with 102 tackles. Cornerbacks Aqib Talib (three interceptions) and Chris Harris
      Jr. (two interceptions) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the defense,
      though none of the players selected for the Pro Bowl participated due to the
      Broncos reaching Super Bowl 50.  The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the
      divisional round, running up a 31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious
      second half comeback attempt to win 31–24, avenging their elimination from a
      year earlier. The Panthers then blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship
      Game, 49–15, racking up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers.  The Broncos
      defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round, 23–16, by scoring
      11 points in the final three minutes of the game. They then defeated the defending
      Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game,
      20–18, by intercepting a pass on New England''s 2-point conversion attempt with
      17 seconds left on the clock and recovering a subsequent onside kick attempt.  Carolina
      suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis, an 11-year veteran who had already
      overcome three ACL tears in his career, went down with a broken arm in the NFC
      Championship Game. Despite this, he insisted he would still find a way to play
      in the Super Bowl. His prediction turned out to be accurate and he made it into
      the starting lineup.  Peyton Manning reached his fourth Super Bowl, with appearances
      under as many head coaches (Tony Dungy, Jim Caldwell, John Fox and Gary Kubiak).
      He became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple
      Super Bowls. He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl
      at age 39. The past record was held by John Elway, who led the Broncos to victory
      in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver''s Executive Vice President
      of Football Operations and General Manager.  Manning and Newton set the record
      for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13
      years and 48 days (Manning was 39, Newton was 26). In addition, this was the
      first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the #1 pick
      in their draft classes. Manning was the #1 selection of the 1998 NFL Draft,
      while Newton was picked first in 2011. The matchup also pits the top two picks
      of the 2011 draft against each other: Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for
      Denver.  With Ron Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in
      Super Bowl XX, and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos'' defeats
      in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV, this was the first Super Bowl in which both head
      coaches played in the game themselves; coincidentally, the coaches they had
      played under, Mike Ditka (Rivera) and Dan Reeves (Kubiak), not only had Super
      Bowl playing experience themselves, but had done so as teammates with the Dallas
      Cowboys in Super Bowls V and VI (and worked together as Cowboys assistant coaches
      for Super Bowls X, XII and XIII).  Concerns were raised over whether Levi''s
      Stadium''s field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl; during the
      inaugural season, the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various
      issues, and earlier in the 2015 season, a portion of the turf collapsed under
      Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, causing him to slip and miss a field
      goal, although the field has not had any major issues since. As is customary
      for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums, the NFL re-sodded the
      hybrid Bermuda 419 turf playing surface prior to the game; NFL and Atlanta Braves
      field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in "great shape" for the
      game. However, the turf showed problems throughout the game, with a number of
      players needing to change their cleats during the game and players slipping
      during plays all throughout the game.  As the designated home team in the annual
      rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Broncos elected to wear their road white
      jerseys with matching white pants. Elway stated, "We''ve had Super Bowl success
      in our white uniforms." The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants
      in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII, Elway''s last game as Denver QB, when
      they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19. In their only other Super Bowl win
      in Super Bowl XXXII, Denver wore blue jerseys, which was their primary color
      at the time. They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys, but
      they are 0–4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys, losing in Super Bowl
      XII, XXII, XXIV, and XLVIII. The only other AFC champion team to have worn white
      as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers; they
      defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior. The Broncos''
      decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform:
      black jerseys with silver pants.  The Panthers used the San Jose State practice
      facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott. The Broncos practiced at Stanford
      University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott.  On June 4, 2014, the NFL
      announced that the game would be branded with Arabic numerals as "Super Bowl
      50"—rather than with Roman numerals, a practice established at Super Bowl V
      under which the game would have been known as "Super Bowl L". NFL creative director
      Shandon Melvin, explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty
      in designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter "L" using the standardized
      logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV. He noted that "L" was harder to
      design around as it is asymmetrical unlike other Roman numerals, and also showed
      concerns that use of the letter "L" could be interpreted as the "loser" hand
      gesture. 73 different mockups, incorporating either "L" or "50", were designed
      before the final design was chosen, which featured large numerals colored in
      gold behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead of underneath and in silver as
      in the standard logo.  Tying into the game''s "golden anniversary," various
      gold-themed promotions and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season.
      The league adopted a gold-tinted logo, which was implemented across all of the
      NFL''s properties and painted on fields during the season. The numbering of
      the 50-yard line on fields was colored gold, and beginning on week 7, all sideline
      jackets and hats featured gold-trimmed logos. Gold footballs were given to each
      high school that has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl, and "homecoming"
      events were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games.  Ten themed "50"
      statues were placed in locations across San Francisco to promote the game; however,
      due to the negativity towards the game by residents of the city, the statues
      notably became the target of vandals, with the "SUPER BOWL 50" lettering on
      their bases re-arranged to form other phrases such as "SUPERB OWL", "SUP BRO
      50", and after the Alamo Square statue was toppled, "OOPS".  The annual NFL
      Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. In addition, "Super
      Bowl City" opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero, featuring
      games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area''s technology, culinary
      creations, and cultural diversity. More than a million people are expected to
      attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week. San Francisco
      mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area "they
      are going to have to leave". San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully
      lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount
      of $5 million.  In addition, there are $2 million worth of other ancillary events,
      including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center, a beer, wine
      and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University, and a pep rally.
      A professional fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual
      donors, but still may need the city council to help fund the event. Additional
      funding will be provided by the city council, which has announced plans to set
      aside seed funding for the event.  The game''s media day, which was typically
      held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game, was moved to the Monday evening
      and re-branded as "Super Bowl Opening Night". The event was held on February
      1, 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose. Alongside the traditional media availabilities,
      the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica
      of the Golden Gate Bridge.  For the first time, the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee
      and the NFL have openly sought disabled veteran and lesbian, gay, bisexual and
      transgender-owned businesses in Business Connect, the Super Bowl program that
      provides local companies with contracting opportunities in and around the Super
      Bowl. The host committee has already raised over $40 million through sponsors
      including Apple, Google, Yahoo!, Intel, Gap, Chevron, and Dignity Health.  The
      Super Bowl 50 Host Committee has vowed to be "the most giving Super Bowl ever",
      and will dedicate 25 percent of all money it raises for philanthropic causes
      in the Bay Area. The committee created the 50 fund as its philanthropic initiative
      and focuses on providing grants to aid with youth development, community investment
      and sustainable environments.  In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that
      all Super Bowl champions receive, the winning team also received a large, 18-karat
      gold-plated "50". Each digit weighs for a total of . Like the Lombardi Trophy,
      the "50" was designed by Tiffany & Co.  After putting out a call for volunteers
      in June 2015, over 450 volunteers helped to make the Super Bowl 50 Tour happen.
      More than 5,000 volunteers were on hand to help with events leading up to, during
      and after Super Bowl 50 as well. Volunteers signed up for a minimum of 3–4 hour
      shifts, and some volunteers gave more than 200 hours of their time over the
      course of the week. As a thank you for volunteering, volunteers were gifted
      backpacks and uniforms.  In the United States, the game was televised by CBS,
      as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the
      NFL. The network''s lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the
      contest, with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines. CBS introduced
      new features during the telecast, including pylon cameras and microphones along
      with "EyeVision 360"—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be
      used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and "bullet time" effects. (An earlier
      version of "EyeVision" was last used in Super Bowl XXXV; for Super Bowl 50,
      the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution.) CBS provided digital streams of
      the game via CBSSports.com, and the CBS Sports apps on tablets, Windows 10,
      Xbox One and other digital media players (such as Chromecast and Roku). Due
      to Verizon Communications exclusivity, streaming on smartphones was only provided
      to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service.  On December 28, 2015,
      ESPN announced that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to provide
      a dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of Super Bowl 50, airing on ESPN Deportes
      and streaming on WatchESPN, featuring commentary and surrounding coverage in
      the language; unlike Fox and NBC, CBS does not have a Spanish-language cable
      network that could have carried such a broadcast. The production utilized CBS''s
      video, but with Spanish-language graphics provided by ESPN, and its "Monday
      Night Football" commentary crew of Alvaro Martin, Raul Allegre, and sideline
      reporter John Sutcliffe. ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game and post-game coverage,
      while Martin, Allegre, and Sutcliffe also contributed reports for the English-language
      ESPN as part of efforts to promote the simulcast. ESPN Deportes'' vice president
      of programming Freddy Rolon felt that dedicated Spanish-language coverage appealed
      better to Hispanic viewers than Spanish commentary on the SAP audio channel,
      going on to say that "I have family members who watch Spanish language television
      and they don''t know where that SAP button is to begin with".  As opposed to
      broadcasts of primetime series, CBS broadcast special episodes of its late-night
      talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50, beginning with a special
      episode of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" following the game. Following
      a break for late local programming, CBS also aired a special episode of "The
      Late Late Show with James Corden".  With an average TV audience of 111.9 million,
      the game was the third most-watched Super Bowl—and third most-watched U.S. program—in
      history, according to the Nielsen ratings. It was also the most-watched program
      of all-time in terms of total audience, 167-million, which measures those who
      viewed at least six minutes of the broadcast. Average viewership is the industry
      standard for determining television ratings, while total audience is a supplemental
      metric. The Spanish-language broadcast on ESPN Deportes was seen by an average
      of 472,000 viewers; it ranked behind Super Bowl XLVIII as the second-most-watched
      Spanish-language cable telecast in U.S. history, outside of soccer games.  CBS
      set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $5,000,000, a record high
      price for a Super Bowl ad. As of January 26, the advertisements had not yet
      sold out. CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time
      on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game, meaning that for
      the first time, digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising
      in pattern with the television broadcast. This would be the final year in a
      multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer
      to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount. It was also
      the final year that Doritos, a longtime sponsor of the game, held its "Crash
      the Super Bowl" contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads
      for a chance to have it aired during the game. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company
      also made their Super Bowl debut, Hyundai placed in both first and fifth place
      respectively on "USA Today"s Super Bowl Ad Meter survey, with their ads "First
      Date" (for the Hyundai Genesis) and "Ryanville" (for the 2017 Hyundai Elantra).  First-time
      advertisers at Super Bowl 50 included Amazon.com, Colgate toothpaste, Death
      Wish Coffee (who beat 10 other small businesses in a contest held by Intuit,
      who paid for the ad time as a prize), LG Electronics, Marmot, Nintendo (promoting
      the 20th anniversary of the "Pokémon" franchise), PayPal, and SoFi.  20th Century
      Fox, Lionsgate, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios and Walt Disney Studios
      paid for movie trailers to be aired during the Super Bowl. Fox paid for "Deadpool",
      "", "" and "Eddie the Eagle", Lionsgate paid for "Gods of Egypt", Paramount
      paid for "" and "10 Cloverfield Lane", Universal paid for "The Secret Life of
      Pets" and the debut trailer for "Jason Bourne" and Disney paid for "", "The
      Jungle Book" and "Alice Through the Looking Glass".  Westwood One carried the
      game throughout North America, with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer,
      Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts, and James Lofton and Mark Malone
      as sideline reporters. Jim Gray anchored the pre-game and halftime coverage.  The
      flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team carried their
      local play-by-play calls. In Denver, KOA (850 AM) and KRFX (103.5 FM) carried
      the game, with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary.
      In North Carolina, WBT (1110 AM) carried the game, with Mick Mixon on play-by-play
      and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary. WBT also simulcast the
      game on its sister station WBT-FM (99.3 FM), based in Chester, South Carolina.
      As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations, the local broadcasts were audible
      over much of the western United States after sunset (for Denver) and the eastern
      United States throughout the game (for Carolina). In accordance with contractual
      rules, the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks either
      carried the Westwood One feed or did not air the game at all.  In the United
      Kingdom, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra carried the contest. As in
      previous years, the BBC aired its own commercial-free British English broadcast,
      with Greg Brady, Darren Fletcher and Rocky Boiman on commentary.  In honor of
      the 50th Super Bowl, the pregame ceremony featured the on-field introduction
      of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players. Bart Starr (MVP of
      Super Bowls I and II) and Chuck Howley (MVP of Super Bowl V) appeared via video.
      The late Harvey Martin, co-MVP of Super Bowl XII who died in 2001, was acknowledged
      when the other co-MVP of Super Bowl XII, Randy White, was introduced. Peyton
      Manning (MVP of Super Bowl XLI and the Broncos'' starting quarterback for the
      game) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game. This ceremony continued
      a ten-year tradition (starting with Super Bowl XX and then repeated in Super
      Bowl XXX and Super Bowl XL) in which past Super Bowl MVPs were honored before
      the game.  Lady Gaga sang the national anthem, while Marlee Matlin simultaneously
      performed an American Sign Language (ASL) version of it. Matlin also signed
      an a cappella version of "America the Beautiful", which was sung by a U.S. Armed
      Forces chorus.  In late November 2015, reports surfaced stating that "multiple
      acts" would perform during the halftime show. On December 3, the league confirmed
      that the show would be headlined by the British rock band Coldplay. On January
      7, 2016, Pepsi confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé, who headlined
      the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single
      "Hymn for the Weekend" (which was removed from the setlist before the game),
      would be making an appearance. Bruno Mars, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII
      halftime show, and Mark Ronson (Mars''s collaborator on "Uptown Funk") also
      performed.  Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong. Peyton Manning
      completed an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver
      Andre Caldwell. A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards
      to the Panthers 14-yard line, but Carolina''s defense dug in over the next three
      plays. First, linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss.
      Then after an incompletion, Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain
      on third down, forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus
      34-yard field goal. The score marked the first time in the entire postseason
      that Carolina was facing a deficit. After each team punted, Panthers quarterback
      Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass to Jerricho Cotchery, but the
      call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge. CBS analyst
      and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the
      review clearly showed the pass was complete. Two plays later, on 3rd-and-10
      from the 15-yard line, linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton''s
      hands while sacking him, and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for
      a Broncos touchdown, giving the team a 10–0 lead. This was the first fumble
      return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993
      season.  After a punt from both teams, Carolina got on track with a 9-play,
      73-yard scoring drive. Newton completed all four of his pass attempts for 51
      yards and rushed twice for 25 yards, while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive
      with a 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the
      second quarter. Later on, Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman''s
      short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players, but none of them attempted
      to make a tackle, apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch. Norwood
      had not done so, and with no resistance around him, he took off for a Super
      Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers
      14-yard line. Despite Denver''s excellent field position, they could not get
      the ball into the end zone, so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased
      their lead to 13–7.  On Carolina''s next possession, fullback Mike Tolbert lost
      a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart, which linebacker Danny
      Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line. However, the Panthers soon
      took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself
      and then intercepted it, returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard
      line with 1:55 left on the clock. The Panthers could not gain any yards with
      their possession and had to punt. After a Denver punt, Carolina drove to the
      Broncos 45-yard line. But with 11 seconds left and no timeouts left, Newton
      was sacked by DeMarcus Ware causing time for the half to expire.  The Panthers
      seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton
      completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their
      second offensive play. But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard
      line, and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard
      field goal attempt. After the miss, Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel
      Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards, setting up McManus'' 33-yard field goal
      that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead. Carolina got off to another strong start
      after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown. But
      once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced
      off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J. Ward. Ward fumbled
      the ball deep in Denver territory during the return, but Trevathan was able
      to recover the ball enabling Denver to keep possession. There would be no more
      scoring in the third quarter, but early in the fourth, the Broncos drove to
      the Panthers 41-yard line. On the next play, Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning''s
      hand as he was winding up for a pass, and then recovered it for Carolina on
      the 50-yard line. A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by
      Stewart then set up Gano''s 39-yard field goal, cutting the Panthers deficit
      to one score at 16–10. The next three drives of the game would end in punts.  With
      4:51 left in regulation, Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with
      a chance to mount a game-winning drive, and soon faced 3rd-and-9. On the next
      play, Miller stripped the ball away from Newton, and after several players dove
      for it, it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward, who returned
      it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line. Newton was the third player to attempt
      a recovery (following Ware and Mike Remmers) of the ball and while various angles
      appeared to show that he had a decent probability of recovery if he''d dived
      in his attempt, Newton instead hesitated and then tried to drop on top of the
      ball, which failed. This split second decision later earned him criticism. Meanwhile,
      Denver''s offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays, but a holding
      penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs. Then
      Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie
      Fowler for a 2-point conversion, giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and
      essentially putting the game away. Carolina had two more drives and managed
      one first down between them before the game ended.  Manning finished the game
      13 of 23 for 141 yards with one interception, two fumbles, and was sacked 5
      times. Sanders was his top receiver with six receptions for 83 yards. Anderson
      was the game''s leading rusher with 90 yards and a touchdown, along with four
      receptions for 10 yards. Miller had six total tackles (five solo), 2½ sacks,
      and two forced fumbles. Ware had five total tackles and two sacks. Ward had
      seven total tackles, a fumble recovery, and an interception. McManus made all
      four of his field goals, making him perfect on all 11 attempts during the post-season.  Newton
      completed 18 of 41 passes for 265 yards with one interception, two fumbles,
      and was sacked 6 times. He was also his team''s leading rusher with 45 yards
      on six carries. Brown caught four passes for 80 yards, while Ginn had four receptions
      for 74 yards. Ginn was sacked once on a trick play. Ealy was the top defensive
      performer for Carolina with four total tackles, three sacks, a forced fumble,
      a fumble recovery, and an interception. Defensive end Charles Johnson had four
      total tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble. Linebacker Luke Kuechly had 11 total
      tackles and a sack, while Thomas Davis had seven total tackles, despite playing
      just two weeks after breaking his right arm in the NFC title game.  Super Bowl
      50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams. Denver won despite
      being massively outgained in total yards (315 to 194) and first downs (21 to
      11). Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by
      a Super Bowl winning team, as the previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore
      Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. Only seven other teams had ever gained fewer than
      200 yards in a Super Bowl, and all of them had lost. This was the first Super
      Bowl since Super Bowl XXXVI that the winning team scored only a single offensive
      touchdown, although the Broncos defense had earlier in the game scored a touchdown
      from a fumble recovery in the end zone. The Broncos'' seven sacks tied a Super
      Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. Manning was sacked five
      times by the Panthers, giving this game highest total (12) of combined sacks
      in Super Bowl history. Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks,
      and is the only such player to do so and record an interception. Jordan Norwood''s
      61-yard punt return set a new record, surpassing the old record of 45 yards
      set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII. Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down,
      while Carolina was 3-of-15. The two teams'' combined third down conversion percentage
      of 13.8 was the lowest in Super Bowl history. Manning and Newton had quarterback
      passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4, respectively, and their added total of 112
      is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl. Manning became
      the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39, the first quarterback
      ever to win a Super Bowl starting for two different teams, and the first quarterback
      ever to win 200 games (regular season and postseason) as a starter. Gary Kubiak
      became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went
      to the Super Bowl with as a player.  Manning announced his retirement from the
      NFL a month after the Super Bowl. This was also the final game in the career
      of Panthers defensive lineman Jared Allen, who retired as the NFL''s ninth all-time
      leader in sacks.  Completions/attempts<br>Carries<br>Long gain<br>Receptions  Super

    context: ' Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion
      of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season. The American Football
      Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference
      (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to win their third Super Bowl championship.
      The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi''s Stadium in Santa Clara,
      California (located in the San Francisco Bay Area). As this was the 50th Super
      Bowl, the league emphasized the "golden anniversary" with various gold-themed
      initiatives during the 2015 season, as well as suspending the tradition of naming
      each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been
      known as "Super Bowl L"), so the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals
      50.  The Panthers finished the regular season with a 15–1 record, racking up
      the league''s top offense, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most
      Valuable Player (MVP). They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49–15 in the NFC
      Championship Game and advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance since the
      franchise was founded in 1995. The Broncos finished the regular season with
      a 12–4 record, thanks to having the league''s top defense, and despite the struggles
      of starting quarterback Peyton Manning; they defeated the defending Super Bowl
      champion New England Patriots 20–18 in the AFC Championship Game. They joined
      the Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, and Pittsburgh Steelers as one of four teams that
      have made eight appearances in the Super Bowl.  In one of the most defensive
      Super Bowl matchups in NFL history, the Broncos took an early lead in Super
      Bowl 50 and never trailed. Denver recorded seven sacks and forced three turnovers.
      Carolina likewise kept pace by recording five sacks and forcing two turnovers.
      Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super Bowl MVP. This game was also the
      final game of Peyton Manning''s career; he announced his retirement on March
      7, 2016.  CBS'' broadcast of the game was the third most-watched program in
      American television history with an average of 111.9 million viewers. The network
      charged an average of $5 million for a 30-second commercial during the game.
      The Super Bowl 50 halftime show was headlined by Coldplay, with special guest
      performers Beyoncé and Bruno Mars.  In early 2012, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell
      stated that the league planned to make the 50th Super Bowl "spectacular" and
      that it would be "an important game for us as a league".  Cities included in
      early discussions or that submitted bids included:   The league eventually narrowed
      the bids to three sites: New Orleans'' Mercedes-Benz Superdome, Miami''s Sun
      Life Stadium, and the San Francisco Bay Area''s Levi''s Stadium.  The league
      announced on October 16, 2012, that the two finalists were Sun Life Stadium
      and Levi''s Stadium. The South Florida/Miami area has previously hosted the
      event 10 times (tied for most with New Orleans), with the most recent one being
      Super Bowl XLIV in 2010. The San Francisco Bay Area last hosted in 1985 (Super
      Bowl XIX), held at Stanford Stadium in Stanford, California, won by the home
      team 49ers. The Miami bid depended on whether the stadium underwent renovations.
      However, on May 3, 2013, the Florida legislature refused to approve the funding
      plan to pay for the renovations, dealing a significant blow to Miami''s chances.  On
      May 21, 2013, NFL owners at their spring meetings in Boston voted and awarded
      the game to Levi''s Stadium. The $1.2 billion stadium opened in 2014. It is
      the first Super Bowl held in the San Francisco Bay Area since Super Bowl XIX
      in 1985, and the first in California since Super Bowl XXXVII took place in San
      Diego in 2003.  For the third straight season, the number one seeds in the NFC
      and AFC, the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos, met in the Super Bowl. The
      game also featured the league''s top scoring offense (Panthers) against the
      league''s top defense (Broncos). The Panthers became the 10th team since 1960
      to have lost just one game during the regular season, and the sixth team ever
      to have a 15–1 record. It was their second Super Bowl appearance; the other
      was Super Bowl XXXVIII. The Broncos became the fourth team to have eight Super
      Bowl appearances. It was their second appearance in three years, having also
      reached Super Bowl XLVIII. Coincidentally, John Fox was the head coach of each
      team in their previous Super Bowl appearance.  Despite waiving long-time running
      back DeAngelo Williams and losing top wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn
      ACL in the preseason, the Carolina Panthers had their best regular season in
      franchise history, becoming the seventh team to win at least 15 regular season
      games since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in . Carolina started
      the season 14–0, not only setting franchise records for the best start and the
      longest single-season winning streak, but also posting the best start to a season
      by an NFC team in NFL history, breaking the 13–0 record previously shared with
      the 2009 New Orleans Saints and the 2011 Green Bay Packers. With their NFC-best
      15–1 regular season record, the Panthers clinched home-field advantage throughout
      the NFC playoffs for the first time in franchise history. Ten players were selected
      to the Pro Bowl (the most in franchise history) along with eight All-Pro selections.  The
      Panthers'' offense, which led the NFL in scoring (500 points), was loaded with
      talent, boasting six Pro Bowl selections. Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton had
      one of his best seasons, throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 yards,
      while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns (35 passing,
      10 rushing), a career-low 10 interceptions, and a career-best quarterback rating
      of 99.4. Newton''s leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen, who caught a
      career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns, and wide receiver
      Ted Ginn Jr., who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns; Ginn also
      rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards. Other key receivers
      included veteran Jerricho Cotchery (39 receptions for 485 yards), rookie Devin
      Funchess (31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns), and second-year
      receiver Corey Brown (31 receptions for 447 yards). The Panthers'' backfield
      featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart, who led the team with 989 rushing
      yards and six touchdowns in 13 games, along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert,
      who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards. Carolina''s
      offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections: center Ryan Kalil and
      guard Trai Turner.  The Panthers'' defense gave up just 308 points, ranking
      sixth in the league, while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and
      boasting four Pro Bowl selections. Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led
      the team in sacks with 11, while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two.
      Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6½ sacks. The Panthers defensive line also
      featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen, a 5-time Pro Bowl selection, who
      was the NFL''s active career sack leader with 136, along with defensive end
      Kony Ealy, who had five sacks in just nine starts. Behind them, two of the Panthers''
      three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl: Thomas
      Davis and Luke Kuechly. Davis compiled 5½ sacks, four forced fumbles, and four
      interceptions, while Kuechly led the team in tackles (118) forced two fumbles,
      and intercepted four passes of his own. Carolina''s secondary featured Pro Bowl
      safety Kurt Coleman, who led the team with a career high seven interceptions,
      while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman, who developed
      into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions, two of
      which were returned for touchdowns.  After losing in the divisional round of
      the playoffs during three of the previous four seasons, the Denver Broncos''
      general manager John Elway made numerous coaching changes, including a mutual
      parting with head coach John Fox, who had won four divisional championships
      in his four years as Broncos head coach, being replaced in that role by Gary
      Kubiak, Elway''s former backup quarterback and former Broncos offensive coordinator.
      Wade Phillips, a former Broncos head coach, returned to the team to serve his
      second stint as defensive coordinator, succeeding Jack Del Rio who had left
      to take the head coaching vacancy at the Oakland Raiders. The team''s 43–8 loss
      in Super Bowl XLVIII two years earlier, despite holding the regular season''s
      top offense, resulted in Elway signing defensive end DeMarcus Ware, cornerback
      Aqib Talib, safety T. J. Ward, and wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders for the 2014
      season.  Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense
      with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning''s shotgun passing
      style, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line,
      as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year
      with the Indianapolis Colts in , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel
      that he had suffered since the summer. In addition, Manning was getting old,
      as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Though the team had a 7–0 start, Manning
      led the NFL in interceptions. In Week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of
      the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL''s all-time record for
      career passing yards in this game, but after throwing four interceptions, he
      was benched in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as
      the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. After a slow start
      in Denver''s final regular season game against San Diego, Osweiler was benched
      leading to Manning''s return. Manning re-claimed the starting quarterback position
      for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team
      to clinch the AFC''s No. 1 seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips,
      who replaced his predecessor''s complicated read-and-react scheme with a simple
      aggressive approach of attacking the ball, the Broncos'' defense ranked No.
      1 in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous
      three seasons, the team continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise
      records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense,
      the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field
      advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.  Manning finished the year with a career-low
      67.9 passer rating, throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns, with 17 interceptions.
      In contrast, Osweiler threw for 1,967 yards, 10 touchdowns and six interceptions
      for a rating of 86.4. Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105
      receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns, while Emmanuel Sanders caught
      76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores, while adding another 106 yards returning
      punts. Tight end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with
      46 receptions for 517 yards. Running back C. J. Anderson was the team''s leading
      rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns, while also catching 25 passes for 183
      yards. Running back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards, five
      touchdowns, 24 receptions, and a 4.2 yards per carry average. Overall, the offense
      ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections.  The
      Broncos'' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed (4,530) for the first
      time in franchise history, and fourth in points allowed (296). Defensive ends
      Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson each had 5½ sacks. Pro Bowl linebacker Von Miller
      led the team with 11 sacks, forced four fumbles, and recovered three. Linebacker
      DeMarcus Ware was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the ninth time in his
      career, ranking second on the team with 7½ sacks. Linebacker Brandon Marshall
      led the team in total tackles with 109, while Danny Trevathan ranked second
      with 102 tackles. Cornerbacks Aqib Talib (three interceptions) and Chris Harris
      Jr. (two interceptions) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the defense,
      though none of the players selected for the Pro Bowl participated due to the
      Broncos reaching Super Bowl 50.  The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the
      divisional round, running up a 31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious
      second half comeback attempt to win 31–24, avenging their elimination from a
      year earlier. The Panthers then blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship
      Game, 49–15, racking up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers.  The Broncos
      defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round, 23–16, by scoring
      11 points in the final three minutes of the game. They then defeated the defending
      Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game,
      20–18, by intercepting a pass on New England''s 2-point conversion attempt with
      17 seconds left on the clock and recovering a subsequent onside kick attempt.  Carolina
      suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis, an 11-year veteran who had already
      overcome three ACL tears in his career, went down with a broken arm in the NFC
      Championship Game. Despite this, he insisted he would still find a way to play
      in the Super Bowl. His prediction turned out to be accurate and he made it into
      the starting lineup.  Peyton Manning reached his fourth Super Bowl, with appearances
      under as many head coaches (Tony Dungy, Jim Caldwell, John Fox and Gary Kubiak).
      He became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple
      Super Bowls. He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl
      at age 39. The past record was held by John Elway, who led the Broncos to victory
      in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver''s Executive Vice President
      of Football Operations and General Manager.  Manning and Newton set the record
      for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13
      years and 48 days (Manning was 39, Newton was 26). In addition, this was the
      first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the #1 pick
      in their draft classes. Manning was the #1 selection of the 1998 NFL Draft,
      while Newton was picked first in 2011. The matchup also pits the top two picks
      of the 2011 draft against each other: Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for
      Denver.  With Ron Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in
      Super Bowl XX, and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos'' defeats
      in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV, this was the first Super Bowl in which both head
      coaches played in the game themselves; coincidentally, the coaches they had
      played under, Mike Ditka (Rivera) and Dan Reeves (Kubiak), not only had Super
      Bowl playing experience themselves, but had done so as teammates with the Dallas
      Cowboys in Super Bowls V and VI (and worked together as Cowboys assistant coaches
      for Super Bowls X, XII and XIII).  Concerns were raised over whether Levi''s
      Stadium''s field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl; during the
      inaugural season, the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various
      issues, and earlier in the 2015 season, a portion of the turf collapsed under
      Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, causing him to slip and miss a field
      goal, although the field has not had any major issues since. As is customary
      for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums, the NFL re-sodded the
      hybrid Bermuda 419 turf playing surface prior to the game; NFL and Atlanta Braves
      field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in "great shape" for the
      game. However, the turf showed problems throughout the game, with a number of
      players needing to change their cleats during the game and players slipping
      during plays all throughout the game.  As the designated home team in the annual
      rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Broncos elected to wear their road white
      jerseys with matching white pants. Elway stated, "We''ve had Super Bowl success
      in our white uniforms." The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants
      in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII, Elway''s last game as Denver QB, when
      they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19. In their only other Super Bowl win
      in Super Bowl XXXII, Denver wore blue jerseys, which was their primary color
      at the time. They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys, but
      they are 0–4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys, losing in Super Bowl
      XII, XXII, XXIV, and XLVIII. The only other AFC champion team to have worn white
      as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers; they
      defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior. The Broncos''
      decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform:
      black jerseys with silver pants.  The Panthers used the San Jose State practice
      facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott. The Broncos practiced at Stanford
      University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott.  On June 4, 2014, the NFL
      announced that the game would be branded with Arabic numerals as "Super Bowl
      50"—rather than with Roman numerals, a practice established at Super Bowl V
      under which the game would have been known as "Super Bowl L". NFL creative director
      Shandon Melvin, explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty
      in designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter "L" using the standardized
      logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV. He noted that "L" was harder to
      design around as it is asymmetrical unlike other Roman numerals, and also showed
      concerns that use of the letter "L" could be interpreted as the "loser" hand
      gesture. 73 different mockups, incorporating either "L" or "50", were designed
      before the final design was chosen, which featured large numerals colored in
      gold behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead of underneath and in silver as
      in the standard logo.  Tying into the game''s "golden anniversary," various
      gold-themed promotions and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season.
      The league adopted a gold-tinted logo, which was implemented across all of the
      NFL''s properties and painted on fields during the season. The numbering of
      the 50-yard line on fields was colored gold, and beginning on week 7, all sideline
      jackets and hats featured gold-trimmed logos. Gold footballs were given to each
      high school that has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl, and "homecoming"
      events were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games.  Ten themed "50"
      statues were placed in locations across San Francisco to promote the game; however,
      due to the negativity towards the game by residents of the city, the statues
      notably became the target of vandals, with the "SUPER BOWL 50" lettering on
      their bases re-arranged to form other phrases such as "SUPERB OWL", "SUP BRO
      50", and after the Alamo Square statue was toppled, "OOPS".  The annual NFL
      Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. In addition, "Super
      Bowl City" opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero, featuring
      games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area''s technology, culinary
      creations, and cultural diversity. More than a million people are expected to
      attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week. San Francisco
      mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area "they
      are going to have to leave". San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully
      lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount
      of $5 million.  In addition, there are $2 million worth of other ancillary events,
      including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center, a beer, wine
      and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University, and a pep rally.
      A professional fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual
      donors, but still may need the city council to help fund the event. Additional
      funding will be provided by the city council, which has announced plans to set
      aside seed funding for the event.  The game''s media day, which was typically
      held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game, was moved to the Monday evening
      and re-branded as "Super Bowl Opening Night". The event was held on February
      1, 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose. Alongside the traditional media availabilities,
      the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica
      of the Golden Gate Bridge.  For the first time, the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee
      and the NFL have openly sought disabled veteran and lesbian, gay, bisexual and
      transgender-owned businesses in Business Connect, the Super Bowl program that
      provides local companies with contracting opportunities in and around the Super
      Bowl. The host committee has already raised over $40 million through sponsors
      including Apple, Google, Yahoo!, Intel, Gap, Chevron, and Dignity Health.  The
      Super Bowl 50 Host Committee has vowed to be "the most giving Super Bowl ever",
      and will dedicate 25 percent of all money it raises for philanthropic causes
      in the Bay Area. The committee created the 50 fund as its philanthropic initiative
      and focuses on providing grants to aid with youth development, community investment
      and sustainable environments.  In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that
      all Super Bowl champions receive, the winning team also received a large, 18-karat
      gold-plated "50". Each digit weighs for a total of . Like the Lombardi Trophy,
      the "50" was designed by Tiffany & Co.  After putting out a call for volunteers
      in June 2015, over 450 volunteers helped to make the Super Bowl 50 Tour happen.
      More than 5,000 volunteers were on hand to help with events leading up to, during
      and after Super Bowl 50 as well. Volunteers signed up for a minimum of 3–4 hour
      shifts, and some volunteers gave more than 200 hours of their time over the
      course of the week. As a thank you for volunteering, volunteers were gifted
      backpacks and uniforms.  In the United States, the game was televised by CBS,
      as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the
      NFL. The network''s lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the
      contest, with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines. CBS introduced
      new features during the telecast, including pylon cameras and microphones along
      with "EyeVision 360"—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be
      used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and "bullet time" effects. (An earlier
      version of "EyeVision" was last used in Super Bowl XXXV; for Super Bowl 50,
      the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution.) CBS provided digital streams of
      the game via CBSSports.com, and the CBS Sports apps on tablets, Windows 10,
      Xbox One and other digital media players (such as Chromecast and Roku). Due
      to Verizon Communications exclusivity, streaming on smartphones was only provided
      to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service.  On December 28, 2015,
      ESPN announced that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to provide
      a dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of Super Bowl 50, airing on ESPN Deportes
      and streaming on WatchESPN, featuring commentary and surrounding coverage in
      the language; unlike Fox and NBC, CBS does not have a Spanish-language cable
      network that could have carried such a broadcast. The production utilized CBS''s
      video, but with Spanish-language graphics provided by ESPN, and its "Monday
      Night Football" commentary crew of Alvaro Martin, Raul Allegre, and sideline
      reporter John Sutcliffe. ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game and post-game coverage,
      while Martin, Allegre, and Sutcliffe also contributed reports for the English-language
      ESPN as part of efforts to promote the simulcast. ESPN Deportes'' vice president
      of programming Freddy Rolon felt that dedicated Spanish-language coverage appealed
      better to Hispanic viewers than Spanish commentary on the SAP audio channel,
      going on to say that "I have family members who watch Spanish language television
      and they don''t know where that SAP button is to begin with".  As opposed to
      broadcasts of primetime series, CBS broadcast special episodes of its late-night
      talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50, beginning with a special
      episode of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" following the game. Following
      a break for late local programming, CBS also aired a special episode of "The
      Late Late Show with James Corden".  With an average TV audience of 111.9 million,
      the game was the third most-watched Super Bowl—and third most-watched U.S. program—in
      history, according to the Nielsen ratings. It was also the most-watched program
      of all-time in terms of total audience, 167-million, which measures those who
      viewed at least six minutes of the broadcast. Average viewership is the industry
      standard for determining television ratings, while total audience is a supplemental
      metric. The Spanish-language broadcast on ESPN Deportes was seen by an average
      of 472,000 viewers; it ranked behind Super Bowl XLVIII as the second-most-watched
      Spanish-language cable telecast in U.S. history, outside of soccer games.  CBS
      set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $5,000,000, a record high
      price for a Super Bowl ad. As of January 26, the advertisements had not yet
      sold out. CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time
      on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game, meaning that for
      the first time, digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising
      in pattern with the television broadcast. This would be the final year in a
      multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer
      to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount. It was also
      the final year that Doritos, a longtime sponsor of the game, held its "Crash
      the Super Bowl" contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads
      for a chance to have it aired during the game. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company
      also made their Super Bowl debut, Hyundai placed in both first and fifth place
      respectively on "USA Today"s Super Bowl Ad Meter survey, with their ads "First
      Date" (for the Hyundai Genesis) and "Ryanville" (for the 2017 Hyundai Elantra).  First-time
      advertisers at Super Bowl 50 included Amazon.com, Colgate toothpaste, Death
      Wish Coffee (who beat 10 other small businesses in a contest held by Intuit,
      who paid for the ad time as a prize), LG Electronics, Marmot, Nintendo (promoting
      the 20th anniversary of the "Pokémon" franchise), PayPal, and SoFi.  20th Century
      Fox, Lionsgate, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios and Walt Disney Studios
      paid for movie trailers to be aired during the Super Bowl. Fox paid for "Deadpool",
      "", "" and "Eddie the Eagle", Lionsgate paid for "Gods of Egypt", Paramount
      paid for "" and "10 Cloverfield Lane", Universal paid for "The Secret Life of
      Pets" and the debut trailer for "Jason Bourne" and Disney paid for "", "The
      Jungle Book" and "Alice Through the Looking Glass".  Westwood One carried the
      game throughout North America, with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer,
      Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts, and James Lofton and Mark Malone
      as sideline reporters. Jim Gray anchored the pre-game and halftime coverage.  The
      flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team carried their
      local play-by-play calls. In Denver, KOA (850 AM) and KRFX (103.5 FM) carried
      the game, with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary.
      In North Carolina, WBT (1110 AM) carried the game, with Mick Mixon on play-by-play
      and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary. WBT also simulcast the
      game on its sister station WBT-FM (99.3 FM), based in Chester, South Carolina.
      As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations, the local broadcasts were audible
      over much of the western United States after sunset (for Denver) and the eastern
      United States throughout the game (for Carolina). In accordance with contractual
      rules, the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks either
      carried the Westwood One feed or did not air the game at all.  In the United
      Kingdom, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra carried the contest. As in
      previous years, the BBC aired its own commercial-free British English broadcast,
      with Greg Brady, Darren Fletcher and Rocky Boiman on commentary.  In honor of
      the 50th Super Bowl, the pregame ceremony featured the on-field introduction
      of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players. Bart Starr (MVP of
      Super Bowls I and II) and Chuck Howley (MVP of Super Bowl V) appeared via video.
      The late Harvey Martin, co-MVP of Super Bowl XII who died in 2001, was acknowledged
      when the other co-MVP of Super Bowl XII, Randy White, was introduced. Peyton
      Manning (MVP of Super Bowl XLI and the Broncos'' starting quarterback for the
      game) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game. This ceremony continued
      a ten-year tradition (starting with Super Bowl XX and then repeated in Super
      Bowl XXX and Super Bowl XL) in which past Super Bowl MVPs were honored before
      the game.  Lady Gaga sang the national anthem, while Marlee Matlin simultaneously
      performed an American Sign Language (ASL) version of it. Matlin also signed
      an a cappella version of "America the Beautiful", which was sung by a U.S. Armed
      Forces chorus.  In late November 2015, reports surfaced stating that "multiple
      acts" would perform during the halftime show. On December 3, the league confirmed
      that the show would be headlined by the British rock band Coldplay. On January
      7, 2016, Pepsi confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé, who headlined
      the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single
      "Hymn for the Weekend" (which was removed from the setlist before the game),
      would be making an appearance. Bruno Mars, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII
      halftime show, and Mark Ronson (Mars''s collaborator on "Uptown Funk") also
      performed.  Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong. Peyton Manning
      completed an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver
      Andre Caldwell. A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards
      to the Panthers 14-yard line, but Carolina''s defense dug in over the next three
      plays. First, linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss.
      Then after an incompletion, Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain
      on third down, forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus
      34-yard field goal. The score marked the first time in the entire postseason
      that Carolina was facing a deficit. After each team punted, Panthers quarterback
      Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass to Jerricho Cotchery, but the
      call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge. CBS analyst
      and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the
      review clearly showed the pass was complete. Two plays later, on 3rd-and-10
      from the 15-yard line, linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton''s
      hands while sacking him, and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for
      a Broncos touchdown, giving the team a 10–0 lead. This was the first fumble
      return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993
      season.  After a punt from both teams, Carolina got on track with a 9-play,
      73-yard scoring drive. Newton completed all four of his pass attempts for 51
      yards and rushed twice for 25 yards, while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive
      with a 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the
      second quarter. Later on, Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman''s
      short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players, but none of them attempted
      to make a tackle, apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch. Norwood
      had not done so, and with no resistance around him, he took off for a Super
      Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers
      14-yard line. Despite Denver''s excellent field position, they could not get
      the ball into the end zone, so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased
      their lead to 13–7.  On Carolina''s next possession, fullback Mike Tolbert lost
      a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart, which linebacker Danny
      Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line. However, the Panthers soon
      took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself
      and then intercepted it, returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard
      line with 1:55 left on the clock. The Panthers could not gain any yards with
      their possession and had to punt. After a Denver punt, Carolina drove to the
      Broncos 45-yard line. But with 11 seconds left and no timeouts left, Newton
      was sacked by DeMarcus Ware causing time for the half to expire.  The Panthers
      seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton
      completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their
      second offensive play. But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard
      line, and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard
      field goal attempt. After the miss, Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel
      Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards, setting up McManus'' 33-yard field goal
      that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead. Carolina got off to another strong start
      after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown. But
      once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced
      off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J. Ward. Ward fumbled
      the ball deep in Denver territory during the return, but Trevathan was able
      to recover the ball enabling Denver to keep possession. There would be no more
      scoring in the third quarter, but early in the fourth, the Broncos drove to
      the Panthers 41-yard line. On the next play, Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning''s
      hand as he was winding up for a pass, and then recovered it for Carolina on
      the 50-yard line. A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by
      Stewart then set up Gano''s 39-yard field goal, cutting the Panthers deficit
      to one score at 16–10. The next three drives of the game would end in punts.  With
      4:51 left in regulation, Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with
      a chance to mount a game-winning drive, and soon faced 3rd-and-9. On the next
      play, Miller stripped the ball away from Newton, and after several players dove
      for it, it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward, who returned
      it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line. Newton was the third player to attempt
      a recovery (following Ware and Mike Remmers) of the ball and while various angles
      appeared to show that he had a decent probability of recovery if he''d dived
      in his attempt, Newton instead hesitated and then tried to drop on top of the
      ball, which failed. This split second decision later earned him criticism. Meanwhile,
      Denver''s offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays, but a holding
      penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs. Then
      Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie
      Fowler for a 2-point conversion, giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and
      essentially putting the game away. Carolina had two more drives and managed
      one first down between them before the game ended.  Manning finished the game
      13 of 23 for 141 yards with one interception, two fumbles, and was sacked 5
      times. Sanders was his top receiver with six receptions for 83 yards. Anderson
      was the game''s leading rusher with 90 yards and a touchdown, along with four
      receptions for 10 yards. Miller had six total tackles (five solo), 2½ sacks,
      and two forced fumbles. Ware had five total tackles and two sacks. Ward had
      seven total tackles, a fumble recovery, and an interception. McManus made all
      four of his field goals, making him perfect on all 11 attempts during the post-season.  Newton
      completed 18 of 41 passes for 265 yards with one interception, two fumbles,
      and was sacked 6 times. He was also his team''s leading rusher with 45 yards
      on six carries. Brown caught four passes for 80 yards, while Ginn had four receptions
      for 74 yards. Ginn was sacked once on a trick play. Ealy was the top defensive
      performer for Carolina with four total tackles, three sacks, a forced fumble,
      a fumble recovery, and an interception. Defensive end Charles Johnson had four
      total tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble. Linebacker Luke Kuechly had 11 total
      tackles and a sack, while Thomas Davis had seven total tackles, despite playing
      just two weeks after breaking his right arm in the NFC title game.  Super Bowl
      50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams. Denver won despite
      being massively outgained in total yards (315 to 194) and first downs (21 to
      11). Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by
      a Super Bowl winning team, as the previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore
      Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. Only seven other teams had ever gained fewer than
      200 yards in a Super Bowl, and all of them had lost. This was the first Super
      Bowl since Super Bowl XXXVI that the winning team scored only a single offensive
      touchdown, although the Broncos defense had earlier in the game scored a touchdown
      from a fumble recovery in the end zone. The Broncos'' seven sacks tied a Super
      Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. Manning was sacked five
      times by the Panthers, giving this game highest total (12) of combined sacks
      in Super Bowl history. Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks,
      and is the only such player to do so and record an interception. Jordan Norwood''s
      61-yard punt return set a new record, surpassing the old record of 45 yards
      set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII. Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down,
      while Carolina was 3-of-15. The two teams'' combined third down conversion percentage
      of 13.8 was the lowest in Super Bowl history. Manning and Newton had quarterback
      passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4, respectively, and their added total of 112
      is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl. Manning became
      the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39, the first quarterback
      ever to win a Super Bowl starting for two different teams, and the first quarterback
      ever to win 200 games (regular season and postseason) as a starter. Gary Kubiak
      became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went
      to the Super Bowl with as a player.  Manning announced his retirement from the
      NFL a month after the Super Bowl. This was also the final game in the career
      of Panthers defensive lineman Jared Allen, who retired as the NFL''s ninth all-time

    context: ' Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion
      of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season. The American Football
      Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference
      (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to win their third Super Bowl championship.
      The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi''s Stadium in Santa Clara,
      California (located in the San Francisco Bay Area). As this was the 50th Super
      Bowl, the league emphasized the "golden anniversary" with various gold-themed
      initiatives during the 2015 season, as well as suspending the tradition of naming
      each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been
      known as "Super Bowl L"), so the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals
      50.  The Panthers finished the regular season with a 15–1 record, racking up
      the league''s top offense, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most
      Valuable Player (MVP). They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49–15 in the NFC
      Championship Game and advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance since the
      franchise was founded in 1995. The Broncos finished the regular season with
      a 12–4 record, thanks to having the league''s top defense, and despite the struggles
      of starting quarterback Peyton Manning; they defeated the defending Super Bowl
      champion New England Patriots 20–18 in the AFC Championship Game. They joined
      the Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, and Pittsburgh Steelers as one of four teams that
      have made eight appearances in the Super Bowl.  In one of the most defensive
      Super Bowl matchups in NFL history, the Broncos took an early lead in Super
      Bowl 50 and never trailed. Denver recorded seven sacks and forced three turnovers.
      Carolina likewise kept pace by recording five sacks and forcing two turnovers.
      Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super Bowl MVP. This game was also the
      final game of Peyton Manning''s career; he announced his retirement on March
      7, 2016.  CBS'' broadcast of the game was the third most-watched program in
      American television history with an average of 111.9 million viewers. The network
      charged an average of $5 million for a 30-second commercial during the game.
      The Super Bowl 50 halftime show was headlined by Coldplay, with special guest
      performers Beyoncé and Bruno Mars.  In early 2012, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell
      stated that the league planned to make the 50th Super Bowl "spectacular" and
      that it would be "an important game for us as a league".  Cities included in
      early discussions or that submitted bids included:   The league eventually narrowed
      the bids to three sites: New Orleans'' Mercedes-Benz Superdome, Miami''s Sun
      Life Stadium, and the San Francisco Bay Area''s Levi''s Stadium.  The league
      announced on October 16, 2012, that the two finalists were Sun Life Stadium
      and Levi''s Stadium. The South Florida/Miami area has previously hosted the
      event 10 times (tied for most with New Orleans), with the most recent one being
      Super Bowl XLIV in 2010. The San Francisco Bay Area last hosted in 1985 (Super
      Bowl XIX), held at Stanford Stadium in Stanford, California, won by the home
      team 49ers. The Miami bid depended on whether the stadium underwent renovations.
      However, on May 3, 2013, the Florida legislature refused to approve the funding
      plan to pay for the renovations, dealing a significant blow to Miami''s chances.  On
      May 21, 2013, NFL owners at their spring meetings in Boston voted and awarded
      the game to Levi''s Stadium. The $1.2 billion stadium opened in 2014. It is
      the first Super Bowl held in the San Francisco Bay Area since Super Bowl XIX
      in 1985, and the first in California since Super Bowl XXXVII took place in San
      Diego in 2003.  For the third straight season, the number one seeds in the NFC
      and AFC, the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos, met in the Super Bowl. The
      game also featured the league''s top scoring offense (Panthers) against the
      league''s top defense (Broncos). The Panthers became the 10th team since 1960
      to have lost just one game during the regular season, and the sixth team ever
      to have a 15–1 record. It was their second Super Bowl appearance; the other
      was Super Bowl XXXVIII. The Broncos became the fourth team to have eight Super
      Bowl appearances. It was their second appearance in three years, having also
      reached Super Bowl XLVIII. Coincidentally, John Fox was the head coach of each
      team in their previous Super Bowl appearance.  Despite waiving long-time running
      back DeAngelo Williams and losing top wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn
      ACL in the preseason, the Carolina Panthers had their best regular season in
      franchise history, becoming the seventh team to win at least 15 regular season
      games since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in . Carolina started
      the season 14–0, not only setting franchise records for the best start and the
      longest single-season winning streak, but also posting the best start to a season
      by an NFC team in NFL history, breaking the 13–0 record previously shared with
      the 2009 New Orleans Saints and the 2011 Green Bay Packers. With their NFC-best
      15–1 regular season record, the Panthers clinched home-field advantage throughout
      the NFC playoffs for the first time in franchise history. Ten players were selected
      to the Pro Bowl (the most in franchise history) along with eight All-Pro selections.  The
      Panthers'' offense, which led the NFL in scoring (500 points), was loaded with
      talent, boasting six Pro Bowl selections. Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton had
      one of his best seasons, throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 yards,
      while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns (35 passing,
      10 rushing), a career-low 10 interceptions, and a career-best quarterback rating
      of 99.4. Newton''s leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen, who caught a
      career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns, and wide receiver
      Ted Ginn Jr., who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns; Ginn also
      rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards. Other key receivers
      included veteran Jerricho Cotchery (39 receptions for 485 yards), rookie Devin
      Funchess (31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns), and second-year
      receiver Corey Brown (31 receptions for 447 yards). The Panthers'' backfield
      featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart, who led the team with 989 rushing
      yards and six touchdowns in 13 games, along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert,
      who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards. Carolina''s
      offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections: center Ryan Kalil and
      guard Trai Turner.  The Panthers'' defense gave up just 308 points, ranking
      sixth in the league, while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and
      boasting four Pro Bowl selections. Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led
      the team in sacks with 11, while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two.
      Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6½ sacks. The Panthers defensive line also
      featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen, a 5-time Pro Bowl selection, who
      was the NFL''s active career sack leader with 136, along with defensive end
      Kony Ealy, who had five sacks in just nine starts. Behind them, two of the Panthers''
      three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl: Thomas
      Davis and Luke Kuechly. Davis compiled 5½ sacks, four forced fumbles, and four
      interceptions, while Kuechly led the team in tackles (118) forced two fumbles,
      and intercepted four passes of his own. Carolina''s secondary featured Pro Bowl
      safety Kurt Coleman, who led the team with a career high seven interceptions,
      while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman, who developed
      into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions, two of
      which were returned for touchdowns.  After losing in the divisional round of
      the playoffs during three of the previous four seasons, the Denver Broncos''
      general manager John Elway made numerous coaching changes, including a mutual
      parting with head coach John Fox, who had won four divisional championships
      in his four years as Broncos head coach, being replaced in that role by Gary
      Kubiak, Elway''s former backup quarterback and former Broncos offensive coordinator.
      Wade Phillips, a former Broncos head coach, returned to the team to serve his
      second stint as defensive coordinator, succeeding Jack Del Rio who had left
      to take the head coaching vacancy at the Oakland Raiders. The team''s 43–8 loss
      in Super Bowl XLVIII two years earlier, despite holding the regular season''s
      top offense, resulted in Elway signing defensive end DeMarcus Ware, cornerback
      Aqib Talib, safety T. J. Ward, and wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders for the 2014
      season.  Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense
      with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning''s shotgun passing
      style, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line,
      as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year
      with the Indianapolis Colts in , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel
      that he had suffered since the summer. In addition, Manning was getting old,
      as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Though the team had a 7–0 start, Manning
      led the NFL in interceptions. In Week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of
      the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL''s all-time record for
      career passing yards in this game, but after throwing four interceptions, he
      was benched in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as
      the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. After a slow start
      in Denver''s final regular season game against San Diego, Osweiler was benched
      leading to Manning''s return. Manning re-claimed the starting quarterback position
      for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team
      to clinch the AFC''s No. 1 seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips,
      who replaced his predecessor''s complicated read-and-react scheme with a simple
      aggressive approach of attacking the ball, the Broncos'' defense ranked No.
      1 in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous
      three seasons, the team continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise
      records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense,
      the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field
      advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.  Manning finished the year with a career-low
      67.9 passer rating, throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns, with 17 interceptions.
      In contrast, Osweiler threw for 1,967 yards, 10 touchdowns and six interceptions
      for a rating of 86.4. Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105
      receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns, while Emmanuel Sanders caught
      76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores, while adding another 106 yards returning
      punts. Tight end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with
      46 receptions for 517 yards. Running back C. J. Anderson was the team''s leading
      rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns, while also catching 25 passes for 183
      yards. Running back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards, five
      touchdowns, 24 receptions, and a 4.2 yards per carry average. Overall, the offense
      ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections.  The
      Broncos'' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed (4,530) for the first
      time in franchise history, and fourth in points allowed (296). Defensive ends
      Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson each had 5½ sacks. Pro Bowl linebacker Von Miller
      led the team with 11 sacks, forced four fumbles, and recovered three. Linebacker
      DeMarcus Ware was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the ninth time in his
      career, ranking second on the team with 7½ sacks. Linebacker Brandon Marshall
      led the team in total tackles with 109, while Danny Trevathan ranked second
      with 102 tackles. Cornerbacks Aqib Talib (three interceptions) and Chris Harris
      Jr. (two interceptions) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the defense,
      though none of the players selected for the Pro Bowl participated due to the
      Broncos reaching Super Bowl 50.  The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the
      divisional round, running up a 31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious
      second half comeback attempt to win 31–24, avenging their elimination from a
      year earlier. The Panthers then blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship
      Game, 49–15, racking up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers.  The Broncos
      defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round, 23–16, by scoring
      11 points in the final three minutes of the game. They then defeated the defending
      Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game,
      20–18, by intercepting a pass on New England''s 2-point conversion attempt with
      17 seconds left on the clock and recovering a subsequent onside kick attempt.  Carolina
      suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis, an 11-year veteran who had already
      overcome three ACL tears in his career, went down with a broken arm in the NFC
      Championship Game. Despite this, he insisted he would still find a way to play
      in the Super Bowl. His prediction turned out to be accurate and he made it into
      the starting lineup.  Peyton Manning reached his fourth Super Bowl, with appearances
      under as many head coaches (Tony Dungy, Jim Caldwell, John Fox and Gary Kubiak).
      He became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple
      Super Bowls. He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl
      at age 39. The past record was held by John Elway, who led the Broncos to victory
      in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver''s Executive Vice President
      of Football Operations and General Manager.  Manning and Newton set the record
      for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13
      years and 48 days (Manning was 39, Newton was 26). In addition, this was the
      first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the #1 pick
      in their draft classes. Manning was the #1 selection of the 1998 NFL Draft,
      while Newton was picked first in 2011. The matchup also pits the top two picks
      of the 2011 draft against each other: Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for
      Denver.  With Ron Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in
      Super Bowl XX, and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos'' defeats
      in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV, this was the first Super Bowl in which both head
      coaches played in the game themselves; coincidentally, the coaches they had
      played under, Mike Ditka (Rivera) and Dan Reeves (Kubiak), not only had Super
      Bowl playing experience themselves, but had done so as teammates with the Dallas
      Cowboys in Super Bowls V and VI (and worked together as Cowboys assistant coaches
      for Super Bowls X, XII and XIII).  Concerns were raised over whether Levi''s
      Stadium''s field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl; during the
      inaugural season, the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various
      issues, and earlier in the 2015 season, a portion of the turf collapsed under
      Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, causing him to slip and miss a field
      goal, although the field has not had any major issues since. As is customary
      for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums, the NFL re-sodded the
      hybrid Bermuda 419 turf playing surface prior to the game; NFL and Atlanta Braves
      field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in "great shape" for the
      game. However, the turf showed problems throughout the game, with a number of
      players needing to change their cleats during the game and players slipping
      during plays all throughout the game.  As the designated home team in the annual
      rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Broncos elected to wear their road white
      jerseys with matching white pants. Elway stated, "We''ve had Super Bowl success
      in our white uniforms." The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants
      in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII, Elway''s last game as Denver QB, when
      they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19. In their only other Super Bowl win
      in Super Bowl XXXII, Denver wore blue jerseys, which was their primary color
      at the time. They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys, but
      they are 0–4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys, losing in Super Bowl
      XII, XXII, XXIV, and XLVIII. The only other AFC champion team to have worn white
      as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers; they
      defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior. The Broncos''
      decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform:
      black jerseys with silver pants.  The Panthers used the San Jose State practice
      facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott. The Broncos practiced at Stanford
      University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott.  On June 4, 2014, the NFL
      announced that the game would be branded with Arabic numerals as "Super Bowl
      50"—rather than with Roman numerals, a practice established at Super Bowl V
      under which the game would have been known as "Super Bowl L". NFL creative director
      Shandon Melvin, explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty
      in designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter "L" using the standardized
      logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV. He noted that "L" was harder to
      design around as it is asymmetrical unlike other Roman numerals, and also showed
      concerns that use of the letter "L" could be interpreted as the "loser" hand
      gesture. 73 different mockups, incorporating either "L" or "50", were designed
      before the final design was chosen, which featured large numerals colored in
      gold behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead of underneath and in silver as
      in the standard logo.  Tying into the game''s "golden anniversary," various
      gold-themed promotions and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season.
      The league adopted a gold-tinted logo, which was implemented across all of the
      NFL''s properties and painted on fields during the season. The numbering of
      the 50-yard line on fields was colored gold, and beginning on week 7, all sideline
      jackets and hats featured gold-trimmed logos. Gold footballs were given to each
      high school that has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl, and "homecoming"
      events were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games.  Ten themed "50"
      statues were placed in locations across San Francisco to promote the game; however,
      due to the negativity towards the game by residents of the city, the statues
      notably became the target of vandals, with the "SUPER BOWL 50" lettering on
      their bases re-arranged to form other phrases such as "SUPERB OWL", "SUP BRO
      50", and after the Alamo Square statue was toppled, "OOPS".  The annual NFL
      Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. In addition, "Super
      Bowl City" opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero, featuring
      games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area''s technology, culinary
      creations, and cultural diversity. More than a million people are expected to
      attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week. San Francisco
      mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area "they
      are going to have to leave". San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully
      lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount
      of $5 million.  In addition, there are $2 million worth of other ancillary events,
      including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center, a beer, wine
      and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University, and a pep rally.
      A professional fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual
      donors, but still may need the city council to help fund the event. Additional
      funding will be provided by the city council, which has announced plans to set
      aside seed funding for the event.  The game''s media day, which was typically
      held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game, was moved to the Monday evening
      and re-branded as "Super Bowl Opening Night". The event was held on February
      1, 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose. Alongside the traditional media availabilities,
      the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica
      of the Golden Gate Bridge.  For the first time, the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee
      and the NFL have openly sought disabled veteran and lesbian, gay, bisexual and
      transgender-owned businesses in Business Connect, the Super Bowl program that
      provides local companies with contracting opportunities in and around the Super
      Bowl. The host committee has already raised over $40 million through sponsors
      including Apple, Google, Yahoo!, Intel, Gap, Chevron, and Dignity Health.  The
      Super Bowl 50 Host Committee has vowed to be "the most giving Super Bowl ever",
      and will dedicate 25 percent of all money it raises for philanthropic causes
      in the Bay Area. The committee created the 50 fund as its philanthropic initiative
      and focuses on providing grants to aid with youth development, community investment
      and sustainable environments.  In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that
      all Super Bowl champions receive, the winning team also received a large, 18-karat
      gold-plated "50". Each digit weighs for a total of . Like the Lombardi Trophy,
      the "50" was designed by Tiffany & Co.  After putting out a call for volunteers
      in June 2015, over 450 volunteers helped to make the Super Bowl 50 Tour happen.
      More than 5,000 volunteers were on hand to help with events leading up to, during
      and after Super Bowl 50 as well. Volunteers signed up for a minimum of 3–4 hour
      shifts, and some volunteers gave more than 200 hours of their time over the
      course of the week. As a thank you for volunteering, volunteers were gifted
      backpacks and uniforms.  In the United States, the game was televised by CBS,
      as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the
      NFL. The network''s lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the
      contest, with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines. CBS introduced
      new features during the telecast, including pylon cameras and microphones along
      with "EyeVision 360"—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be
      used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and "bullet time" effects. (An earlier
      version of "EyeVision" was last used in Super Bowl XXXV; for Super Bowl 50,
      the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution.) CBS provided digital streams of
      the game via CBSSports.com, and the CBS Sports apps on tablets, Windows 10,
      Xbox One and other digital media players (such as Chromecast and Roku). Due
      to Verizon Communications exclusivity, streaming on smartphones was only provided
      to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service.  On December 28, 2015,
      ESPN announced that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to provide
      a dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of Super Bowl 50, airing on ESPN Deportes
      and streaming on WatchESPN, featuring commentary and surrounding coverage in
      the language; unlike Fox and NBC, CBS does not have a Spanish-language cable
      network that could have carried such a broadcast. The production utilized CBS''s
      video, but with Spanish-language graphics provided by ESPN, and its "Monday
      Night Football" commentary crew of Alvaro Martin, Raul Allegre, and sideline
      reporter John Sutcliffe. ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game and post-game coverage,
      while Martin, Allegre, and Sutcliffe also contributed reports for the English-language
      ESPN as part of efforts to promote the simulcast. ESPN Deportes'' vice president
      of programming Freddy Rolon felt that dedicated Spanish-language coverage appealed
      better to Hispanic viewers than Spanish commentary on the SAP audio channel,
      going on to say that "I have family members who watch Spanish language television
      and they don''t know where that SAP button is to begin with".  As opposed to
      broadcasts of primetime series, CBS broadcast special episodes of its late-night
      talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50, beginning with a special
      episode of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" following the game. Following
      a break for late local programming, CBS also aired a special episode of "The
      Late Late Show with James Corden".  With an average TV audience of 111.9 million,
      the game was the third most-watched Super Bowl—and third most-watched U.S. program—in
      history, according to the Nielsen ratings. It was also the most-watched program
      of all-time in terms of total audience, 167-million, which measures those who
      viewed at least six minutes of the broadcast. Average viewership is the industry
      standard for determining television ratings, while total audience is a supplemental
      metric. The Spanish-language broadcast on ESPN Deportes was seen by an average
      of 472,000 viewers; it ranked behind Super Bowl XLVIII as the second-most-watched
      Spanish-language cable telecast in U.S. history, outside of soccer games.  CBS
      set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $5,000,000, a record high
      price for a Super Bowl ad. As of January 26, the advertisements had not yet
      sold out. CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time
      on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game, meaning that for
      the first time, digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising
      in pattern with the television broadcast. This would be the final year in a
      multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer
      to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount. It was also
      the final year that Doritos, a longtime sponsor of the game, held its "Crash
      the Super Bowl" contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads
      for a chance to have it aired during the game. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company
      also made their Super Bowl debut, Hyundai placed in both first and fifth place
      respectively on "USA Today"s Super Bowl Ad Meter survey, with their ads "First
      Date" (for the Hyundai Genesis) and "Ryanville" (for the 2017 Hyundai Elantra).  First-time
      advertisers at Super Bowl 50 included Amazon.com, Colgate toothpaste, Death
      Wish Coffee (who beat 10 other small businesses in a contest held by Intuit,
      who paid for the ad time as a prize), LG Electronics, Marmot, Nintendo (promoting
      the 20th anniversary of the "Pokémon" franchise), PayPal, and SoFi.  20th Century
      Fox, Lionsgate, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios and Walt Disney Studios
      paid for movie trailers to be aired during the Super Bowl. Fox paid for "Deadpool",
      "", "" and "Eddie the Eagle", Lionsgate paid for "Gods of Egypt", Paramount
      paid for "" and "10 Cloverfield Lane", Universal paid for "The Secret Life of
      Pets" and the debut trailer for "Jason Bourne" and Disney paid for "", "The
      Jungle Book" and "Alice Through the Looking Glass".  Westwood One carried the
      game throughout North America, with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer,
      Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts, and James Lofton and Mark Malone
      as sideline reporters. Jim Gray anchored the pre-game and halftime coverage.  The
      flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team carried their
      local play-by-play calls. In Denver, KOA (850 AM) and KRFX (103.5 FM) carried
      the game, with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary.
      In North Carolina, WBT (1110 AM) carried the game, with Mick Mixon on play-by-play
      and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary. WBT also simulcast the
      game on its sister station WBT-FM (99.3 FM), based in Chester, South Carolina.
      As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations, the local broadcasts were audible
      over much of the western United States after sunset (for Denver) and the eastern
      United States throughout the game (for Carolina). In accordance with contractual
      rules, the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks either
      carried the Westwood One feed or did not air the game at all.  In the United
      Kingdom, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra carried the contest. As in
      previous years, the BBC aired its own commercial-free British English broadcast,
      with Greg Brady, Darren Fletcher and Rocky Boiman on commentary.  In honor of
      the 50th Super Bowl, the pregame ceremony featured the on-field introduction
      of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players. Bart Starr (MVP of
      Super Bowls I and II) and Chuck Howley (MVP of Super Bowl V) appeared via video.
      The late Harvey Martin, co-MVP of Super Bowl XII who died in 2001, was acknowledged
      when the other co-MVP of Super Bowl XII, Randy White, was introduced. Peyton
      Manning (MVP of Super Bowl XLI and the Broncos'' starting quarterback for the
      game) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game. This ceremony continued
      a ten-year tradition (starting with Super Bowl XX and then repeated in Super
      Bowl XXX and Super Bowl XL) in which past Super Bowl MVPs were honored before
      the game.  Lady Gaga sang the national anthem, while Marlee Matlin simultaneously
      performed an American Sign Language (ASL) version of it. Matlin also signed
      an a cappella version of "America the Beautiful", which was sung by a U.S. Armed
      Forces chorus.  In late November 2015, reports surfaced stating that "multiple
      acts" would perform during the halftime show. On December 3, the league confirmed
      that the show would be headlined by the British rock band Coldplay. On January
      7, 2016, Pepsi confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé, who headlined
      the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single
      "Hymn for the Weekend" (which was removed from the setlist before the game),
      would be making an appearance. Bruno Mars, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII
      halftime show, and Mark Ronson (Mars''s collaborator on "Uptown Funk") also
      performed.  Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong. Peyton Manning
      completed an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver
      Andre Caldwell. A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards
      to the Panthers 14-yard line, but Carolina''s defense dug in over the next three
      plays. First, linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss.
      Then after an incompletion, Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain
      on third down, forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus
      34-yard field goal. The score marked the first time in the entire postseason
      that Carolina was facing a deficit. After each team punted, Panthers quarterback
      Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass to Jerricho Cotchery, but the
      call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge. CBS analyst
      and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the
      review clearly showed the pass was complete. Two plays later, on 3rd-and-10
      from the 15-yard line, linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton''s
      hands while sacking him, and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for
      a Broncos touchdown, giving the team a 10–0 lead. This was the first fumble
      return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993
      season.  After a punt from both teams, Carolina got on track with a 9-play,
      73-yard scoring drive. Newton completed all four of his pass attempts for 51
      yards and rushed twice for 25 yards, while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive
      with a 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the
      second quarter. Later on, Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman''s
      short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players, but none of them attempted
      to make a tackle, apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch. Norwood
      had not done so, and with no resistance around him, he took off for a Super
      Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers
      14-yard line. Despite Denver''s excellent field position, they could not get
      the ball into the end zone, so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased
      their lead to 13–7.  On Carolina''s next possession, fullback Mike Tolbert lost
      a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart, which linebacker Danny
      Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line. However, the Panthers soon
      took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself
      and then intercepted it, returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard
      line with 1:55 left on the clock. The Panthers could not gain any yards with
      their possession and had to punt. After a Denver punt, Carolina drove to the
      Broncos 45-yard line. But with 11 seconds left and no timeouts left, Newton
      was sacked by DeMarcus Ware causing time for the half to expire.  The Panthers
      seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton
      completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their
      second offensive play. But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard
      line, and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard
      field goal attempt. After the miss, Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel
      Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards, setting up McManus'' 33-yard field goal
      that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead. Carolina got off to another strong start
      after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown. But
      once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced
      off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J. Ward. Ward fumbled
      the ball deep in Denver territory during the return, but Trevathan was able
      to recover the ball enabling Denver to keep possession. There would be no more
      scoring in the third quarter, but early in the fourth, the Broncos drove to
      the Panthers 41-yard line. On the next play, Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning''s
      hand as he was winding up for a pass, and then recovered it for Carolina on
      the 50-yard line. A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by
      Stewart then set up Gano''s 39-yard field goal, cutting the Panthers deficit
      to one score at 16–10. The next three drives of the game would end in punts.  With
      4:51 left in regulation, Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with
      a chance to mount a game-winning drive, and soon faced 3rd-and-9. On the next
      play, Miller stripped the ball away from Newton, and after several players dove
      for it, it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward, who returned
      it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line. Newton was the third player to attempt
      a recovery (following Ware and Mike Remmers) of the ball and while various angles
      appeared to show that he had a decent probability of recovery if he''d dived
      in his attempt, Newton instead hesitated and then tried to drop on top of the
      ball, which failed. This split second decision later earned him criticism. Meanwhile,
      Denver''s offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays, but a holding
      penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs. Then
      Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie
      Fowler for a 2-point conversion, giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and
      essentially putting the game away. Carolina had two more drives and managed
      one first down between them before the game ended.  Manning finished the game
      13 of 23 for 141 yards with one interception, two fumbles, and was sacked 5
      times. Sanders was his top receiver with six receptions for 83 yards. Anderson
      was the game''s leading rusher with 90 yards and a touchdown, along with four
      receptions for 10 yards. Miller had six total tackles (five solo), 2½ sacks,
      and two forced fumbles. Ware had five total tackles and two sacks. Ward had
      seven total tackles, a fumble recovery, and an interception. McManus made all
      four of his field goals, making him perfect on all 11 attempts during the post-season.  Newton
      completed 18 of 41 passes for 265 yards with one interception, two fumbles,
      and was sacked 6 times. He was also his team''s leading rusher with 45 yards
      on six carries. Brown caught four passes for 80 yards, while Ginn had four receptions
      for 74 yards. Ginn was sacked once on a trick play. Ealy was the top defensive
      performer for Carolina with four total tackles, three sacks, a forced fumble,
      a fumble recovery, and an interception. Defensive end Charles Johnson had four
      total tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble. Linebacker Luke Kuechly had 11 total
      tackles and a sack, while Thomas Davis had seven total tackles, despite playing
      just two weeks after breaking his right arm in the NFC title game.  Super Bowl
      50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams. Denver won despite
      being massively outgained in total yards (315 to 194) and first downs (21 to
      11). Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by
      a Super Bowl winning team, as the previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore
      Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. Only seven other teams had ever gained fewer than
      200 yards in a Super Bowl, and all of them had lost. This was the first Super
      Bowl since Super Bowl XXXVI that the winning team scored only a single offensive
      touchdown, although the Broncos defense had earlier in the game scored a touchdown
      from a fumble recovery in the end zone. The Broncos'' seven sacks tied a Super
      Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. Manning was sacked five
      times by the Panthers, giving this game highest total (12) of combined sacks
      in Super Bowl history. Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks,
      and is the only such player to do so and record an interception. Jordan Norwood''s
      61-yard punt return set a new record, surpassing the old record of 45 yards
      set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII. Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down,
      while Carolina was 3-of-15. The two teams'' combined third down conversion percentage
      of 13.8 was the lowest in Super Bowl history. Manning and Newton had quarterback
      passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4, respectively, and their added total of 112
      is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl. Manning became
      the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39, the first quarterback
      ever to win a Super Bowl starting for two different teams, and the first quarterback
      ever to win 200 games (regular season and postseason) as a starter. Gary Kubiak
      became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went
      to the Super Bowl with as a player.  Manning announced his retirement from the
      NFL a month after the Super Bowl. This was also the final game in the career
      of Panthers defensive lineman Jared Allen, who retired as the NFL''s ninth all-time
      leader in sacks.  Completions/attempts<br>Carries<br>Long gain<br>Receptions  Super

      open the 2016 NFL regular season. It was the first meeting of both Super Bowl
      participants during Week 1 of the following season since the 1970 season when
      the Minnesota Vikings and Kansas City Chiefs held a rematch of Super Bowl IV
      to kick off the post-merger era of the NFL. The Broncos prevailed 21-20 as Carolina
      missed a field goal attempt to end the game. '

    context: ' Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion
      of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season. The American Football
      Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference
      (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to win their third Super Bowl championship.
      The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi''s Stadium in Santa Clara,
      California (located in the San Francisco Bay Area). As this was the 50th Super
      Bowl, the league emphasized the "golden anniversary" with various gold-themed
      initiatives during the 2015 season, as well as suspending the tradition of naming
      each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been
      known as "Super Bowl L"), so the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals
      50.  The Panthers finished the regular season with a 15–1 record, racking up
      the league''s top offense, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most
      Valuable Player (MVP). They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49–15 in the NFC
      Championship Game and advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance since the
      franchise was founded in 1995. The Broncos finished the regular season with
      a 12–4 record, thanks to having the league''s top defense, and despite the struggles
      of starting quarterback Peyton Manning; they defeated the defending Super Bowl
      champion New England Patriots 20–18 in the AFC Championship Game. They joined
      the Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, and Pittsburgh Steelers as one of four teams that
      have made eight appearances in the Super Bowl.  In one of the most defensive
      Super Bowl matchups in NFL history, the Broncos took an early lead in Super
      Bowl 50 and never trailed. Denver recorded seven sacks and forced three turnovers.
      Carolina likewise kept pace by recording five sacks and forcing two turnovers.
      Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super Bowl MVP. This game was also the
      final game of Peyton Manning''s career; he announced his retirement on March
      7, 2016.  CBS'' broadcast of the game was the third most-watched program in
      American television history with an average of 111.9 million viewers. The network
      charged an average of $5 million for a 30-second commercial during the game.
      The Super Bowl 50 halftime show was headlined by Coldplay, with special guest
      performers Beyoncé and Bruno Mars.  In early 2012, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell
      stated that the league planned to make the 50th Super Bowl "spectacular" and
      that it would be "an important game for us as a league".  Cities included in
      early discussions or that submitted bids included:   The league eventually narrowed
      the bids to three sites: New Orleans'' Mercedes-Benz Superdome, Miami''s Sun
      Life Stadium, and the San Francisco Bay Area''s Levi''s Stadium.  The league
      announced on October 16, 2012, that the two finalists were Sun Life Stadium
      and Levi''s Stadium. The South Florida/Miami area has previously hosted the
      event 10 times (tied for most with New Orleans), with the most recent one being
      Super Bowl XLIV in 2010. The San Francisco Bay Area last hosted in 1985 (Super
      Bowl XIX), held at Stanford Stadium in Stanford, California, won by the home
      team 49ers. The Miami bid depended on whether the stadium underwent renovations.
      However, on May 3, 2013, the Florida legislature refused to approve the funding
      plan to pay for the renovations, dealing a significant blow to Miami''s chances.  On
      May 21, 2013, NFL owners at their spring meetings in Boston voted and awarded
      the game to Levi''s Stadium. The $1.2 billion stadium opened in 2014. It is
      the first Super Bowl held in the San Francisco Bay Area since Super Bowl XIX
      in 1985, and the first in California since Super Bowl XXXVII took place in San
      Diego in 2003.  For the third straight season, the number one seeds in the NFC
      and AFC, the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos, met in the Super Bowl. The
      game also featured the league''s top scoring offense (Panthers) against the
      league''s top defense (Broncos). The Panthers became the 10th team since 1960
      to have lost just one game during the regular season, and the sixth team ever
      to have a 15–1 record. It was their second Super Bowl appearance; the other
      was Super Bowl XXXVIII. The Broncos became the fourth team to have eight Super
      Bowl appearances. It was their second appearance in three years, having also
      reached Super Bowl XLVIII. Coincidentally, John Fox was the head coach of each
      team in their previous Super Bowl appearance.  Despite waiving long-time running
      back DeAngelo Williams and losing top wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn
      ACL in the preseason, the Carolina Panthers had their best regular season in
      franchise history, becoming the seventh team to win at least 15 regular season
      games since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in . Carolina started
      the season 14–0, not only setting franchise records for the best start and the
      longest single-season winning streak, but also posting the best start to a season
      by an NFC team in NFL history, breaking the 13–0 record previously shared with
      the 2009 New Orleans Saints and the 2011 Green Bay Packers. With their NFC-best
      15–1 regular season record, the Panthers clinched home-field advantage throughout
      the NFC playoffs for the first time in franchise history. Ten players were selected
      to the Pro Bowl (the most in franchise history) along with eight All-Pro selections.  The
      Panthers'' offense, which led the NFL in scoring (500 points), was loaded with
      talent, boasting six Pro Bowl selections. Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton had
      one of his best seasons, throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 yards,
      while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns (35 passing,
      10 rushing), a career-low 10 interceptions, and a career-best quarterback rating
      of 99.4. Newton''s leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen, who caught a
      career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns, and wide receiver
      Ted Ginn Jr., who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns; Ginn also
      rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards. Other key receivers
      included veteran Jerricho Cotchery (39 receptions for 485 yards), rookie Devin
      Funchess (31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns), and second-year
      receiver Corey Brown (31 receptions for 447 yards). The Panthers'' backfield
      featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart, who led the team with 989 rushing
      yards and six touchdowns in 13 games, along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert,
      who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards. Carolina''s
      offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections: center Ryan Kalil and
      guard Trai Turner.  The Panthers'' defense gave up just 308 points, ranking
      sixth in the league, while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and
      boasting four Pro Bowl selections. Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led
      the team in sacks with 11, while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two.
      Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6½ sacks. The Panthers defensive line also
      featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen, a 5-time Pro Bowl selection, who
      was the NFL''s active career sack leader with 136, along with defensive end
      Kony Ealy, who had five sacks in just nine starts. Behind them, two of the Panthers''
      three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl: Thomas
      Davis and Luke Kuechly. Davis compiled 5½ sacks, four forced fumbles, and four
      interceptions, while Kuechly led the team in tackles (118) forced two fumbles,
      and intercepted four passes of his own. Carolina''s secondary featured Pro Bowl
      safety Kurt Coleman, who led the team with a career high seven interceptions,
      while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman, who developed
      into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions, two of
      which were returned for touchdowns.  After losing in the divisional round of
      the playoffs during three of the previous four seasons, the Denver Broncos''
      general manager John Elway made numerous coaching changes, including a mutual
      parting with head coach John Fox, who had won four divisional championships
      in his four years as Broncos head coach, being replaced in that role by Gary
      Kubiak, Elway''s former backup quarterback and former Broncos offensive coordinator.
      Wade Phillips, a former Broncos head coach, returned to the team to serve his
      second stint as defensive coordinator, succeeding Jack Del Rio who had left
      to take the head coaching vacancy at the Oakland Raiders. The team''s 43–8 loss
      in Super Bowl XLVIII two years earlier, despite holding the regular season''s
      top offense, resulted in Elway signing defensive end DeMarcus Ware, cornerback
      Aqib Talib, safety T. J. Ward, and wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders for the 2014
      season.  Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense
      with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning''s shotgun passing
      style, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line,
      as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year
      with the Indianapolis Colts in , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel
      that he had suffered since the summer. In addition, Manning was getting old,
      as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Though the team had a 7–0 start, Manning
      led the NFL in interceptions. In Week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of
      the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL''s all-time record for
      career passing yards in this game, but after throwing four interceptions, he
      was benched in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as
      the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. After a slow start
      in Denver''s final regular season game against San Diego, Osweiler was benched
      leading to Manning''s return. Manning re-claimed the starting quarterback position
      for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team
      to clinch the AFC''s No. 1 seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips,
      who replaced his predecessor''s complicated read-and-react scheme with a simple
      aggressive approach of attacking the ball, the Broncos'' defense ranked No.
      1 in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous
      three seasons, the team continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise
      records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense,
      the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field
      advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.  Manning finished the year with a career-low
      67.9 passer rating, throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns, with 17 interceptions.
      In contrast, Osweiler threw for 1,967 yards, 10 touchdowns and six interceptions
      for a rating of 86.4. Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105
      receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns, while Emmanuel Sanders caught
      76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores, while adding another 106 yards returning
      punts. Tight end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with
      46 receptions for 517 yards. Running back C. J. Anderson was the team''s leading
      rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns, while also catching 25 passes for 183
      yards. Running back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards, five
      touchdowns, 24 receptions, and a 4.2 yards per carry average. Overall, the offense
      ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections.  The
      Broncos'' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed (4,530) for the first
      time in franchise history, and fourth in points allowed (296). Defensive ends
      Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson each had 5½ sacks. Pro Bowl linebacker Von Miller
      led the team with 11 sacks, forced four fumbles, and recovered three. Linebacker
      DeMarcus Ware was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the ninth time in his
      career, ranking second on the team with 7½ sacks. Linebacker Brandon Marshall
      led the team in total tackles with 109, while Danny Trevathan ranked second
      with 102 tackles. Cornerbacks Aqib Talib (three interceptions) and Chris Harris
      Jr. (two interceptions) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the defense,
      though none of the players selected for the Pro Bowl participated due to the
      Broncos reaching Super Bowl 50.  The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the
      divisional round, running up a 31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious
      second half comeback attempt to win 31–24, avenging their elimination from a
      year earlier. The Panthers then blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship
      Game, 49–15, racking up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers.  The Broncos
      defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round, 23–16, by scoring
      11 points in the final three minutes of the game. They then defeated the defending
      Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game,
      20–18, by intercepting a pass on New England''s 2-point conversion attempt with
      17 seconds left on the clock and recovering a subsequent onside kick attempt.  Carolina
      suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis, an 11-year veteran who had already
      overcome three ACL tears in his career, went down with a broken arm in the NFC
      Championship Game. Despite this, he insisted he would still find a way to play
      in the Super Bowl. His prediction turned out to be accurate and he made it into
      the starting lineup.  Peyton Manning reached his fourth Super Bowl, with appearances
      under as many head coaches (Tony Dungy, Jim Caldwell, John Fox and Gary Kubiak).
      He became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple
      Super Bowls. He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl
      at age 39. The past record was held by John Elway, who led the Broncos to victory
      in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver''s Executive Vice President
      of Football Operations and General Manager.  Manning and Newton set the record
      for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13
      years and 48 days (Manning was 39, Newton was 26). In addition, this was the
      first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the #1 pick
      in their draft classes. Manning was the #1 selection of the 1998 NFL Draft,
      while Newton was picked first in 2011. The matchup also pits the top two picks
      of the 2011 draft against each other: Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for
      Denver.  With Ron Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in
      Super Bowl XX, and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos'' defeats
      in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV, this was the first Super Bowl in which both head
      coaches played in the game themselves; coincidentally, the coaches they had
      played under, Mike Ditka (Rivera) and Dan Reeves (Kubiak), not only had Super
      Bowl playing experience themselves, but had done so as teammates with the Dallas
      Cowboys in Super Bowls V and VI (and worked together as Cowboys assistant coaches
      for Super Bowls X, XII and XIII).  Concerns were raised over whether Levi''s
      Stadium''s field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl; during the
      inaugural season, the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various
      issues, and earlier in the 2015 season, a portion of the turf collapsed under
      Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, causing him to slip and miss a field
      goal, although the field has not had any major issues since. As is customary
      for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums, the NFL re-sodded the
      hybrid Bermuda 419 turf playing surface prior to the game; NFL and Atlanta Braves
      field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in "great shape" for the
      game. However, the turf showed problems throughout the game, with a number of
      players needing to change their cleats during the game and players slipping
      during plays all throughout the game.  As the designated home team in the annual
      rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Broncos elected to wear their road white
      jerseys with matching white pants. Elway stated, "We''ve had Super Bowl success
      in our white uniforms." The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants
      in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII, Elway''s last game as Denver QB, when
      they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19. In their only other Super Bowl win
      in Super Bowl XXXII, Denver wore blue jerseys, which was their primary color
      at the time. They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys, but
      they are 0–4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys, losing in Super Bowl
      XII, XXII, XXIV, and XLVIII. The only other AFC champion team to have worn white
      as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers; they
      defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior. The Broncos''
      decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform:
      black jerseys with silver pants.  The Panthers used the San Jose State practice
      facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott. The Broncos practiced at Stanford
      University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott.  On June 4, 2014, the NFL
      announced that the game would be branded with Arabic numerals as "Super Bowl
      50"—rather than with Roman numerals, a practice established at Super Bowl V
      under which the game would have been known as "Super Bowl L". NFL creative director
      Shandon Melvin, explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty
      in designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter "L" using the standardized
      logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV. He noted that "L" was harder to
      design around as it is asymmetrical unlike other Roman numerals, and also showed
      concerns that use of the letter "L" could be interpreted as the "loser" hand
      gesture. 73 different mockups, incorporating either "L" or "50", were designed
      before the final design was chosen, which featured large numerals colored in
      gold behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead of underneath and in silver as
      in the standard logo.  Tying into the game''s "golden anniversary," various
      gold-themed promotions and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season.
      The league adopted a gold-tinted logo, which was implemented across all of the
      NFL''s properties and painted on fields during the season. The numbering of
      the 50-yard line on fields was colored gold, and beginning on week 7, all sideline
      jackets and hats featured gold-trimmed logos. Gold footballs were given to each
      high school that has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl, and "homecoming"
      events were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games.  Ten themed "50"
      statues were placed in locations across San Francisco to promote the game; however,
      due to the negativity towards the game by residents of the city, the statues
      notably became the target of vandals, with the "SUPER BOWL 50" lettering on
      their bases re-arranged to form other phrases such as "SUPERB OWL", "SUP BRO
      50", and after the Alamo Square statue was toppled, "OOPS".  The annual NFL
      Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. In addition, "Super
      Bowl City" opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero, featuring
      games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area''s technology, culinary
      creations, and cultural diversity. More than a million people are expected to
      attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week. San Francisco
      mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area "they
      are going to have to leave". San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully
      lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount
      of $5 million.  In addition, there are $2 million worth of other ancillary events,
      including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center, a beer, wine
      and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University, and a pep rally.
      A professional fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual
      donors, but still may need the city council to help fund the event. Additional
      funding will be provided by the city council, which has announced plans to set
      aside seed funding for the event.  The game''s media day, which was typically
      held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game, was moved to the Monday evening
      and re-branded as "Super Bowl Opening Night". The event was held on February
      1, 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose. Alongside the traditional media availabilities,
      the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica
      of the Golden Gate Bridge.  For the first time, the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee
      and the NFL have openly sought disabled veteran and lesbian, gay, bisexual and
      transgender-owned businesses in Business Connect, the Super Bowl program that
      provides local companies with contracting opportunities in and around the Super
      Bowl. The host committee has already raised over $40 million through sponsors
      including Apple, Google, Yahoo!, Intel, Gap, Chevron, and Dignity Health.  The
      Super Bowl 50 Host Committee has vowed to be "the most giving Super Bowl ever",
      and will dedicate 25 percent of all money it raises for philanthropic causes
      in the Bay Area. The committee created the 50 fund as its philanthropic initiative
      and focuses on providing grants to aid with youth development, community investment
      and sustainable environments.  In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that
      all Super Bowl champions receive, the winning team also received a large, 18-karat
      gold-plated "50". Each digit weighs for a total of . Like the Lombardi Trophy,
      the "50" was designed by Tiffany & Co.  After putting out a call for volunteers
      in June 2015, over 450 volunteers helped to make the Super Bowl 50 Tour happen.
      More than 5,000 volunteers were on hand to help with events leading up to, during
      and after Super Bowl 50 as well. Volunteers signed up for a minimum of 3–4 hour
      shifts, and some volunteers gave more than 200 hours of their time over the
      course of the week. As a thank you for volunteering, volunteers were gifted
      backpacks and uniforms.  In the United States, the game was televised by CBS,
      as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the
      NFL. The network''s lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the
      contest, with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines. CBS introduced
      new features during the telecast, including pylon cameras and microphones along
      with "EyeVision 360"—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be
      used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and "bullet time" effects. (An earlier
      version of "EyeVision" was last used in Super Bowl XXXV; for Super Bowl 50,
      the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution.) CBS provided digital streams of
      the game via CBSSports.com, and the CBS Sports apps on tablets, Windows 10,
      Xbox One and other digital media players (such as Chromecast and Roku). Due
      to Verizon Communications exclusivity, streaming on smartphones was only provided
      to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service.  On December 28, 2015,
      ESPN announced that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to provide
      a dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of Super Bowl 50, airing on ESPN Deportes
      and streaming on WatchESPN, featuring commentary and surrounding coverage in
      the language; unlike Fox and NBC, CBS does not have a Spanish-language cable
      network that could have carried such a broadcast. The production utilized CBS''s
      video, but with Spanish-language graphics provided by ESPN, and its "Monday
      Night Football" commentary crew of Alvaro Martin, Raul Allegre, and sideline
      reporter John Sutcliffe. ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game and post-game coverage,
      while Martin, Allegre, and Sutcliffe also contributed reports for the English-language
      ESPN as part of efforts to promote the simulcast. ESPN Deportes'' vice president
      of programming Freddy Rolon felt that dedicated Spanish-language coverage appealed
      better to Hispanic viewers than Spanish commentary on the SAP audio channel,
      going on to say that "I have family members who watch Spanish language television
      and they don''t know where that SAP button is to begin with".  As opposed to
      broadcasts of primetime series, CBS broadcast special episodes of its late-night
      talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50, beginning with a special
      episode of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" following the game. Following
      a break for late local programming, CBS also aired a special episode of "The
      Late Late Show with James Corden".  With an average TV audience of 111.9 million,
      the game was the third most-watched Super Bowl—and third most-watched U.S. program—in
      history, according to the Nielsen ratings. It was also the most-watched program
      of all-time in terms of total audience, 167-million, which measures those who
      viewed at least six minutes of the broadcast. Average viewership is the industry
      standard for determining television ratings, while total audience is a supplemental
      metric. The Spanish-language broadcast on ESPN Deportes was seen by an average
      of 472,000 viewers; it ranked behind Super Bowl XLVIII as the second-most-watched
      Spanish-language cable telecast in U.S. history, outside of soccer games.  CBS
      set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $5,000,000, a record high
      price for a Super Bowl ad. As of January 26, the advertisements had not yet
      sold out. CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time
      on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game, meaning that for
      the first time, digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising
      in pattern with the television broadcast. This would be the final year in a
      multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer
      to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount. It was also
      the final year that Doritos, a longtime sponsor of the game, held its "Crash
      the Super Bowl" contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads
      for a chance to have it aired during the game. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company
      also made their Super Bowl debut, Hyundai placed in both first and fifth place
      respectively on "USA Today"s Super Bowl Ad Meter survey, with their ads "First
      Date" (for the Hyundai Genesis) and "Ryanville" (for the 2017 Hyundai Elantra).  First-time
      advertisers at Super Bowl 50 included Amazon.com, Colgate toothpaste, Death
      Wish Coffee (who beat 10 other small businesses in a contest held by Intuit,
      who paid for the ad time as a prize), LG Electronics, Marmot, Nintendo (promoting
      the 20th anniversary of the "Pokémon" franchise), PayPal, and SoFi.  20th Century
      Fox, Lionsgate, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios and Walt Disney Studios
      paid for movie trailers to be aired during the Super Bowl. Fox paid for "Deadpool",
      "", "" and "Eddie the Eagle", Lionsgate paid for "Gods of Egypt", Paramount
      paid for "" and "10 Cloverfield Lane", Universal paid for "The Secret Life of
      Pets" and the debut trailer for "Jason Bourne" and Disney paid for "", "The
      Jungle Book" and "Alice Through the Looking Glass".  Westwood One carried the
      game throughout North America, with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer,
      Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts, and James Lofton and Mark Malone
      as sideline reporters. Jim Gray anchored the pre-game and halftime coverage.  The
      flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team carried their
      local play-by-play calls. In Denver, KOA (850 AM) and KRFX (103.5 FM) carried
      the game, with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary.
      In North Carolina, WBT (1110 AM) carried the game, with Mick Mixon on play-by-play
      and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary. WBT also simulcast the
      game on its sister station WBT-FM (99.3 FM), based in Chester, South Carolina.
      As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations, the local broadcasts were audible
      over much of the western United States after sunset (for Denver) and the eastern
      United States throughout the game (for Carolina). In accordance with contractual
      rules, the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks either
      carried the Westwood One feed or did not air the game at all.  In the United
      Kingdom, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra carried the contest. As in
      previous years, the BBC aired its own commercial-free British English broadcast,
      with Greg Brady, Darren Fletcher and Rocky Boiman on commentary.  In honor of
      the 50th Super Bowl, the pregame ceremony featured the on-field introduction
      of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players. Bart Starr (MVP of
      Super Bowls I and II) and Chuck Howley (MVP of Super Bowl V) appeared via video.
      The late Harvey Martin, co-MVP of Super Bowl XII who died in 2001, was acknowledged
      when the other co-MVP of Super Bowl XII, Randy White, was introduced. Peyton
      Manning (MVP of Super Bowl XLI and the Broncos'' starting quarterback for the
      game) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game. This ceremony continued
      a ten-year tradition (starting with Super Bowl XX and then repeated in Super
      Bowl XXX and Super Bowl XL) in which past Super Bowl MVPs were honored before
      the game.  Lady Gaga sang the national anthem, while Marlee Matlin simultaneously
      performed an American Sign Language (ASL) version of it. Matlin also signed
      an a cappella version of "America the Beautiful", which was sung by a U.S. Armed
      Forces chorus.  In late November 2015, reports surfaced stating that "multiple
      acts" would perform during the halftime show. On December 3, the league confirmed
      that the show would be headlined by the British rock band Coldplay. On January
      7, 2016, Pepsi confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé, who headlined
      the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single
      "Hymn for the Weekend" (which was removed from the setlist before the game),
      would be making an appearance. Bruno Mars, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII
      halftime show, and Mark Ronson (Mars''s collaborator on "Uptown Funk") also
      performed.  Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong. Peyton Manning
      completed an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver
      Andre Caldwell. A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards
      to the Panthers 14-yard line, but Carolina''s defense dug in over the next three
      plays. First, linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss.
      Then after an incompletion, Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain
      on third down, forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus
      34-yard field goal. The score marked the first time in the entire postseason
      that Carolina was facing a deficit. After each team punted, Panthers quarterback
      Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass to Jerricho Cotchery, but the
      call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge. CBS analyst
      and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the
      review clearly showed the pass was complete. Two plays later, on 3rd-and-10
      from the 15-yard line, linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton''s
      hands while sacking him, and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for
      a Broncos touchdown, giving the team a 10–0 lead. This was the first fumble
      return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993
      season.  After a punt from both teams, Carolina got on track with a 9-play,
      73-yard scoring drive. Newton completed all four of his pass attempts for 51
      yards and rushed twice for 25 yards, while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive
      with a 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the
      second quarter. Later on, Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman''s
      short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players, but none of them attempted
      to make a tackle, apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch. Norwood
      had not done so, and with no resistance around him, he took off for a Super
      Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers
      14-yard line. Despite Denver''s excellent field position, they could not get
      the ball into the end zone, so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased
      their lead to 13–7.  On Carolina''s next possession, fullback Mike Tolbert lost
      a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart, which linebacker Danny
      Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line. However, the Panthers soon
      took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself
      and then intercepted it, returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard
      line with 1:55 left on the clock. The Panthers could not gain any yards with
      their possession and had to punt. After a Denver punt, Carolina drove to the
      Broncos 45-yard line. But with 11 seconds left and no timeouts left, Newton
      was sacked by DeMarcus Ware causing time for the half to expire.  The Panthers
      seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton
      completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their
      second offensive play. But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard
      line, and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard
      field goal attempt. After the miss, Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel
      Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards, setting up McManus'' 33-yard field goal
      that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead. Carolina got off to another strong start
      after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown. But
      once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced
      off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J. Ward. Ward fumbled
      the ball deep in Denver territory during the return, but Trevathan was able
      to recover the ball enabling Denver to keep possession. There would be no more
      scoring in the third quarter, but early in the fourth, the Broncos drove to
      the Panthers 41-yard line. On the next play, Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning''s
      hand as he was winding up for a pass, and then recovered it for Carolina on
      the 50-yard line. A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by
      Stewart then set up Gano''s 39-yard field goal, cutting the Panthers deficit
      to one score at 16–10. The next three drives of the game would end in punts.  With
      4:51 left in regulation, Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with
      a chance to mount a game-winning drive, and soon faced 3rd-and-9. On the next
      play, Miller stripped the ball away from Newton, and after several players dove
      for it, it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward, who returned
      it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line. Newton was the third player to attempt
      a recovery (following Ware and Mike Remmers) of the ball and while various angles
      appeared to show that he had a decent probability of recovery if he''d dived
      in his attempt, Newton instead hesitated and then tried to drop on top of the
      ball, which failed. This split second decision later earned him criticism. Meanwhile,
      Denver''s offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays, but a holding
      penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs. Then
      Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie
      Fowler for a 2-point conversion, giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and
      essentially putting the game away. Carolina had two more drives and managed
      one first down between them before the game ended.  Manning finished the game
      13 of 23 for 141 yards with one interception, two fumbles, and was sacked 5
      times. Sanders was his top receiver with six receptions for 83 yards. Anderson
      was the game''s leading rusher with 90 yards and a touchdown, along with four
      receptions for 10 yards. Miller had six total tackles (five solo), 2½ sacks,
      and two forced fumbles. Ware had five total tackles and two sacks. Ward had
      seven total tackles, a fumble recovery, and an interception. McManus made all
      four of his field goals, making him perfect on all 11 attempts during the post-season.  Newton
      completed 18 of 41 passes for 265 yards with one interception, two fumbles,
      and was sacked 6 times. He was also his team''s leading rusher with 45 yards
      on six carries. Brown caught four passes for 80 yards, while Ginn had four receptions
      for 74 yards. Ginn was sacked once on a trick play. Ealy was the top defensive
      performer for Carolina with four total tackles, three sacks, a forced fumble,
      a fumble recovery, and an interception. Defensive end Charles Johnson had four
      total tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble. Linebacker Luke Kuechly had 11 total
      tackles and a sack, while Thomas Davis had seven total tackles, despite playing
      just two weeks after breaking his right arm in the NFC title game.  Super Bowl
      50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams. Denver won despite
      being massively outgained in total yards (315 to 194) and first downs (21 to
      11). Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by
      a Super Bowl winning team, as the previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore
      Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. Only seven other teams had ever gained fewer than
      200 yards in a Super Bowl, and all of them had lost. This was the first Super
      Bowl since Super Bowl XXXVI that the winning team scored only a single offensive
      touchdown, although the Broncos defense had earlier in the game scored a touchdown
      from a fumble recovery in the end zone. The Broncos'' seven sacks tied a Super
      Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. Manning was sacked five
      times by the Panthers, giving this game highest total (12) of combined sacks
      in Super Bowl history. Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks,
      and is the only such player to do so and record an interception. Jordan Norwood''s
      61-yard punt return set a new record, surpassing the old record of 45 yards
      set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII. Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down,
      while Carolina was 3-of-15. The two teams'' combined third down conversion percentage
      of 13.8 was the lowest in Super Bowl history. Manning and Newton had quarterback
      passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4, respectively, and their added total of 112
      is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl. Manning became
      the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39, the first quarterback
      ever to win a Super Bowl starting for two different teams, and the first quarterback
      ever to win 200 games (regular season and postseason) as a starter. Gary Kubiak
      became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went
      to the Super Bowl with as a player.  Manning announced his retirement from the
      NFL a month after the Super Bowl. This was also the final game in the career
      of Panthers defensive lineman Jared Allen, who retired as the NFL''s ninth all-time
      leader in sacks.  Completions/attempts<br>Carries<br>Long gain<br>Receptions  Super

    context: ' Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion
      of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season. The American Football
      Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference
      (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to win their third Super Bowl championship.
      The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi''s Stadium in Santa Clara,
      California (located in the San Francisco Bay Area). As this was the 50th Super
      Bowl, the league emphasized the "golden anniversary" with various gold-themed
      initiatives during the 2015 season, as well as suspending the tradition of naming
      each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been
      known as "Super Bowl L"), so the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals
      50.  The Panthers finished the regular season with a 15–1 record, racking up
      the league''s top offense, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most
      Valuable Player (MVP). They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49–15 in the NFC
      Championship Game and advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance since the
      franchise was founded in 1995. The Broncos finished the regular season with
      a 12–4 record, thanks to having the league''s top defense, and despite the struggles
      of starting quarterback Peyton Manning; they defeated the defending Super Bowl
      champion New England Patriots 20–18 in the AFC Championship Game. They joined
      the Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, and Pittsburgh Steelers as one of four teams that
      have made eight appearances in the Super Bowl.  In one of the most defensive
      Super Bowl matchups in NFL history, the Broncos took an early lead in Super
      Bowl 50 and never trailed. Denver recorded seven sacks and forced three turnovers.
      Carolina likewise kept pace by recording five sacks and forcing two turnovers.
      Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super Bowl MVP. This game was also the
      final game of Peyton Manning''s career; he announced his retirement on March
      7, 2016.  CBS'' broadcast of the game was the third most-watched program in
      American television history with an average of 111.9 million viewers. The network
      charged an average of $5 million for a 30-second commercial during the game.
      The Super Bowl 50 halftime show was headlined by Coldplay, with special guest
      performers Beyoncé and Bruno Mars.  In early 2012, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell
      stated that the league planned to make the 50th Super Bowl "spectacular" and
      that it would be "an important game for us as a league".  Cities included in
      early discussions or that submitted bids included:   The league eventually narrowed
      the bids to three sites: New Orleans'' Mercedes-Benz Superdome, Miami''s Sun
      Life Stadium, and the San Francisco Bay Area''s Levi''s Stadium.  The league
      announced on October 16, 2012, that the two finalists were Sun Life Stadium
      and Levi''s Stadium. The South Florida/Miami area has previously hosted the
      event 10 times (tied for most with New Orleans), with the most recent one being
      Super Bowl XLIV in 2010. The San Francisco Bay Area last hosted in 1985 (Super
      Bowl XIX), held at Stanford Stadium in Stanford, California, won by the home
      team 49ers. The Miami bid depended on whether the stadium underwent renovations.
      However, on May 3, 2013, the Florida legislature refused to approve the funding
      plan to pay for the renovations, dealing a significant blow to Miami''s chances.  On
      May 21, 2013, NFL owners at their spring meetings in Boston voted and awarded
      the game to Levi''s Stadium. The $1.2 billion stadium opened in 2014. It is
      the first Super Bowl held in the San Francisco Bay Area since Super Bowl XIX
      in 1985, and the first in California since Super Bowl XXXVII took place in San
      Diego in 2003.  For the third straight season, the number one seeds in the NFC
      and AFC, the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos, met in the Super Bowl. The
      game also featured the league''s top scoring offense (Panthers) against the
      league''s top defense (Broncos). The Panthers became the 10th team since 1960
      to have lost just one game during the regular season, and the sixth team ever
      to have a 15–1 record. It was their second Super Bowl appearance; the other
      was Super Bowl XXXVIII. The Broncos became the fourth team to have eight Super
      Bowl appearances. It was their second appearance in three years, having also
      reached Super Bowl XLVIII. Coincidentally, John Fox was the head coach of each
      team in their previous Super Bowl appearance.  Despite waiving long-time running
      back DeAngelo Williams and losing top wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn
      ACL in the preseason, the Carolina Panthers had their best regular season in
      franchise history, becoming the seventh team to win at least 15 regular season
      games since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in . Carolina started
      the season 14–0, not only setting franchise records for the best start and the
      longest single-season winning streak, but also posting the best start to a season
      by an NFC team in NFL history, breaking the 13–0 record previously shared with
      the 2009 New Orleans Saints and the 2011 Green Bay Packers. With their NFC-best
      15–1 regular season record, the Panthers clinched home-field advantage throughout
      the NFC playoffs for the first time in franchise history. Ten players were selected
      to the Pro Bowl (the most in franchise history) along with eight All-Pro selections.  The
      Panthers'' offense, which led the NFL in scoring (500 points), was loaded with
      talent, boasting six Pro Bowl selections. Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton had
      one of his best seasons, throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 yards,
      while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns (35 passing,
      10 rushing), a career-low 10 interceptions, and a career-best quarterback rating
      of 99.4. Newton''s leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen, who caught a
      career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns, and wide receiver
      Ted Ginn Jr., who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns; Ginn also
      rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards. Other key receivers
      included veteran Jerricho Cotchery (39 receptions for 485 yards), rookie Devin
      Funchess (31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns), and second-year
      receiver Corey Brown (31 receptions for 447 yards). The Panthers'' backfield
      featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart, who led the team with 989 rushing
      yards and six touchdowns in 13 games, along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert,
      who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards. Carolina''s
      offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections: center Ryan Kalil and
      guard Trai Turner.  The Panthers'' defense gave up just 308 points, ranking
      sixth in the league, while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and
      boasting four Pro Bowl selections. Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led
      the team in sacks with 11, while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two.
      Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6½ sacks. The Panthers defensive line also
      featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen, a 5-time Pro Bowl selection, who
      was the NFL''s active career sack leader with 136, along with defensive end
      Kony Ealy, who had five sacks in just nine starts. Behind them, two of the Panthers''
      three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl: Thomas
      Davis and Luke Kuechly. Davis compiled 5½ sacks, four forced fumbles, and four
      interceptions, while Kuechly led the team in tackles (118) forced two fumbles,
      and intercepted four passes of his own. Carolina''s secondary featured Pro Bowl
      safety Kurt Coleman, who led the team with a career high seven interceptions,
      while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman, who developed
      into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions, two of
      which were returned for touchdowns.  After losing in the divisional round of
      the playoffs during three of the previous four seasons, the Denver Broncos''
      general manager John Elway made numerous coaching changes, including a mutual
      parting with head coach John Fox, who had won four divisional championships
      in his four years as Broncos head coach, being replaced in that role by Gary
      Kubiak, Elway''s former backup quarterback and former Broncos offensive coordinator.
      Wade Phillips, a former Broncos head coach, returned to the team to serve his
      second stint as defensive coordinator, succeeding Jack Del Rio who had left
      to take the head coaching vacancy at the Oakland Raiders. The team''s 43–8 loss
      in Super Bowl XLVIII two years earlier, despite holding the regular season''s
      top offense, resulted in Elway signing defensive end DeMarcus Ware, cornerback
      Aqib Talib, safety T. J. Ward, and wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders for the 2014
      season.  Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense
      with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning''s shotgun passing
      style, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line,
      as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year
      with the Indianapolis Colts in , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel
      that he had suffered since the summer. In addition, Manning was getting old,
      as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Though the team had a 7–0 start, Manning
      led the NFL in interceptions. In Week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of
      the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL''s all-time record for
      career passing yards in this game, but after throwing four interceptions, he
      was benched in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as
      the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. After a slow start
      in Denver''s final regular season game against San Diego, Osweiler was benched
      leading to Manning''s return. Manning re-claimed the starting quarterback position
      for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team
      to clinch the AFC''s No. 1 seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips,
      who replaced his predecessor''s complicated read-and-react scheme with a simple
      aggressive approach of attacking the ball, the Broncos'' defense ranked No.
      1 in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous
      three seasons, the team continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise
      records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense,
      the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field
      advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.  Manning finished the year with a career-low
      67.9 passer rating, throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns, with 17 interceptions.
      In contrast, Osweiler threw for 1,967 yards, 10 touchdowns and six interceptions
      for a rating of 86.4. Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105
      receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns, while Emmanuel Sanders caught
      76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores, while adding another 106 yards returning
      punts. Tight end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with
      46 receptions for 517 yards. Running back C. J. Anderson was the team''s leading
      rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns, while also catching 25 passes for 183
      yards. Running back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards, five
      touchdowns, 24 receptions, and a 4.2 yards per carry average. Overall, the offense
      ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections.  The
      Broncos'' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed (4,530) for the first
      time in franchise history, and fourth in points allowed (296). Defensive ends
      Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson each had 5½ sacks. Pro Bowl linebacker Von Miller
      led the team with 11 sacks, forced four fumbles, and recovered three. Linebacker
      DeMarcus Ware was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the ninth time in his
      career, ranking second on the team with 7½ sacks. Linebacker Brandon Marshall
      led the team in total tackles with 109, while Danny Trevathan ranked second
      with 102 tackles. Cornerbacks Aqib Talib (three interceptions) and Chris Harris
      Jr. (two interceptions) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the defense,
      though none of the players selected for the Pro Bowl participated due to the
      Broncos reaching Super Bowl 50.  The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the
      divisional round, running up a 31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious
      second half comeback attempt to win 31–24, avenging their elimination from a
      year earlier. The Panthers then blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship
      Game, 49–15, racking up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers.  The Broncos
      defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round, 23–16, by scoring
      11 points in the final three minutes of the game. They then defeated the defending
      Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game,
      20–18, by intercepting a pass on New England''s 2-point conversion attempt with
      17 seconds left on the clock and recovering a subsequent onside kick attempt.  Carolina
      suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis, an 11-year veteran who had already
      overcome three ACL tears in his career, went down with a broken arm in the NFC
      Championship Game. Despite this, he insisted he would still find a way to play
      in the Super Bowl. His prediction turned out to be accurate and he made it into
      the starting lineup.  Peyton Manning reached his fourth Super Bowl, with appearances
      under as many head coaches (Tony Dungy, Jim Caldwell, John Fox and Gary Kubiak).
      He became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple
      Super Bowls. He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl
      at age 39. The past record was held by John Elway, who led the Broncos to victory
      in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver''s Executive Vice President
      of Football Operations and General Manager.  Manning and Newton set the record
      for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13
      years and 48 days (Manning was 39, Newton was 26). In addition, this was the
      first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the #1 pick
      in their draft classes. Manning was the #1 selection of the 1998 NFL Draft,
      while Newton was picked first in 2011. The matchup also pits the top two picks
      of the 2011 draft against each other: Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for
      Denver.  With Ron Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in
      Super Bowl XX, and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos'' defeats
      in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV, this was the first Super Bowl in which both head
      coaches played in the game themselves; coincidentally, the coaches they had
      played under, Mike Ditka (Rivera) and Dan Reeves (Kubiak), not only had Super
      Bowl playing experience themselves, but had done so as teammates with the Dallas
      Cowboys in Super Bowls V and VI (and worked together as Cowboys assistant coaches
      for Super Bowls X, XII and XIII).  Concerns were raised over whether Levi''s
      Stadium''s field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl; during the
      inaugural season, the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various
      issues, and earlier in the 2015 season, a portion of the turf collapsed under
      Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, causing him to slip and miss a field
      goal, although the field has not had any major issues since. As is customary
      for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums, the NFL re-sodded the
      hybrid Bermuda 419 turf playing surface prior to the game; NFL and Atlanta Braves
      field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in "great shape" for the
      game. However, the turf showed problems throughout the game, with a number of
      players needing to change their cleats during the game and players slipping
      during plays all throughout the game.  As the designated home team in the annual
      rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Broncos elected to wear their road white
      jerseys with matching white pants. Elway stated, "We''ve had Super Bowl success
      in our white uniforms." The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants
      in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII, Elway''s last game as Denver QB, when
      they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19. In their only other Super Bowl win
      in Super Bowl XXXII, Denver wore blue jerseys, which was their primary color
      at the time. They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys, but
      they are 0–4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys, losing in Super Bowl
      XII, XXII, XXIV, and XLVIII. The only other AFC champion team to have worn white
      as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers; they
      defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior. The Broncos''
      decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform:
      black jerseys with silver pants.  The Panthers used the San Jose State practice
      facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott. The Broncos practiced at Stanford
      University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott.  On June 4, 2014, the NFL
      announced that the game would be branded with Arabic numerals as "Super Bowl
      50"—rather than with Roman numerals, a practice established at Super Bowl V
      under which the game would have been known as "Super Bowl L". NFL creative director
      Shandon Melvin, explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty
      in designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter "L" using the standardized
      logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV. He noted that "L" was harder to
      design around as it is asymmetrical unlike other Roman numerals, and also showed
      concerns that use of the letter "L" could be interpreted as the "loser" hand
      gesture. 73 different mockups, incorporating either "L" or "50", were designed
      before the final design was chosen, which featured large numerals colored in
      gold behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead of underneath and in silver as
      in the standard logo.  Tying into the game''s "golden anniversary," various
      gold-themed promotions and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season.
      The league adopted a gold-tinted logo, which was implemented across all of the
      NFL''s properties and painted on fields during the season. The numbering of
      the 50-yard line on fields was colored gold, and beginning on week 7, all sideline
      jackets and hats featured gold-trimmed logos. Gold footballs were given to each
      high school that has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl, and "homecoming"
      events were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games.  Ten themed "50"
      statues were placed in locations across San Francisco to promote the game; however,
      due to the negativity towards the game by residents of the city, the statues
      notably became the target of vandals, with the "SUPER BOWL 50" lettering on
      their bases re-arranged to form other phrases such as "SUPERB OWL", "SUP BRO
      50", and after the Alamo Square statue was toppled, "OOPS".  The annual NFL
      Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. In addition, "Super
      Bowl City" opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero, featuring
      games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area''s technology, culinary
      creations, and cultural diversity. More than a million people are expected to
      attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week. San Francisco
      mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area "they
      are going to have to leave". San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully
      lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount
      of $5 million.  In addition, there are $2 million worth of other ancillary events,
      including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center, a beer, wine
      and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University, and a pep rally.
      A professional fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual
      donors, but still may need the city council to help fund the event. Additional
      funding will be provided by the city council, which has announced plans to set
      aside seed funding for the event.  The game''s media day, which was typically
      held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game, was moved to the Monday evening
      and re-branded as "Super Bowl Opening Night". The event was held on February
      1, 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose. Alongside the traditional media availabilities,
      the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica
      of the Golden Gate Bridge.  For the first time, the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee
      and the NFL have openly sought disabled veteran and lesbian, gay, bisexual and
      transgender-owned businesses in Business Connect, the Super Bowl program that
      provides local companies with contracting opportunities in and around the Super
      Bowl. The host committee has already raised over $40 million through sponsors
      including Apple, Google, Yahoo!, Intel, Gap, Chevron, and Dignity Health.  The
      Super Bowl 50 Host Committee has vowed to be "the most giving Super Bowl ever",
      and will dedicate 25 percent of all money it raises for philanthropic causes
      in the Bay Area. The committee created the 50 fund as its philanthropic initiative
      and focuses on providing grants to aid with youth development, community investment
      and sustainable environments.  In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that
      all Super Bowl champions receive, the winning team also received a large, 18-karat
      gold-plated "50". Each digit weighs for a total of . Like the Lombardi Trophy,
      the "50" was designed by Tiffany & Co.  After putting out a call for volunteers
      in June 2015, over 450 volunteers helped to make the Super Bowl 50 Tour happen.
      More than 5,000 volunteers were on hand to help with events leading up to, during
      and after Super Bowl 50 as well. Volunteers signed up for a minimum of 3–4 hour
      shifts, and some volunteers gave more than 200 hours of their time over the
      course of the week. As a thank you for volunteering, volunteers were gifted
      backpacks and uniforms.  In the United States, the game was televised by CBS,
      as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the
      NFL. The network''s lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the
      contest, with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines. CBS introduced
      new features during the telecast, including pylon cameras and microphones along
      with "EyeVision 360"—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be
      used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and "bullet time" effects. (An earlier
      version of "EyeVision" was last used in Super Bowl XXXV; for Super Bowl 50,
      the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution.) CBS provided digital streams of
      the game via CBSSports.com, and the CBS Sports apps on tablets, Windows 10,
      Xbox One and other digital media players (such as Chromecast and Roku). Due
      to Verizon Communications exclusivity, streaming on smartphones was only provided
      to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service.  On December 28, 2015,
      ESPN announced that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to provide
      a dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of Super Bowl 50, airing on ESPN Deportes
      and streaming on WatchESPN, featuring commentary and surrounding coverage in
      the language; unlike Fox and NBC, CBS does not have a Spanish-language cable
      network that could have carried such a broadcast. The production utilized CBS''s
      video, but with Spanish-language graphics provided by ESPN, and its "Monday
      Night Football" commentary crew of Alvaro Martin, Raul Allegre, and sideline
      reporter John Sutcliffe. ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game and post-game coverage,
      while Martin, Allegre, and Sutcliffe also contributed reports for the English-language
      ESPN as part of efforts to promote the simulcast. ESPN Deportes'' vice president
      of programming Freddy Rolon felt that dedicated Spanish-language coverage appealed
      better to Hispanic viewers than Spanish commentary on the SAP audio channel,
      going on to say that "I have family members who watch Spanish language television
      and they don''t know where that SAP button is to begin with".  As opposed to
      broadcasts of primetime series, CBS broadcast special episodes of its late-night
      talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50, beginning with a special
      episode of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" following the game. Following
      a break for late local programming, CBS also aired a special episode of "The
      Late Late Show with James Corden".  With an average TV audience of 111.9 million,
      the game was the third most-watched Super Bowl—and third most-watched U.S. program—in
      history, according to the Nielsen ratings. It was also the most-watched program
      of all-time in terms of total audience, 167-million, which measures those who
      viewed at least six minutes of the broadcast. Average viewership is the industry
      standard for determining television ratings, while total audience is a supplemental
      metric. The Spanish-language broadcast on ESPN Deportes was seen by an average
      of 472,000 viewers; it ranked behind Super Bowl XLVIII as the second-most-watched
      Spanish-language cable telecast in U.S. history, outside of soccer games.  CBS
      set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $5,000,000, a record high
      price for a Super Bowl ad. As of January 26, the advertisements had not yet
      sold out. CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time
      on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game, meaning that for
      the first time, digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising
      in pattern with the television broadcast. This would be the final year in a
      multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer
      to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount. It was also
      the final year that Doritos, a longtime sponsor of the game, held its "Crash
      the Super Bowl" contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads
      for a chance to have it aired during the game. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company
      also made their Super Bowl debut, Hyundai placed in both first and fifth place
      respectively on "USA Today"s Super Bowl Ad Meter survey, with their ads "First
      Date" (for the Hyundai Genesis) and "Ryanville" (for the 2017 Hyundai Elantra).  First-time
      advertisers at Super Bowl 50 included Amazon.com, Colgate toothpaste, Death
      Wish Coffee (who beat 10 other small businesses in a contest held by Intuit,
      who paid for the ad time as a prize), LG Electronics, Marmot, Nintendo (promoting
      the 20th anniversary of the "Pokémon" franchise), PayPal, and SoFi.  20th Century
      Fox, Lionsgate, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios and Walt Disney Studios
      paid for movie trailers to be aired during the Super Bowl. Fox paid for "Deadpool",
      "", "" and "Eddie the Eagle", Lionsgate paid for "Gods of Egypt", Paramount
      paid for "" and "10 Cloverfield Lane", Universal paid for "The Secret Life of
      Pets" and the debut trailer for "Jason Bourne" and Disney paid for "", "The
      Jungle Book" and "Alice Through the Looking Glass".  Westwood One carried the
      game throughout North America, with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer,
      Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts, and James Lofton and Mark Malone
      as sideline reporters. Jim Gray anchored the pre-game and halftime coverage.  The
      flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team carried their
      local play-by-play calls. In Denver, KOA (850 AM) and KRFX (103.5 FM) carried
      the game, with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary.
      In North Carolina, WBT (1110 AM) carried the game, with Mick Mixon on play-by-play
      and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary. WBT also simulcast the
      game on its sister station WBT-FM (99.3 FM), based in Chester, South Carolina.
      As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations, the local broadcasts were audible
      over much of the western United States after sunset (for Denver) and the eastern
      United States throughout the game (for Carolina). In accordance with contractual
      rules, the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks either
      carried the Westwood One feed or did not air the game at all.  In the United
      Kingdom, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra carried the contest. As in
      previous years, the BBC aired its own commercial-free British English broadcast,
      with Greg Brady, Darren Fletcher and Rocky Boiman on commentary.  In honor of
      the 50th Super Bowl, the pregame ceremony featured the on-field introduction
      of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players. Bart Starr (MVP of
      Super Bowls I and II) and Chuck Howley (MVP of Super Bowl V) appeared via video.
      The late Harvey Martin, co-MVP of Super Bowl XII who died in 2001, was acknowledged
      when the other co-MVP of Super Bowl XII, Randy White, was introduced. Peyton
      Manning (MVP of Super Bowl XLI and the Broncos'' starting quarterback for the
      game) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game. This ceremony continued
      a ten-year tradition (starting with Super Bowl XX and then repeated in Super
      Bowl XXX and Super Bowl XL) in which past Super Bowl MVPs were honored before
      the game.  Lady Gaga sang the national anthem, while Marlee Matlin simultaneously
      performed an American Sign Language (ASL) version of it. Matlin also signed
      an a cappella version of "America the Beautiful", which was sung by a U.S. Armed
      Forces chorus.  In late November 2015, reports surfaced stating that "multiple
      acts" would perform during the halftime show. On December 3, the league confirmed
      that the show would be headlined by the British rock band Coldplay. On January
      7, 2016, Pepsi confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé, who headlined
      the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single
      "Hymn for the Weekend" (which was removed from the setlist before the game),
      would be making an appearance. Bruno Mars, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII
      halftime show, and Mark Ronson (Mars''s collaborator on "Uptown Funk") also
      performed.  Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong. Peyton Manning
      completed an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver
      Andre Caldwell. A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards
      to the Panthers 14-yard line, but Carolina''s defense dug in over the next three
      plays. First, linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss.
      Then after an incompletion, Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain
      on third down, forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus
      34-yard field goal. The score marked the first time in the entire postseason
      that Carolina was facing a deficit. After each team punted, Panthers quarterback
      Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass to Jerricho Cotchery, but the
      call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge. CBS analyst
      and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the
      review clearly showed the pass was complete. Two plays later, on 3rd-and-10
      from the 15-yard line, linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton''s
      hands while sacking him, and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for
      a Broncos touchdown, giving the team a 10–0 lead. This was the first fumble
      return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993
      season.  After a punt from both teams, Carolina got on track with a 9-play,
      73-yard scoring drive. Newton completed all four of his pass attempts for 51
      yards and rushed twice for 25 yards, while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive
      with a 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the
      second quarter. Later on, Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman''s
      short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players, but none of them attempted
      to make a tackle, apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch. Norwood
      had not done so, and with no resistance around him, he took off for a Super
      Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers
      14-yard line. Despite Denver''s excellent field position, they could not get
      the ball into the end zone, so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased
      their lead to 13–7.  On Carolina''s next possession, fullback Mike Tolbert lost
      a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart, which linebacker Danny
      Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line. However, the Panthers soon
      took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself
      and then intercepted it, returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard
      line with 1:55 left on the clock. The Panthers could not gain any yards with
      their possession and had to punt. After a Denver punt, Carolina drove to the
      Broncos 45-yard line. But with 11 seconds left and no timeouts left, Newton
      was sacked by DeMarcus Ware causing time for the half to expire.  The Panthers
      seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton
      completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their
      second offensive play. But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard
      line, and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard
      field goal attempt. After the miss, Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel
      Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards, setting up McManus'' 33-yard field goal
      that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead. Carolina got off to another strong start
      after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown. But
      once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced
      off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J. Ward. Ward fumbled
      the ball deep in Denver territory during the return, but Trevathan was able
      to recover the ball enabling Denver to keep possession. There would be no more
      scoring in the third quarter, but early in the fourth, the Broncos drove to
      the Panthers 41-yard line. On the next play, Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning''s
      hand as he was winding up for a pass, and then recovered it for Carolina on
      the 50-yard line. A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by
      Stewart then set up Gano''s 39-yard field goal, cutting the Panthers deficit
      to one score at 16–10. The next three drives of the game would end in punts.  With
      4:51 left in regulation, Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with
      a chance to mount a game-winning drive, and soon faced 3rd-and-9. On the next
      play, Miller stripped the ball away from Newton, and after several players dove
      for it, it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward, who returned
      it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line. Newton was the third player to attempt
      a recovery (following Ware and Mike Remmers) of the ball and while various angles
      appeared to show that he had a decent probability of recovery if he''d dived
      in his attempt, Newton instead hesitated and then tried to drop on top of the
      ball, which failed. This split second decision later earned him criticism. Meanwhile,
      Denver''s offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays, but a holding
      penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs. Then
      Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie
      Fowler for a 2-point conversion, giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and
      essentially putting the game away. Carolina had two more drives and managed
      one first down between them before the game ended.  Manning finished the game
      13 of 23 for 141 yards with one interception, two fumbles, and was sacked 5
      times. Sanders was his top receiver with six receptions for 83 yards. Anderson
      was the game''s leading rusher with 90 yards and a touchdown, along with four
      receptions for 10 yards. Miller had six total tackles (five solo), 2½ sacks,
      and two forced fumbles. Ware had five total tackles and two sacks. Ward had
      seven total tackles, a fumble recovery, and an interception. McManus made all
      four of his field goals, making him perfect on all 11 attempts during the post-season.  Newton
      completed 18 of 41 passes for 265 yards with one interception, two fumbles,
      and was sacked 6 times. He was also his team''s leading rusher with 45 yards
      on six carries. Brown caught four passes for 80 yards, while Ginn had four receptions
      for 74 yards. Ginn was sacked once on a trick play. Ealy was the top defensive
      performer for Carolina with four total tackles, three sacks, a forced fumble,
      a fumble recovery, and an interception. Defensive end Charles Johnson had four
      total tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble. Linebacker Luke Kuechly had 11 total
      tackles and a sack, while Thomas Davis had seven total tackles, despite playing
      just two weeks after breaking his right arm in the NFC title game.  Super Bowl
      50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams. Denver won despite
      being massively outgained in total yards (315 to 194) and first downs (21 to
      11). Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by
      a Super Bowl winning team, as the previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore
      Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. Only seven other teams had ever gained fewer than
      200 yards in a Super Bowl, and all of them had lost. This was the first Super
      Bowl since Super Bowl XXXVI that the winning team scored only a single offensive
      touchdown, although the Broncos defense had earlier in the game scored a touchdown
      from a fumble recovery in the end zone. The Broncos'' seven sacks tied a Super
      Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. Manning was sacked five
      times by the Panthers, giving this game highest total (12) of combined sacks
      in Super Bowl history. Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks,
      and is the only such player to do so and record an interception. Jordan Norwood''s
      61-yard punt return set a new record, surpassing the old record of 45 yards
      set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII. Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down,
      while Carolina was 3-of-15. The two teams'' combined third down conversion percentage
      of 13.8 was the lowest in Super Bowl history. Manning and Newton had quarterback
      passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4, respectively, and their added total of 112
      is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl. Manning became
      the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39, the first quarterback
      ever to win a Super Bowl starting for two different teams, and the first quarterback
      ever to win 200 games (regular season and postseason) as a starter. Gary Kubiak
      became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went
      to the Super Bowl with as a player.  Manning announced his retirement from the
      NFL a month after the Super Bowl. This was also the final game in the career
      of Panthers defensive lineman Jared Allen, who retired as the NFL''s ninth all-time
      leader in sacks.  Completions/attempts<br>Carries<br>Long gain<br>Receptions  Super

      the Minnesota Vikings and Kansas City Chiefs held a rematch of Super Bowl IV
      to kick off the post-merger era of the NFL. The Broncos prevailed 21-20 as Carolina
      missed a field goal attempt to end the game. '

      the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard
      logo.
    - Tying into the game's "golden anniversary," various gold-themed promotions and
      initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season.
    - The league adopted a gold-tinted logo, which was implemented across all of the
      NFL's properties and painted on fields during the season.
    - The numbering of the 50-yard line on fields was colored gold, and beginning
