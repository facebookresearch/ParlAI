      Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the
      National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season. The American Football Conference
      (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference (NFC)
      champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to win their third Super Bowl championship.
      The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi''s Stadium in Santa Clara,
      California (located in the San Francisco Bay Area). As this was the 50th Super
      Bowl, the league emphasized the "golden anniversary" with various gold-themed
      initiatives during the 2015 season, as well as suspending the tradition of naming
      each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been
      known as "Super Bowl L"), so the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals
      50.


      The Panthers finished the regular season with a 15–1 record, racking up the
      league''s top offense, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable
      Player (MVP). They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49–15 in the NFC Championship
      Game and advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance since the franchise
      was founded in 1995. The Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record,
      thanks to having the league''s top defense, and despite the struggles of starting
      quarterback Peyton Manning; they defeated the defending Super Bowl champion
      New England Patriots 20–18 in the AFC Championship Game. They joined the Patriots,
      Dallas Cowboys, and Pittsburgh Steelers as one of four teams that have made
      eight appearances in the Super Bowl.


      In one of the most defensive Super Bowl matchups in NFL history, the Broncos
      took an early lead in Super Bowl 50 and never trailed. Denver recorded seven
      sacks and forced three turnovers. Carolina likewise kept pace by recording five
      sacks and forcing two turnovers. Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super
      Bowl MVP. This game was also the final game of Peyton Manning''s career; he
      announced his retirement on March 7, 2016.


      CBS'' broadcast of the game was the third most-watched program in American television
      history with an average of 111.9 million viewers. The network charged an average
      of $5 million for a 30-second commercial during the game. The Super Bowl 50
      halftime show was headlined by Coldplay, with special guest performers Beyoncé
      and Bruno Mars.


      In early 2012, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the league planned
      to make the 50th Super Bowl "spectacular" and that it would be "an important
      game for us as a league".


      Cities included in early discussions or that submitted bids included:



      The league eventually narrowed the bids to three sites: New Orleans'' Mercedes-Benz
      Superdome, Miami''s Sun Life Stadium, and the San Francisco Bay Area''s Levi''s
      Stadium.


      The league announced on October 16, 2012, that the two finalists were Sun Life
      Stadium and Levi''s Stadium. The South Florida/Miami area has previously hosted
      the event 10 times (tied for most with New Orleans), with the most recent one
      being Super Bowl XLIV in 2010. The San Francisco Bay Area last hosted in 1985
      (Super Bowl XIX), held at Stanford Stadium in Stanford, California, won by the
      home team 49ers. The Miami bid depended on whether the stadium underwent renovations.
      However, on May 3, 2013, the Florida legislature refused to approve the funding
      plan to pay for the renovations, dealing a significant blow to Miami''s chances.


      On May 21, 2013, NFL owners at their spring meetings in Boston voted and awarded
      the game to Levi''s Stadium. The $1.2 billion stadium opened in 2014. It is
      the first Super Bowl held in the San Francisco Bay Area since Super Bowl XIX
      in 1985, and the first in California since Super Bowl XXXVII took place in San
      Diego in 2003.


      For the third straight season, the number one seeds in the NFC and AFC, the
      Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos, met in the Super Bowl. The game also featured
      the league''s top scoring offense (Panthers) against the league''s top defense
      (Broncos). The Panthers became the 10th team since 1960 to have lost just one
      game during the regular season, and the sixth team ever to have a 15–1 record.
      It was their second Super Bowl appearance; the other was Super Bowl XXXVIII.
      The Broncos became the fourth team to have eight Super Bowl appearances. It
      was their second appearance in three years, having also reached Super Bowl XLVIII.
      Coincidentally, John Fox was the head coach of each team in their previous Super
      Bowl appearance.


      Despite waiving long-time running back DeAngelo Williams and losing top wide
      receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn ACL in the preseason, the Carolina Panthers
      had their best regular season in franchise history, becoming the seventh team
      to win at least 15 regular season games since the league expanded to a 16-game
      schedule in . Carolina started the season 14–0, not only setting franchise records
      for the best start and the longest single-season winning streak, but also posting
      the best start to a season by an NFC team in NFL history, breaking the 13–0
      record previously shared with the 2009 New Orleans Saints and the 2011 Green
      Bay Packers. With their NFC-best 15–1 regular season record, the Panthers clinched
      home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs for the first time in franchise
      history. Ten players were selected to the Pro Bowl (the most in franchise history)
      along with eight All-Pro selections.


      The Panthers'' offense, which led the NFL in scoring (500 points), was loaded
      with talent, boasting six Pro Bowl selections. Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton
      had one of his best seasons, throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 yards,
      while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns (35 passing,
      10 rushing), a career-low 10 interceptions, and a career-best quarterback rating
      of 99.4. Newton''s leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen, who caught a
      career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns, and wide receiver
      Ted Ginn Jr., who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns; Ginn also
      rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards. Other key receivers
      included veteran Jerricho Cotchery (39 receptions for 485 yards), rookie Devin
      Funchess (31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns), and second-year
      receiver Corey Brown (31 receptions for 447 yards). The Panthers'' backfield
      featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart, who led the team with 989 rushing
      yards and six touchdowns in 13 games, along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert,
      who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards. Carolina''s
      offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections: center Ryan Kalil and
      guard Trai Turner.


      The Panthers'' defense gave up just 308 points, ranking sixth in the league,
      while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl
      selections. Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with
      11, while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two. Fellow lineman Mario
      Addison added 6½ sacks. The Panthers defensive line also featured veteran defensive
      end Jared Allen, a 5-time Pro Bowl selection, who was the NFL''s active career
      sack leader with 136, along with defensive end Kony Ealy, who had five sacks
      in just nine starts. Behind them, two of the Panthers'' three starting linebackers
      were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl: Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly. Davis
      compiled 5½ sacks, four forced fumbles, and four interceptions, while Kuechly
      led the team in tackles (118) forced two fumbles, and intercepted four passes
      of his own. Carolina''s secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman, who
      led the team with a career high seven interceptions, while also racking up 88
      tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman, who developed into a shutdown corner
      during the season and had four interceptions, two of which were returned for
      touchdowns.


      After losing in the divisional round of the playoffs during three of the previous
      four seasons, the Denver Broncos'' general manager John Elway made numerous
      coaching changes, including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox, who had
      won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach, being
      replaced in that role by Gary Kubiak, Elway''s former backup quarterback and
      former Broncos offensive coordinator. Wade Phillips, a former Broncos head coach,
      returned to the team to serve his second stint as defensive coordinator, succeeding
      Jack Del Rio who had left to take the head coaching vacancy at the Oakland Raiders.
      The team''s 43–8 loss in Super Bowl XLVIII two years earlier, despite holding
      the regular season''s top offense, resulted in Elway signing defensive end DeMarcus
      Ware, cornerback Aqib Talib, safety T. J. Ward, and wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders
      for the 2014 season.


      Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone
      blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning''s shotgun passing style,
      but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well
      as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the
      Indianapolis Colts in , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he
      had suffered since the summer. In addition, Manning was getting old, as he turned
      39 in the 2015 off-season. Though the team had a 7–0 start, Manning led the
      NFL in interceptions. In Week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar
      fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL''s all-time record for career passing
      yards in this game, but after throwing four interceptions, he was benched in
      favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for
      most of the remainder of the regular season. After a slow start in Denver''s
      final regular season game against San Diego, Osweiler was benched leading to
      Manning''s return. Manning re-claimed the starting quarterback position for
      the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to
      clinch the AFC''s No. 1 seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, who
      replaced his predecessor''s complicated read-and-react scheme with a simple
      aggressive approach of attacking the ball, the Broncos'' defense ranked No.
      1 in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous
      three seasons, the team continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise
      records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense,
      the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field
      advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.


      Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating, throwing for
      2,249 yards and nine touchdowns, with 17 interceptions. In contrast, Osweiler
      threw for 1,967 yards, 10 touchdowns and six interceptions for a rating of 86.4.
      Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105 receptions for 1,304
      yards and six touchdowns, while Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes for 1,135
      yards and six scores, while adding another 106 yards returning punts. Tight
      end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions
      for 517 yards. Running back C. J. Anderson was the team''s leading rusher 863
      yards and seven touchdowns, while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards. Running
      back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards, five touchdowns,
      24 receptions, and a 4.2 yards per carry average. Overall, the offense ranked
      19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections.


      The Broncos'' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed (4,530) for the
      first time in franchise history, and fourth in points allowed (296). Defensive
      ends Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson each had 5½ sacks. Pro Bowl linebacker Von
      Miller led the team with 11 sacks, forced four fumbles, and recovered three.
      Linebacker DeMarcus Ware was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the ninth
      time in his career, ranking second on the team with 7½ sacks. Linebacker Brandon
      Marshall led the team in total tackles with 109, while Danny Trevathan ranked
      second with 102 tackles. Cornerbacks Aqib Talib (three interceptions) and Chris
      Harris Jr. (two interceptions) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the
      defense, though none of the players selected for the Pro Bowl participated due
      to the Broncos reaching Super Bowl 50.


      The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round, running up a
      31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious second half comeback attempt
      to win 31–24, avenging their elimination from a year earlier. The Panthers then
      blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game, 49–15, racking
      up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers.


      The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round, 23–16,
      by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game. They then defeated
      the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship
      Game, 20–18, by intercepting a pass on New England''s 2-point conversion attempt
      with 17 seconds left on the clock and recovering a subsequent onside kick attempt.


      Carolina suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis, an 11-year veteran who
      had already overcome three ACL tears in his career, went down with a broken
      arm in the NFC Championship Game. Despite this, he insisted he would still find
      a way to play in the Super Bowl. His prediction turned out to be accurate and
      he made it into the starting lineup.


      Peyton Manning reached his fourth Super Bowl, with appearances under as many
      head coaches (Tony Dungy, Jim Caldwell, John Fox and Gary Kubiak). He became
      the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls.
      He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39. The
      past record was held by John Elway, who led the Broncos to victory in Super
      Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver''s Executive Vice President of
      Football Operations and General Manager.


      Manning and Newton set the record for the largest age difference between opposing
      Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days (Manning was 39, Newton was
      26). In addition, this was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on
      both teams who was the #1 pick in their draft classes. Manning was the #1 selection
      of the 1998 NFL Draft, while Newton was picked first in 2011. The matchup also
      pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other: Newton for Carolina
      and Von Miller for Denver.


      With Ron Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl
      XX, and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos'' defeats in Super
      Bowls XXI and XXIV, this was the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches
      played in the game themselves; coincidentally, the coaches they had played under,
      Mike Ditka (Rivera) and Dan Reeves (Kubiak), not only had Super Bowl playing
      experience themselves, but had done so as teammates with the Dallas Cowboys
      in Super Bowls V and VI (and worked together as Cowboys assistant coaches for
      Super Bowls X, XII and XIII).


      Concerns were raised over whether Levi''s Stadium''s field was of a high enough
      quality to host a Super Bowl; during the inaugural season, the field had to
      be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues, and earlier in the 2015 season,
      a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker,
      causing him to slip and miss a field goal, although the field has not had any
      major issues since. As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass
      stadiums, the NFL re-sodded the hybrid Bermuda 419 turf playing surface prior
      to the game; NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the
      field was in "great shape" for the game. However, the turf showed problems throughout
      the game, with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the
      game and players slipping during plays all throughout the game.


      As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams,
      the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants.
      Elway stated, "We''ve had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms." The Broncos
      last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII,
      Elway''s last game as Denver QB, when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19.
      In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII, Denver wore blue jerseys,
      which was their primary color at the time. They also lost Super Bowl XXI when
      they wore white jerseys, but they are 0–4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange
      jerseys, losing in Super Bowl XII, XXII, XXIV, and XLVIII. The only other AFC
      champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl
      was the Pittsburgh Steelers; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super
      Bowl XL 10 seasons prior. The Broncos'' decision to wear white meant the Panthers
      would wear their standard home uniform: black jerseys with silver pants.


      The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San
      Jose Marriott. The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the
      Santa Clara Marriott.


      On June 4, 2014, the NFL announced that the game would be branded with Arabic
      numerals as "Super Bowl 50"—rather than with Roman numerals, a practice established
      at Super Bowl V under which the game would have been known as "Super Bowl L".
      NFL creative director Shandon Melvin, explained that a primary reason for the
      change was the difficulty in designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the
      letter "L" using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV.
      He noted that "L" was harder to design around as it is asymmetrical unlike other
      Roman numerals, and also showed concerns that use of the letter "L" could be
      interpreted as the "loser" hand gesture. 73 different mockups, incorporating
      either "L" or "50", were designed before the final design was chosen, which
      featured large numerals colored in gold behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead
      of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo.


      Tying into the game''s "golden anniversary," various gold-themed promotions
      and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season. The league adopted
      a gold-tinted logo, which was implemented across all of the NFL''s properties
      and painted on fields during the season. The numbering of the 50-yard line on
      fields was colored gold, and beginning on week 7, all sideline jackets and hats
      featured gold-trimmed logos. Gold footballs were given to each high school that
      has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl, and "homecoming" events
      were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games.


      Ten themed "50" statues were placed in locations across San Francisco to promote
      the game; however, due to the negativity towards the game by residents of the
      city, the statues notably became the target of vandals, with the "SUPER BOWL
      50" lettering on their bases re-arranged to form other phrases such as "SUPERB
      OWL", "SUP BRO 50", and after the Alamo Square statue was toppled, "OOPS".


      The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. In
      addition, "Super Bowl City" opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The
      Embarcadero, featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area''s
      technology, culinary creations, and cultural diversity. More than a million
      people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super
      Bowl Week. San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence
      in this area "they are going to have to leave". San Francisco city supervisor
      Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city
      services in the amount of $5 million.


      In addition, there are $2 million worth of other ancillary events, including
      a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center, a beer, wine and food
      festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University, and a pep rally. A professional
      fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual donors, but
      still may need the city council to help fund the event. Additional funding will
      be provided by the city council, which has announced plans to set aside seed
      funding for the event.


      The game''s media day, which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior
      to the game, was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as "Super Bowl Opening
      Night". The event was held on February 1, 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose. Alongside
      the traditional media availabilities, the event featured an opening ceremony
      with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge.


      For the first time, the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL have openly
      sought disabled veteran and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-owned businesses
      in Business Connect, the Super Bowl program that provides local companies with
      contracting opportunities in and around the Super Bowl. The host committee has
      already raised over $40 million through sponsors including Apple, Google, Yahoo!,
      Intel, Gap, Chevron, and Dignity Health.


      The Super Bowl 50 Host Committee has vowed to be "the most giving Super Bowl
      ever", and will dedicate 25 percent of all money it raises for philanthropic
      causes in the Bay Area. The committee created the 50 fund as its philanthropic
      initiative and focuses on providing grants to aid with youth development, community
      investment and sustainable environments.


      In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that all Super Bowl champions receive,
      the winning team also received a large, 18-karat gold-plated "50". Each digit
      weighs for a total of . Like the Lombardi Trophy, the "50" was designed by Tiffany
      & Co.


      After putting out a call for volunteers in June 2015, over 450 volunteers helped
      to make the Super Bowl 50 Tour happen. More than 5,000 volunteers were on hand
      to help with events leading up to, during and after Super Bowl 50 as well. Volunteers
      signed up for a minimum of 3–4 hour shifts, and some volunteers gave more than
      200 hours of their time over the course of the week. As a thank you for volunteering,
      volunteers were gifted backpacks and uniforms.


      In the United States, the game was televised by CBS, as part of a cycle between
      the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL. The network''s lead
      broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest, with Tracy Wolfson
      and Evan Washburn on the sidelines. CBS introduced new features during the telecast,
      including pylon cameras and microphones along with "EyeVision 360"—an array
      of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree
      view of plays and "bullet time" effects. (An earlier version of "EyeVision"
      was last used in Super Bowl XXXV; for Super Bowl 50, the cameras were upgraded
      to 5K resolution.) CBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com,
      and the CBS Sports apps on tablets, Windows 10, Xbox One and other digital media
      players (such as Chromecast and Roku). Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity,
      streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via
      the NFL Mobile service.


      On December 28, 2015, ESPN announced that they had reached an agreement with
      CBS and the NFL to provide a dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of Super Bowl
      50, airing on ESPN Deportes and streaming on WatchESPN, featuring commentary
      and surrounding coverage in the language; unlike Fox and NBC, CBS does not have
      a Spanish-language cable network that could have carried such a broadcast. The
      production utilized CBS''s video, but with Spanish-language graphics provided
      by ESPN, and its "Monday Night Football" commentary crew of Alvaro Martin, Raul
      Allegre, and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe. ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game
      and post-game coverage, while Martin, Allegre, and Sutcliffe also contributed
      reports for the English-language ESPN as part of efforts to promote the simulcast.
      ESPN Deportes'' vice president of programming Freddy Rolon felt that dedicated
      Spanish-language coverage appealed better to Hispanic viewers than Spanish commentary
      on the SAP audio channel, going on to say that "I have family members who watch
      Spanish language television and they don''t know where that SAP button is to
      begin with".


      As opposed to broadcasts of primetime series, CBS broadcast special episodes
      of its late-night talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50, beginning
      with a special episode of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" following the
      game. Following a break for late local programming, CBS also aired a special
      episode of "The Late Late Show with James Corden".


      With an average TV audience of 111.9 million, the game was the third most-watched
      Super Bowl—and third most-watched U.S. program—in history, according to the
      Nielsen ratings. It was also the most-watched program of all-time in terms of
      total audience, 167-million, which measures those who viewed at least six minutes
      of the broadcast. Average viewership is the industry standard for determining
      television ratings, while total audience is a supplemental metric. The Spanish-language
      broadcast on ESPN Deportes was seen by an average of 472,000 viewers; it ranked
      behind Super Bowl XLVIII as the second-most-watched Spanish-language cable telecast
      in U.S. history, outside of soccer games.


      CBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $5,000,000, a record
      high price for a Super Bowl ad. As of January 26, the advertisements had not
      yet sold out. CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering
      time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game, meaning that
      for the first time, digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising
      in pattern with the television broadcast. This would be the final year in a
      multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer
      to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount. It was also
      the final year that Doritos, a longtime sponsor of the game, held its "Crash
      the Super Bowl" contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads
      for a chance to have it aired during the game. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company
      also made their Super Bowl debut, Hyundai placed in both first and fifth place
      respectively on "USA Today"s Super Bowl Ad Meter survey, with their ads "First
      Date" (for the Hyundai Genesis) and "Ryanville" (for the 2017 Hyundai Elantra).


      First-time advertisers at Super Bowl 50 included Amazon.com, Colgate toothpaste,
      Death Wish Coffee (who beat 10 other small businesses in a contest held by Intuit,
      who paid for the ad time as a prize), LG Electronics, Marmot, Nintendo (promoting
      the 20th anniversary of the "Pokémon" franchise), PayPal, and SoFi.


      20th Century Fox, Lionsgate, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios and Walt
      Disney Studios paid for movie trailers to be aired during the Super Bowl. Fox
      paid for "Deadpool", "", "" and "Eddie the Eagle", Lionsgate paid for "Gods
      of Egypt", Paramount paid for "" and "10 Cloverfield Lane", Universal paid for
      "The Secret Life of Pets" and the debut trailer for "Jason Bourne" and Disney
      paid for "", "The Jungle Book" and "Alice Through the Looking Glass".


      Westwood One carried the game throughout North America, with Kevin Harlan as
      play-by-play announcer, Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts, and
      James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters. Jim Gray anchored the pre-game
      and halftime coverage.


      The flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team carried their
      local play-by-play calls. In Denver, KOA (850 AM) and KRFX (103.5 FM) carried
      the game, with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary.
      In North Carolina, WBT (1110 AM) carried the game, with Mick Mixon on play-by-play
      and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary. WBT also simulcast the
      game on its sister station WBT-FM (99.3 FM), based in Chester, South Carolina.
      As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations, the local broadcasts were audible
      over much of the western United States after sunset (for Denver) and the eastern
      United States throughout the game (for Carolina). In accordance with contractual
      rules, the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks either
      carried the Westwood One feed or did not air the game at all.


      In the United Kingdom, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra carried the
      contest. As in previous years, the BBC aired its own commercial-free British
      English broadcast, with Greg Brady, Darren Fletcher and Rocky Boiman on commentary.


      In honor of the 50th Super Bowl, the pregame ceremony featured the on-field
      introduction of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players. Bart
      Starr (MVP of Super Bowls I and II) and Chuck Howley (MVP of Super Bowl V) appeared
      via video. The late Harvey Martin, co-MVP of Super Bowl XII who died in 2001,
      was acknowledged when the other co-MVP of Super Bowl XII, Randy White, was introduced.
      Peyton Manning (MVP of Super Bowl XLI and the Broncos'' starting quarterback
      for the game) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game. This ceremony
      continued a ten-year tradition (starting with Super Bowl XX and then repeated
      in Super Bowl XXX and Super Bowl XL) in which past Super Bowl MVPs were honored
      before the game.


      Lady Gaga sang the national anthem, while Marlee Matlin simultaneously performed
      an American Sign Language (ASL) version of it. Matlin also signed an a cappella
      version of "America the Beautiful", which was sung by a U.S. Armed Forces chorus.


      In late November 2015, reports surfaced stating that "multiple acts" would perform
      during the halftime show. On December 3, the league confirmed that the show
      would be headlined by the British rock band Coldplay. On January 7, 2016, Pepsi
      confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé, who headlined the Super Bowl
      XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single "Hymn for the
      Weekend" (which was removed from the setlist before the game), would be making
      an appearance. Bruno Mars, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show,
      and Mark Ronson (Mars''s collaborator on "Uptown Funk") also performed.


      Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong. Peyton Manning completed
      an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre
      Caldwell. A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to
      the Panthers 14-yard line, but Carolina''s defense dug in over the next three
      plays. First, linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss.
      Then after an incompletion, Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain
      on third down, forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus
      34-yard field goal. The score marked the first time in the entire postseason
      that Carolina was facing a deficit.

      After each team punted, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete
      a 24-yard pass to Jerricho Cotchery, but the call was ruled an incompletion
      and upheld after a replay challenge. CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey
      stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass
      was complete. Two plays later, on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line, linebacker
      Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton''s hands while sacking him, and Malik
      Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown, giving the team
      a 10–0 lead. This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since
      Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season.


      After a punt from both teams, Carolina got on track with a 9-play, 73-yard scoring
      drive. Newton completed all four of his pass attempts for 51 yards and rushed
      twice for 25 yards, while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard
      touchdown run, cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter.
      Later on, Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman''s short 28-yard
      punt surrounded by Panthers players, but none of them attempted to make a tackle,
      apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch. Norwood had not done so,
      and with no resistance around him, he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard
      return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line. Despite
      Denver''s excellent field position, they could not get the ball into the end
      zone, so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7.


      On Carolina''s next possession, fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being
      tackled by safety Darian Stewart, which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered
      on the Broncos 40-yard line. However, the Panthers soon took the ball back when
      defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted
      it, returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left
      on the clock. The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and
      had to punt. After a Denver punt, Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line.
      But with 11 seconds left and no timeouts left, Newton was sacked by DeMarcus
      Ware causing time for the half to expire.


      The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half
      when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line
      on their second offensive play. But the Broncos defense halted the drive on
      the 26-yard line, and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights
      on a 44-yard field goal attempt. After the miss, Manning completed a pair of
      passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards, setting up McManus''
      33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead. Carolina got off to another
      strong start after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey
      Brown. But once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton
      pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J.
      Ward. Ward fumbled the ball deep in Denver territory during the return, but
      Trevathan was able to recover the ball enabling Denver to keep possession.

      There would be no more scoring in the third quarter, but early in the fourth,
      the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line. On the next play, Ealy knocked
      the ball out of Manning''s hand as he was winding up for a pass, and then recovered
      it for Carolina on the 50-yard line. A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and
      a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano''s 39-yard field goal, cutting the
      Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10. The next three drives of the game would
      end in punts.


      With 4:51 left in regulation, Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line
      with a chance to mount a game-winning drive, and soon faced 3rd-and-9. On the
      next play, Miller stripped the ball away from Newton, and after several players
      dove for it, it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward, who
      returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line. Newton was the third player
      to attempt a recovery (following Ware and Mike Remmers) of the ball and while
      various angles appeared to show that he had a decent probability of recovery
      if he''d dived in his attempt, Newton instead hesitated and then tried to drop
      on top of the ball, which failed. This split second decision later earned him
      criticism. Meanwhile, Denver''s offense was kept out of the end zone for three
      plays, but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new
      set of downs. Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed
      a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion, giving Denver a 24–10 lead
      with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away. Carolina had two more
      drives and managed one first down between them before the game ended.


      Manning finished the game 13 of 23 for 141 yards with one interception, two
      fumbles, and was sacked 5 times. Sanders was his top receiver with six receptions
      for 83 yards. Anderson was the game''s leading rusher with 90 yards and a touchdown,
      along with four receptions for 10 yards. Miller had six total tackles (five
      solo), 2½ sacks, and two forced fumbles. Ware had five total tackles and two
      sacks. Ward had seven total tackles, a fumble recovery, and an interception.
      McManus made all four of his field goals, making him perfect on all 11 attempts
      during the post-season.


      Newton completed 18 of 41 passes for 265 yards with one interception, two fumbles,
      and was sacked 6 times. He was also his team''s leading rusher with 45 yards
      on six carries. Brown caught four passes for 80 yards, while Ginn had four receptions
      for 74 yards. Ginn was sacked once on a trick play. Ealy was the top defensive
      performer for Carolina with four total tackles, three sacks, a forced fumble,
      a fumble recovery, and an interception. Defensive end Charles Johnson had four
      total tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble. Linebacker Luke Kuechly had 11 total
      tackles and a sack, while Thomas Davis had seven total tackles, despite playing
      just two weeks after breaking his right arm in the NFC title game.


      Super Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams. Denver won
      despite being massively outgained in total yards (315 to 194) and first downs
      (21 to 11). Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever
      by a Super Bowl winning team, as the previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore
      Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. Only seven other teams had ever gained fewer than
      200 yards in a Super Bowl, and all of them had lost. This was the first Super
      Bowl since Super Bowl XXXVI that the winning team scored only a single offensive
      touchdown, although the Broncos defense had earlier in the game scored a touchdown
      from a fumble recovery in the end zone. The Broncos'' seven sacks tied a Super
      Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. Manning was sacked five
      times by the Panthers, giving this game highest total (12) of combined sacks
      in Super Bowl history. Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks,
      and is the only such player to do so and record an interception. Jordan Norwood''s
      61-yard punt return set a new record, surpassing the old record of 45 yards
      set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII. Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down,
      while Carolina was 3-of-15. The two teams'' combined third down conversion percentage
      of 13.8 was the lowest in Super Bowl history. Manning and Newton had quarterback
      passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4, respectively, and their added total of 112
      is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl. Manning became
      the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39, the first quarterback
      ever to win a Super Bowl starting for two different teams, and the first quarterback
      ever to win 200 games (regular season and postseason) as a starter. Gary Kubiak
      became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went
      to the Super Bowl with as a player.


      Manning announced his retirement from the NFL a month after the Super Bowl.
      This was also the final game in the career of Panthers defensive lineman Jared
      Allen, who retired as the NFL''s ninth all-time leader in sacks.

      On September 8, 2016, the Broncos hosted the Panthers to open the 2016 NFL regular
      season. It was the first meeting of both Super Bowl participants during Week
      1 of the following season since the 1970 season when the Minnesota Vikings and
      Kansas City Chiefs held a rematch of Super Bowl IV to kick off the post-merger
      era of the NFL. The Broncos prevailed 21-20 as Carolina missed a field goal
      attempt to end the game.

      Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the
      National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season. The American Football Conference
      (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference (NFC)
      champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to win their third Super Bowl championship.
      The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi''s Stadium in Santa Clara,
      California (located in the San Francisco Bay Area). As this was the 50th Super
      Bowl, the league emphasized the "golden anniversary" with various gold-themed
      initiatives during the 2015 season, as well as suspending the tradition of naming
      each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been
      known as "Super Bowl L"), so the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals
      50.


      The Panthers finished the regular season with a 15–1 record, racking up the
      league''s top offense, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable
      Player (MVP). They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49–15 in the NFC Championship
      Game and advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance since the franchise
      was founded in 1995. The Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record,
      thanks to having the league''s top defense, and despite the struggles of starting
      quarterback Peyton Manning; they defeated the defending Super Bowl champion
      New England Patriots 20–18 in the AFC Championship Game. They joined the Patriots,
      Dallas Cowboys, and Pittsburgh Steelers as one of four teams that have made
      eight appearances in the Super Bowl.


      In one of the most defensive Super Bowl matchups in NFL history, the Broncos
      took an early lead in Super Bowl 50 and never trailed. Denver recorded seven
      sacks and forced three turnovers. Carolina likewise kept pace by recording five
      sacks and forcing two turnovers. Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super
      Bowl MVP. This game was also the final game of Peyton Manning''s career; he
      announced his retirement on March 7, 2016.


      CBS'' broadcast of the game was the third most-watched program in American television
      history with an average of 111.9 million viewers. The network charged an average
      of $5 million for a 30-second commercial during the game. The Super Bowl 50
      halftime show was headlined by Coldplay, with special guest performers Beyoncé
      and Bruno Mars.


      In early 2012, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the league planned
      to make the 50th Super Bowl "spectacular" and that it would be "an important
      game for us as a league".


      Cities included in early discussions or that submitted bids included:



      The league eventually narrowed the bids to three sites: New Orleans'' Mercedes-Benz
      Superdome, Miami''s Sun Life Stadium, and the San Francisco Bay Area''s Levi''s
      Stadium.


      The league announced on October 16, 2012, that the two finalists were Sun Life
      Stadium and Levi''s Stadium. The South Florida/Miami area has previously hosted
      the event 10 times (tied for most with New Orleans), with the most recent one
      being Super Bowl XLIV in 2010. The San Francisco Bay Area last hosted in 1985
      (Super Bowl XIX), held at Stanford Stadium in Stanford, California, won by the
      home team 49ers. The Miami bid depended on whether the stadium underwent renovations.
      However, on May 3, 2013, the Florida legislature refused to approve the funding
      plan to pay for the renovations, dealing a significant blow to Miami''s chances.


      On May 21, 2013, NFL owners at their spring meetings in Boston voted and awarded
      the game to Levi''s Stadium. The $1.2 billion stadium opened in 2014. It is
      the first Super Bowl held in the San Francisco Bay Area since Super Bowl XIX
      in 1985, and the first in California since Super Bowl XXXVII took place in San
      Diego in 2003.


      For the third straight season, the number one seeds in the NFC and AFC, the
      Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos, met in the Super Bowl. The game also featured
      the league''s top scoring offense (Panthers) against the league''s top defense
      (Broncos). The Panthers became the 10th team since 1960 to have lost just one
      game during the regular season, and the sixth team ever to have a 15–1 record.
      It was their second Super Bowl appearance; the other was Super Bowl XXXVIII.
      The Broncos became the fourth team to have eight Super Bowl appearances. It
      was their second appearance in three years, having also reached Super Bowl XLVIII.
      Coincidentally, John Fox was the head coach of each team in their previous Super
      Bowl appearance.


      Despite waiving long-time running back DeAngelo Williams and losing top wide
      receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn ACL in the preseason, the Carolina Panthers
      had their best regular season in franchise history, becoming the seventh team
      to win at least 15 regular season games since the league expanded to a 16-game
      schedule in . Carolina started the season 14–0, not only setting franchise records
      for the best start and the longest single-season winning streak, but also posting
      the best start to a season by an NFC team in NFL history, breaking the 13–0
      record previously shared with the 2009 New Orleans Saints and the 2011 Green
      Bay Packers. With their NFC-best 15–1 regular season record, the Panthers clinched
      home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs for the first time in franchise
      history. Ten players were selected to the Pro Bowl (the most in franchise history)
      along with eight All-Pro selections.


      The Panthers'' offense, which led the NFL in scoring (500 points), was loaded
      with talent, boasting six Pro Bowl selections. Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton
      had one of his best seasons, throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 yards,
      while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns (35 passing,
      10 rushing), a career-low 10 interceptions, and a career-best quarterback rating
      of 99.4. Newton''s leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen, who caught a
      career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns, and wide receiver
      Ted Ginn Jr., who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns; Ginn also
      rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards. Other key receivers
      included veteran Jerricho Cotchery (39 receptions for 485 yards), rookie Devin
      Funchess (31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns), and second-year
      receiver Corey Brown (31 receptions for 447 yards). The Panthers'' backfield
      featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart, who led the team with 989 rushing
      yards and six touchdowns in 13 games, along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert,
      who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards. Carolina''s
      offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections: center Ryan Kalil and
      guard Trai Turner.


      The Panthers'' defense gave up just 308 points, ranking sixth in the league,
      while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl
      selections. Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with
      11, while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two. Fellow lineman Mario
      Addison added 6½ sacks. The Panthers defensive line also featured veteran defensive
      end Jared Allen, a 5-time Pro Bowl selection, who was the NFL''s active career
      sack leader with 136, along with defensive end Kony Ealy, who had five sacks
      in just nine starts. Behind them, two of the Panthers'' three starting linebackers
      were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl: Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly. Davis
      compiled 5½ sacks, four forced fumbles, and four interceptions, while Kuechly
      led the team in tackles (118) forced two fumbles, and intercepted four passes
      of his own. Carolina''s secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman, who
      led the team with a career high seven interceptions, while also racking up 88
      tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman, who developed into a shutdown corner
      during the season and had four interceptions, two of which were returned for
      touchdowns.


      After losing in the divisional round of the playoffs during three of the previous
      four seasons, the Denver Broncos'' general manager John Elway made numerous
      coaching changes, including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox, who had
      won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach, being
      replaced in that role by Gary Kubiak, Elway''s former backup quarterback and
      former Broncos offensive coordinator. Wade Phillips, a former Broncos head coach,
      returned to the team to serve his second stint as defensive coordinator, succeeding
      Jack Del Rio who had left to take the head coaching vacancy at the Oakland Raiders.
      The team''s 43–8 loss in Super Bowl XLVIII two years earlier, despite holding
      the regular season''s top offense, resulted in Elway signing defensive end DeMarcus
      Ware, cornerback Aqib Talib, safety T. J. Ward, and wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders
      for the 2014 season.


      Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone
      blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning''s shotgun passing style,
      but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well
      as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the
      Indianapolis Colts in , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he
      had suffered since the summer. In addition, Manning was getting old, as he turned
      39 in the 2015 off-season. Though the team had a 7–0 start, Manning led the
      NFL in interceptions. In Week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar
      fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL''s all-time record for career passing
      yards in this game, but after throwing four interceptions, he was benched in
      favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for
      most of the remainder of the regular season. After a slow start in Denver''s
      final regular season game against San Diego, Osweiler was benched leading to
      Manning''s return. Manning re-claimed the starting quarterback position for
      the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to
      clinch the AFC''s No. 1 seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, who
      replaced his predecessor''s complicated read-and-react scheme with a simple
      aggressive approach of attacking the ball, the Broncos'' defense ranked No.
      1 in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous
      three seasons, the team continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise
      records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense,
      the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field
      advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.


      Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating, throwing for
      2,249 yards and nine touchdowns, with 17 interceptions. In contrast, Osweiler
      threw for 1,967 yards, 10 touchdowns and six interceptions for a rating of 86.4.
      Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105 receptions for 1,304
      yards and six touchdowns, while Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes for 1,135
      yards and six scores, while adding another 106 yards returning punts. Tight
      end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions
      for 517 yards. Running back C. J. Anderson was the team''s leading rusher 863
      yards and seven touchdowns, while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards. Running
      back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards, five touchdowns,
      24 receptions, and a 4.2 yards per carry average. Overall, the offense ranked
      19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections.


      The Broncos'' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed (4,530) for the
      first time in franchise history, and fourth in points allowed (296). Defensive
      ends Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson each had 5½ sacks. Pro Bowl linebacker Von
      Miller led the team with 11 sacks, forced four fumbles, and recovered three.
      Linebacker DeMarcus Ware was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the ninth
      time in his career, ranking second on the team with 7½ sacks. Linebacker Brandon
      Marshall led the team in total tackles with 109, while Danny Trevathan ranked
      second with 102 tackles. Cornerbacks Aqib Talib (three interceptions) and Chris
      Harris Jr. (two interceptions) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the
      defense, though none of the players selected for the Pro Bowl participated due
      to the Broncos reaching Super Bowl 50.


      The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round, running up a
      31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious second half comeback attempt
      to win 31–24, avenging their elimination from a year earlier. The Panthers then
      blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game, 49–15, racking
      up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers.


      The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round, 23–16,
      by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game. They then defeated
      the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship
      Game, 20–18, by intercepting a pass on New England''s 2-point conversion attempt
      with 17 seconds left on the clock and recovering a subsequent onside kick attempt.


      Carolina suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis, an 11-year veteran who
      had already overcome three ACL tears in his career, went down with a broken
      arm in the NFC Championship Game. Despite this, he insisted he would still find
      a way to play in the Super Bowl. His prediction turned out to be accurate and
      he made it into the starting lineup.


      Peyton Manning reached his fourth Super Bowl, with appearances under as many
      head coaches (Tony Dungy, Jim Caldwell, John Fox and Gary Kubiak). He became
      the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls.
      He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39. The
      past record was held by John Elway, who led the Broncos to victory in Super
      Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver''s Executive Vice President of
      Football Operations and General Manager.


      Manning and Newton set the record for the largest age difference between opposing
      Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days (Manning was 39, Newton was
      26). In addition, this was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on
      both teams who was the #1 pick in their draft classes. Manning was the #1 selection
      of the 1998 NFL Draft, while Newton was picked first in 2011. The matchup also
      pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other: Newton for Carolina
      and Von Miller for Denver.


      With Ron Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl
      XX, and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos'' defeats in Super
      Bowls XXI and XXIV, this was the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches
      played in the game themselves; coincidentally, the coaches they had played under,
      Mike Ditka (Rivera) and Dan Reeves (Kubiak), not only had Super Bowl playing
      experience themselves, but had done so as teammates with the Dallas Cowboys
      in Super Bowls V and VI (and worked together as Cowboys assistant coaches for
      Super Bowls X, XII and XIII).


      Concerns were raised over whether Levi''s Stadium''s field was of a high enough
      quality to host a Super Bowl; during the inaugural season, the field had to
      be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues, and earlier in the 2015 season,
      a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker,
      causing him to slip and miss a field goal, although the field has not had any
      major issues since. As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass
      stadiums, the NFL re-sodded the hybrid Bermuda 419 turf playing surface prior
      to the game; NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the
      field was in "great shape" for the game. However, the turf showed problems throughout
      the game, with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the
      game and players slipping during plays all throughout the game.


      As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams,
      the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants.
      Elway stated, "We''ve had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms." The Broncos
      last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII,
      Elway''s last game as Denver QB, when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19.
      In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII, Denver wore blue jerseys,
      which was their primary color at the time. They also lost Super Bowl XXI when
      they wore white jerseys, but they are 0–4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange
      jerseys, losing in Super Bowl XII, XXII, XXIV, and XLVIII. The only other AFC
      champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl
      was the Pittsburgh Steelers; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super
      Bowl XL 10 seasons prior. The Broncos'' decision to wear white meant the Panthers
      would wear their standard home uniform: black jerseys with silver pants.


      The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San
      Jose Marriott. The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the
      Santa Clara Marriott.


      On June 4, 2014, the NFL announced that the game would be branded with Arabic
      numerals as "Super Bowl 50"—rather than with Roman numerals, a practice established
      at Super Bowl V under which the game would have been known as "Super Bowl L".
      NFL creative director Shandon Melvin, explained that a primary reason for the
      change was the difficulty in designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the
      letter "L" using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV.
      He noted that "L" was harder to design around as it is asymmetrical unlike other
      Roman numerals, and also showed concerns that use of the letter "L" could be
      interpreted as the "loser" hand gesture. 73 different mockups, incorporating
      either "L" or "50", were designed before the final design was chosen, which
      featured large numerals colored in gold behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead
      of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo.


      Tying into the game''s "golden anniversary," various gold-themed promotions
      and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season. The league adopted
      a gold-tinted logo, which was implemented across all of the NFL''s properties
      and painted on fields during the season. The numbering of the 50-yard line on
      fields was colored gold, and beginning on week 7, all sideline jackets and hats
      featured gold-trimmed logos. Gold footballs were given to each high school that
      has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl, and "homecoming" events
      were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games.


      Ten themed "50" statues were placed in locations across San Francisco to promote
      the game; however, due to the negativity towards the game by residents of the
      city, the statues notably became the target of vandals, with the "SUPER BOWL
      50" lettering on their bases re-arranged to form other phrases such as "SUPERB
      OWL", "SUP BRO 50", and after the Alamo Square statue was toppled, "OOPS".


      The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. In
      addition, "Super Bowl City" opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The
      Embarcadero, featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area''s
      technology, culinary creations, and cultural diversity. More than a million
      people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super
      Bowl Week. San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence
      in this area "they are going to have to leave". San Francisco city supervisor
      Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city
      services in the amount of $5 million.


      In addition, there are $2 million worth of other ancillary events, including
      a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center, a beer, wine and food
      festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University, and a pep rally. A professional
      fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual donors, but
      still may need the city council to help fund the event. Additional funding will
      be provided by the city council, which has announced plans to set aside seed
      funding for the event.


      The game''s media day, which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior
      to the game, was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as "Super Bowl Opening
      Night". The event was held on February 1, 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose. Alongside
      the traditional media availabilities, the event featured an opening ceremony
      with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge.


      For the first time, the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL have openly
      sought disabled veteran and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-owned businesses
      in Business Connect, the Super Bowl program that provides local companies with
      contracting opportunities in and around the Super Bowl. The host committee has
      already raised over $40 million through sponsors including Apple, Google, Yahoo!,
      Intel, Gap, Chevron, and Dignity Health.


      The Super Bowl 50 Host Committee has vowed to be "the most giving Super Bowl
      ever", and will dedicate 25 percent of all money it raises for philanthropic
      causes in the Bay Area. The committee created the 50 fund as its philanthropic
      initiative and focuses on providing grants to aid with youth development, community
      investment and sustainable environments.


      In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that all Super Bowl champions receive,
      the winning team also received a large, 18-karat gold-plated "50". Each digit
      weighs for a total of . Like the Lombardi Trophy, the "50" was designed by Tiffany
      & Co.


      After putting out a call for volunteers in June 2015, over 450 volunteers helped
      to make the Super Bowl 50 Tour happen. More than 5,000 volunteers were on hand
      to help with events leading up to, during and after Super Bowl 50 as well. Volunteers
      signed up for a minimum of 3–4 hour shifts, and some volunteers gave more than
      200 hours of their time over the course of the week. As a thank you for volunteering,
      volunteers were gifted backpacks and uniforms.


      In the United States, the game was televised by CBS, as part of a cycle between
      the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL. The network''s lead
      broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest, with Tracy Wolfson
      and Evan Washburn on the sidelines. CBS introduced new features during the telecast,
      including pylon cameras and microphones along with "EyeVision 360"—an array
      of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree
      view of plays and "bullet time" effects. (An earlier version of "EyeVision"
      was last used in Super Bowl XXXV; for Super Bowl 50, the cameras were upgraded
      to 5K resolution.) CBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com,
      and the CBS Sports apps on tablets, Windows 10, Xbox One and other digital media
      players (such as Chromecast and Roku). Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity,
      streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via
      the NFL Mobile service.


      On December 28, 2015, ESPN announced that they had reached an agreement with
      CBS and the NFL to provide a dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of Super Bowl
      50, airing on ESPN Deportes and streaming on WatchESPN, featuring commentary
      and surrounding coverage in the language; unlike Fox and NBC, CBS does not have
      a Spanish-language cable network that could have carried such a broadcast. The
      production utilized CBS''s video, but with Spanish-language graphics provided
      by ESPN, and its "Monday Night Football" commentary crew of Alvaro Martin, Raul
      Allegre, and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe. ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game
      and post-game coverage, while Martin, Allegre, and Sutcliffe also contributed
      reports for the English-language ESPN as part of efforts to promote the simulcast.
      ESPN Deportes'' vice president of programming Freddy Rolon felt that dedicated
      Spanish-language coverage appealed better to Hispanic viewers than Spanish commentary
      on the SAP audio channel, going on to say that "I have family members who watch
      Spanish language television and they don''t know where that SAP button is to
      begin with".


      As opposed to broadcasts of primetime series, CBS broadcast special episodes
      of its late-night talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50, beginning
      with a special episode of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" following the
      game. Following a break for late local programming, CBS also aired a special
      episode of "The Late Late Show with James Corden".


      With an average TV audience of 111.9 million, the game was the third most-watched
      Super Bowl—and third most-watched U.S. program—in history, according to the
      Nielsen ratings. It was also the most-watched program of all-time in terms of
      total audience, 167-million, which measures those who viewed at least six minutes
      of the broadcast. Average viewership is the industry standard for determining
      television ratings, while total audience is a supplemental metric. The Spanish-language
      broadcast on ESPN Deportes was seen by an average of 472,000 viewers; it ranked
      behind Super Bowl XLVIII as the second-most-watched Spanish-language cable telecast
      in U.S. history, outside of soccer games.


      CBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $5,000,000, a record
      high price for a Super Bowl ad. As of January 26, the advertisements had not
      yet sold out. CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering
      time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game, meaning that
      for the first time, digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising
      in pattern with the television broadcast. This would be the final year in a
      multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer
      to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount. It was also
      the final year that Doritos, a longtime sponsor of the game, held its "Crash
      the Super Bowl" contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads
      for a chance to have it aired during the game. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company
      also made their Super Bowl debut, Hyundai placed in both first and fifth place
      respectively on "USA Today"s Super Bowl Ad Meter survey, with their ads "First
      Date" (for the Hyundai Genesis) and "Ryanville" (for the 2017 Hyundai Elantra).


      First-time advertisers at Super Bowl 50 included Amazon.com, Colgate toothpaste,
      Death Wish Coffee (who beat 10 other small businesses in a contest held by Intuit,
      who paid for the ad time as a prize), LG Electronics, Marmot, Nintendo (promoting
      the 20th anniversary of the "Pokémon" franchise), PayPal, and SoFi.


      20th Century Fox, Lionsgate, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios and Walt
      Disney Studios paid for movie trailers to be aired during the Super Bowl. Fox
      paid for "Deadpool", "", "" and "Eddie the Eagle", Lionsgate paid for "Gods
      of Egypt", Paramount paid for "" and "10 Cloverfield Lane", Universal paid for
      "The Secret Life of Pets" and the debut trailer for "Jason Bourne" and Disney
      paid for "", "The Jungle Book" and "Alice Through the Looking Glass".


      Westwood One carried the game throughout North America, with Kevin Harlan as
      play-by-play announcer, Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts, and
      James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters. Jim Gray anchored the pre-game
      and halftime coverage.


      The flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team carried their
      local play-by-play calls. In Denver, KOA (850 AM) and KRFX (103.5 FM) carried
      the game, with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary.
      In North Carolina, WBT (1110 AM) carried the game, with Mick Mixon on play-by-play
      and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary. WBT also simulcast the
      game on its sister station WBT-FM (99.3 FM), based in Chester, South Carolina.
      As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations, the local broadcasts were audible
      over much of the western United States after sunset (for Denver) and the eastern
      United States throughout the game (for Carolina). In accordance with contractual
      rules, the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks either
      carried the Westwood One feed or did not air the game at all.


      In the United Kingdom, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra carried the
      contest. As in previous years, the BBC aired its own commercial-free British
      English broadcast, with Greg Brady, Darren Fletcher and Rocky Boiman on commentary.


      In honor of the 50th Super Bowl, the pregame ceremony featured the on-field
      introduction of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players. Bart
      Starr (MVP of Super Bowls I and II) and Chuck Howley (MVP of Super Bowl V) appeared
      via video. The late Harvey Martin, co-MVP of Super Bowl XII who died in 2001,
      was acknowledged when the other co-MVP of Super Bowl XII, Randy White, was introduced.
      Peyton Manning (MVP of Super Bowl XLI and the Broncos'' starting quarterback
      for the game) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game. This ceremony
      continued a ten-year tradition (starting with Super Bowl XX and then repeated
      in Super Bowl XXX and Super Bowl XL) in which past Super Bowl MVPs were honored
      before the game.


      Lady Gaga sang the national anthem, while Marlee Matlin simultaneously performed
      an American Sign Language (ASL) version of it. Matlin also signed an a cappella
      version of "America the Beautiful", which was sung by a U.S. Armed Forces chorus.


      In late November 2015, reports surfaced stating that "multiple acts" would perform
      during the halftime show. On December 3, the league confirmed that the show
      would be headlined by the British rock band Coldplay. On January 7, 2016, Pepsi
      confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé, who headlined the Super Bowl
      XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single "Hymn for the
      Weekend" (which was removed from the setlist before the game), would be making
      an appearance. Bruno Mars, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show,
      and Mark Ronson (Mars''s collaborator on "Uptown Funk") also performed.


      Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong. Peyton Manning completed
      an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre
      Caldwell. A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to
      the Panthers 14-yard line, but Carolina''s defense dug in over the next three
      plays. First, linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss.
      Then after an incompletion, Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain
      on third down, forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus
      34-yard field goal. The score marked the first time in the entire postseason
      that Carolina was facing a deficit.

      After each team punted, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete
      a 24-yard pass to Jerricho Cotchery, but the call was ruled an incompletion
      and upheld after a replay challenge. CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey
      stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass
      was complete. Two plays later, on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line, linebacker
      Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton''s hands while sacking him, and Malik
      Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown, giving the team
      a 10–0 lead. This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since
      Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season.


      After a punt from both teams, Carolina got on track with a 9-play, 73-yard scoring
      drive. Newton completed all four of his pass attempts for 51 yards and rushed
      twice for 25 yards, while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard
      touchdown run, cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter.
      Later on, Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman''s short 28-yard
      punt surrounded by Panthers players, but none of them attempted to make a tackle,
      apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch. Norwood had not done so,
      and with no resistance around him, he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard
      return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line. Despite
      Denver''s excellent field position, they could not get the ball into the end
      zone, so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7.


      On Carolina''s next possession, fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being
      tackled by safety Darian Stewart, which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered
      on the Broncos 40-yard line. However, the Panthers soon took the ball back when
      defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted
      it, returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left
      on the clock. The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and
      had to punt. After a Denver punt, Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line.
      But with 11 seconds left and no timeouts left, Newton was sacked by DeMarcus
      Ware causing time for the half to expire.


      The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half
      when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line
      on their second offensive play. But the Broncos defense halted the drive on
      the 26-yard line, and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights
      on a 44-yard field goal attempt. After the miss, Manning completed a pair of
      passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards, setting up McManus''
      33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead. Carolina got off to another
      strong start after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey
      Brown. But once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton
      pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J.
      Ward. Ward fumbled the ball deep in Denver territory during the return, but
      Trevathan was able to recover the ball enabling Denver to keep possession.

      There would be no more scoring in the third quarter, but early in the fourth,
      the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line. On the next play, Ealy knocked
      the ball out of Manning''s hand as he was winding up for a pass, and then recovered
      it for Carolina on the 50-yard line. A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and
      a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano''s 39-yard field goal, cutting the
      Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10. The next three drives of the game would
      end in punts.


      With 4:51 left in regulation, Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line
      with a chance to mount a game-winning drive, and soon faced 3rd-and-9. On the
      next play, Miller stripped the ball away from Newton, and after several players
      dove for it, it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward, who
      returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line. Newton was the third player
      to attempt a recovery (following Ware and Mike Remmers) of the ball and while
      various angles appeared to show that he had a decent probability of recovery
      if he''d dived in his attempt, Newton instead hesitated and then tried to drop
      on top of the ball, which failed. This split second decision later earned him
      criticism. Meanwhile, Denver''s offense was kept out of the end zone for three
      plays, but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new
      set of downs. Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed
      a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion, giving Denver a 24–10 lead
      with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away. Carolina had two more
      drives and managed one first down between them before the game ended.


      Manning finished the game 13 of 23 for 141 yards with one interception, two
      fumbles, and was sacked 5 times. Sanders was his top receiver with six receptions
      for 83 yards. Anderson was the game''s leading rusher with 90 yards and a touchdown,
      along with four receptions for 10 yards. Miller had six total tackles (five
      solo), 2½ sacks, and two forced fumbles. Ware had five total tackles and two
      sacks. Ward had seven total tackles, a fumble recovery, and an interception.
      McManus made all four of his field goals, making him perfect on all 11 attempts
      during the post-season.


      Newton completed 18 of 41 passes for 265 yards with one interception, two fumbles,
      and was sacked 6 times. He was also his team''s leading rusher with 45 yards
      on six carries. Brown caught four passes for 80 yards, while Ginn had four receptions
      for 74 yards. Ginn was sacked once on a trick play. Ealy was the top defensive
      performer for Carolina with four total tackles, three sacks, a forced fumble,
      a fumble recovery, and an interception. Defensive end Charles Johnson had four
      total tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble. Linebacker Luke Kuechly had 11 total
      tackles and a sack, while Thomas Davis had seven total tackles, despite playing
      just two weeks after breaking his right arm in the NFC title game.


      Super Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams. Denver won
      despite being massively outgained in total yards (315 to 194) and first downs
      (21 to 11). Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever
      by a Super Bowl winning team, as the previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore
      Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. Only seven other teams had ever gained fewer than
      200 yards in a Super Bowl, and all of them had lost. This was the first Super
      Bowl since Super Bowl XXXVI that the winning team scored only a single offensive
      touchdown, although the Broncos defense had earlier in the game scored a touchdown
      from a fumble recovery in the end zone. The Broncos'' seven sacks tied a Super
      Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. Manning was sacked five
      times by the Panthers, giving this game highest total (12) of combined sacks
      in Super Bowl history. Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks,
      and is the only such player to do so and record an interception. Jordan Norwood''s
      61-yard punt return set a new record, surpassing the old record of 45 yards
      set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII. Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down,
      while Carolina was 3-of-15. The two teams'' combined third down conversion percentage
      of 13.8 was the lowest in Super Bowl history. Manning and Newton had quarterback
      passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4, respectively, and their added total of 112
      is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl. Manning became
      the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39, the first quarterback
      ever to win a Super Bowl starting for two different teams, and the first quarterback
      ever to win 200 games (regular season and postseason) as a starter. Gary Kubiak
      became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went
      to the Super Bowl with as a player.


      Manning announced his retirement from the NFL a month after the Super Bowl.
      This was also the final game in the career of Panthers defensive lineman Jared
      Allen, who retired as the NFL''s ninth all-time leader in sacks.

      On September 8, 2016, the Broncos hosted the Panthers to open the 2016 NFL regular
      season. It was the first meeting of both Super Bowl participants during Week
      1 of the following season since the 1970 season when the Minnesota Vikings and
      Kansas City Chiefs held a rematch of Super Bowl IV to kick off the post-merger
      era of the NFL. The Broncos prevailed 21-20 as Carolina missed a field goal
      attempt to end the game.

      Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the
      National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season. The American Football Conference
      (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference (NFC)
      champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to win their third Super Bowl championship.
      The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi''s Stadium in Santa Clara,
      California (located in the San Francisco Bay Area). As this was the 50th Super
      Bowl, the league emphasized the "golden anniversary" with various gold-themed
      initiatives during the 2015 season, as well as suspending the tradition of naming
      each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been
      known as "Super Bowl L"), so the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals
      50.


      The Panthers finished the regular season with a 15–1 record, racking up the
      league''s top offense, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable
      Player (MVP). They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49–15 in the NFC Championship
      Game and advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance since the franchise
      was founded in 1995. The Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record,
      thanks to having the league''s top defense, and despite the struggles of starting
      quarterback Peyton Manning; they defeated the defending Super Bowl champion
      New England Patriots 20–18 in the AFC Championship Game. They joined the Patriots,
      Dallas Cowboys, and Pittsburgh Steelers as one of four teams that have made
      eight appearances in the Super Bowl.


      In one of the most defensive Super Bowl matchups in NFL history, the Broncos
      took an early lead in Super Bowl 50 and never trailed. Denver recorded seven
      sacks and forced three turnovers. Carolina likewise kept pace by recording five
      sacks and forcing two turnovers. Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super
      Bowl MVP. This game was also the final game of Peyton Manning''s career; he
      announced his retirement on March 7, 2016.


      CBS'' broadcast of the game was the third most-watched program in American television
      history with an average of 111.9 million viewers. The network charged an average
      of $5 million for a 30-second commercial during the game. The Super Bowl 50
      halftime show was headlined by Coldplay, with special guest performers Beyoncé
      and Bruno Mars.


      In early 2012, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the league planned
      to make the 50th Super Bowl "spectacular" and that it would be "an important
      game for us as a league".


      Cities included in early discussions or that submitted bids included:



      The league eventually narrowed the bids to three sites: New Orleans'' Mercedes-Benz
      Superdome, Miami''s Sun Life Stadium, and the San Francisco Bay Area''s Levi''s
      Stadium.


      The league announced on October 16, 2012, that the two finalists were Sun Life
      Stadium and Levi''s Stadium. The South Florida/Miami area has previously hosted
      the event 10 times (tied for most with New Orleans), with the most recent one
      being Super Bowl XLIV in 2010. The San Francisco Bay Area last hosted in 1985
      (Super Bowl XIX), held at Stanford Stadium in Stanford, California, won by the
      home team 49ers. The Miami bid depended on whether the stadium underwent renovations.
      However, on May 3, 2013, the Florida legislature refused to approve the funding
      plan to pay for the renovations, dealing a significant blow to Miami''s chances.


      On May 21, 2013, NFL owners at their spring meetings in Boston voted and awarded
      the game to Levi''s Stadium. The $1.2 billion stadium opened in 2014. It is
      the first Super Bowl held in the San Francisco Bay Area since Super Bowl XIX
      in 1985, and the first in California since Super Bowl XXXVII took place in San
      Diego in 2003.


      For the third straight season, the number one seeds in the NFC and AFC, the
      Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos, met in the Super Bowl. The game also featured
      the league''s top scoring offense (Panthers) against the league''s top defense
      (Broncos). The Panthers became the 10th team since 1960 to have lost just one
      game during the regular season, and the sixth team ever to have a 15–1 record.
      It was their second Super Bowl appearance; the other was Super Bowl XXXVIII.
      The Broncos became the fourth team to have eight Super Bowl appearances. It
      was their second appearance in three years, having also reached Super Bowl XLVIII.
      Coincidentally, John Fox was the head coach of each team in their previous Super
      Bowl appearance.


      Despite waiving long-time running back DeAngelo Williams and losing top wide
      receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn ACL in the preseason, the Carolina Panthers
      had their best regular season in franchise history, becoming the seventh team
      to win at least 15 regular season games since the league expanded to a 16-game
      schedule in . Carolina started the season 14–0, not only setting franchise records
      for the best start and the longest single-season winning streak, but also posting
      the best start to a season by an NFC team in NFL history, breaking the 13–0
      record previously shared with the 2009 New Orleans Saints and the 2011 Green
      Bay Packers. With their NFC-best 15–1 regular season record, the Panthers clinched
      home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs for the first time in franchise
      history. Ten players were selected to the Pro Bowl (the most in franchise history)
      along with eight All-Pro selections.


      The Panthers'' offense, which led the NFL in scoring (500 points), was loaded
      with talent, boasting six Pro Bowl selections. Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton
      had one of his best seasons, throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 yards,
      while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns (35 passing,
      10 rushing), a career-low 10 interceptions, and a career-best quarterback rating
      of 99.4. Newton''s leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen, who caught a
      career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns, and wide receiver
      Ted Ginn Jr., who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns; Ginn also
      rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards. Other key receivers
      included veteran Jerricho Cotchery (39 receptions for 485 yards), rookie Devin
      Funchess (31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns), and second-year
      receiver Corey Brown (31 receptions for 447 yards). The Panthers'' backfield
      featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart, who led the team with 989 rushing
      yards and six touchdowns in 13 games, along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert,
      who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards. Carolina''s
      offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections: center Ryan Kalil and
      guard Trai Turner.


      The Panthers'' defense gave up just 308 points, ranking sixth in the league,
      while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl
      selections. Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with
      11, while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two. Fellow lineman Mario
      Addison added 6½ sacks. The Panthers defensive line also featured veteran defensive
      end Jared Allen, a 5-time Pro Bowl selection, who was the NFL''s active career
      sack leader with 136, along with defensive end Kony Ealy, who had five sacks
      in just nine starts. Behind them, two of the Panthers'' three starting linebackers
      were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl: Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly. Davis
      compiled 5½ sacks, four forced fumbles, and four interceptions, while Kuechly
      led the team in tackles (118) forced two fumbles, and intercepted four passes
      of his own. Carolina''s secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman, who
      led the team with a career high seven interceptions, while also racking up 88
      tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman, who developed into a shutdown corner
      during the season and had four interceptions, two of which were returned for
      touchdowns.


      After losing in the divisional round of the playoffs during three of the previous
      four seasons, the Denver Broncos'' general manager John Elway made numerous
      coaching changes, including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox, who had
      won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach, being
      replaced in that role by Gary Kubiak, Elway''s former backup quarterback and
      former Broncos offensive coordinator. Wade Phillips, a former Broncos head coach,
      returned to the team to serve his second stint as defensive coordinator, succeeding
      Jack Del Rio who had left to take the head coaching vacancy at the Oakland Raiders.
      The team''s 43–8 loss in Super Bowl XLVIII two years earlier, despite holding
      the regular season''s top offense, resulted in Elway signing defensive end DeMarcus
      Ware, cornerback Aqib Talib, safety T. J. Ward, and wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders
      for the 2014 season.


      Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone
      blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning''s shotgun passing style,
      but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well
      as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the
      Indianapolis Colts in , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he
      had suffered since the summer. In addition, Manning was getting old, as he turned
      39 in the 2015 off-season. Though the team had a 7–0 start, Manning led the
      NFL in interceptions. In Week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar
      fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL''s all-time record for career passing
      yards in this game, but after throwing four interceptions, he was benched in
      favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for
      most of the remainder of the regular season. After a slow start in Denver''s
      final regular season game against San Diego, Osweiler was benched leading to
      Manning''s return. Manning re-claimed the starting quarterback position for
      the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to
      clinch the AFC''s No. 1 seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, who
      replaced his predecessor''s complicated read-and-react scheme with a simple
      aggressive approach of attacking the ball, the Broncos'' defense ranked No.
      1 in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous
      three seasons, the team continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise
      records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense,
      the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field
      advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.


      Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating, throwing for
      2,249 yards and nine touchdowns, with 17 interceptions. In contrast, Osweiler
      threw for 1,967 yards, 10 touchdowns and six interceptions for a rating of 86.4.
      Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105 receptions for 1,304
      yards and six touchdowns, while Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes for 1,135
      yards and six scores, while adding another 106 yards returning punts. Tight
      end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions
      for 517 yards. Running back C. J. Anderson was the team''s leading rusher 863
      yards and seven touchdowns, while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards. Running
      back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards, five touchdowns,
      24 receptions, and a 4.2 yards per carry average. Overall, the offense ranked
      19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections.


      The Broncos'' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed (4,530) for the
      first time in franchise history, and fourth in points allowed (296). Defensive
      ends Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson each had 5½ sacks. Pro Bowl linebacker Von
      Miller led the team with 11 sacks, forced four fumbles, and recovered three.
      Linebacker DeMarcus Ware was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the ninth
      time in his career, ranking second on the team with 7½ sacks. Linebacker Brandon
      Marshall led the team in total tackles with 109, while Danny Trevathan ranked
      second with 102 tackles. Cornerbacks Aqib Talib (three interceptions) and Chris
      Harris Jr. (two interceptions) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the
      defense, though none of the players selected for the Pro Bowl participated due
      to the Broncos reaching Super Bowl 50.


      The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round, running up a
      31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious second half comeback attempt
      to win 31–24, avenging their elimination from a year earlier. The Panthers then
      blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game, 49–15, racking
      up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers.


      The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round, 23–16,
      by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game. They then defeated
      the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship
      Game, 20–18, by intercepting a pass on New England''s 2-point conversion attempt
      with 17 seconds left on the clock and recovering a subsequent onside kick attempt.


      Carolina suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis, an 11-year veteran who
      had already overcome three ACL tears in his career, went down with a broken
      arm in the NFC Championship Game. Despite this, he insisted he would still find
      a way to play in the Super Bowl. His prediction turned out to be accurate and
      he made it into the starting lineup.


      Peyton Manning reached his fourth Super Bowl, with appearances under as many
      head coaches (Tony Dungy, Jim Caldwell, John Fox and Gary Kubiak). He became
      the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls.
      He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39. The
      past record was held by John Elway, who led the Broncos to victory in Super
      Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver''s Executive Vice President of
      Football Operations and General Manager.


      Manning and Newton set the record for the largest age difference between opposing
      Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days (Manning was 39, Newton was
      26). In addition, this was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on
      both teams who was the #1 pick in their draft classes. Manning was the #1 selection
      of the 1998 NFL Draft, while Newton was picked first in 2011. The matchup also
      pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other: Newton for Carolina
      and Von Miller for Denver.


      With Ron Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl
      XX, and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos'' defeats in Super
      Bowls XXI and XXIV, this was the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches
      played in the game themselves; coincidentally, the coaches they had played under,
      Mike Ditka (Rivera) and Dan Reeves (Kubiak), not only had Super Bowl playing
      experience themselves, but had done so as teammates with the Dallas Cowboys
      in Super Bowls V and VI (and worked together as Cowboys assistant coaches for
      Super Bowls X, XII and XIII).


      Concerns were raised over whether Levi''s Stadium''s field was of a high enough
      quality to host a Super Bowl; during the inaugural season, the field had to
      be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues, and earlier in the 2015 season,
      a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker,
      causing him to slip and miss a field goal, although the field has not had any
      major issues since. As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass
      stadiums, the NFL re-sodded the hybrid Bermuda 419 turf playing surface prior
      to the game; NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the
      field was in "great shape" for the game. However, the turf showed problems throughout
      the game, with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the
      game and players slipping during plays all throughout the game.


      As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams,
      the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants.
      Elway stated, "We''ve had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms." The Broncos
      last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII,
      Elway''s last game as Denver QB, when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19.
      In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII, Denver wore blue jerseys,
      which was their primary color at the time. They also lost Super Bowl XXI when
      they wore white jerseys, but they are 0–4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange
      jerseys, losing in Super Bowl XII, XXII, XXIV, and XLVIII. The only other AFC
      champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl
      was the Pittsburgh Steelers; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super
      Bowl XL 10 seasons prior. The Broncos'' decision to wear white meant the Panthers
      would wear their standard home uniform: black jerseys with silver pants.


      The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San
      Jose Marriott. The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the
      Santa Clara Marriott.


      On June 4, 2014, the NFL announced that the game would be branded with Arabic
      numerals as "Super Bowl 50"—rather than with Roman numerals, a practice established
      at Super Bowl V under which the game would have been known as "Super Bowl L".
      NFL creative director Shandon Melvin, explained that a primary reason for the
      change was the difficulty in designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the
      letter "L" using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV.
      He noted that "L" was harder to design around as it is asymmetrical unlike other
      Roman numerals, and also showed concerns that use of the letter "L" could be
      interpreted as the "loser" hand gesture. 73 different mockups, incorporating
      either "L" or "50", were designed before the final design was chosen, which
      featured large numerals colored in gold behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead
      of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo.


      Tying into the game''s "golden anniversary," various gold-themed promotions
      and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season. The league adopted
      a gold-tinted logo, which was implemented across all of the NFL''s properties
      and painted on fields during the season. The numbering of the 50-yard line on
      fields was colored gold, and beginning on week 7, all sideline jackets and hats
      featured gold-trimmed logos. Gold footballs were given to each high school that
      has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl, and "homecoming" events
      were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games.


      Ten themed "50" statues were placed in locations across San Francisco to promote
      the game; however, due to the negativity towards the game by residents of the
      city, the statues notably became the target of vandals, with the "SUPER BOWL
      50" lettering on their bases re-arranged to form other phrases such as "SUPERB
      OWL", "SUP BRO 50", and after the Alamo Square statue was toppled, "OOPS".


      The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. In
      addition, "Super Bowl City" opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The
      Embarcadero, featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area''s
      technology, culinary creations, and cultural diversity. More than a million
      people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super
      Bowl Week. San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence
      in this area "they are going to have to leave". San Francisco city supervisor
      Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city
      services in the amount of $5 million.


      In addition, there are $2 million worth of other ancillary events, including
      a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center, a beer, wine and food
      festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University, and a pep rally. A professional
      fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual donors, but
      still may need the city council to help fund the event. Additional funding will
      be provided by the city council, which has announced plans to set aside seed
      funding for the event.


      The game''s media day, which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior
      to the game, was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as "Super Bowl Opening
      Night". The event was held on February 1, 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose. Alongside
      the traditional media availabilities, the event featured an opening ceremony
      with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge.


      For the first time, the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL have openly
      sought disabled veteran and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-owned businesses
      in Business Connect, the Super Bowl program that provides local companies with
      contracting opportunities in and around the Super Bowl. The host committee has
      already raised over $40 million through sponsors including Apple, Google, Yahoo!,
      Intel, Gap, Chevron, and Dignity Health.


      The Super Bowl 50 Host Committee has vowed to be "the most giving Super Bowl
      ever", and will dedicate 25 percent of all money it raises for philanthropic
      causes in the Bay Area. The committee created the 50 fund as its philanthropic
      initiative and focuses on providing grants to aid with youth development, community
      investment and sustainable environments.


      In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that all Super Bowl champions receive,
      the winning team also received a large, 18-karat gold-plated "50". Each digit
      weighs for a total of . Like the Lombardi Trophy, the "50" was designed by Tiffany
      & Co.


      After putting out a call for volunteers in June 2015, over 450 volunteers helped
      to make the Super Bowl 50 Tour happen. More than 5,000 volunteers were on hand
      to help with events leading up to, during and after Super Bowl 50 as well. Volunteers
      signed up for a minimum of 3–4 hour shifts, and some volunteers gave more than
      200 hours of their time over the course of the week. As a thank you for volunteering,
      volunteers were gifted backpacks and uniforms.


      In the United States, the game was televised by CBS, as part of a cycle between
      the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL. The network''s lead
      broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest, with Tracy Wolfson
      and Evan Washburn on the sidelines. CBS introduced new features during the telecast,
      including pylon cameras and microphones along with "EyeVision 360"—an array
      of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree
      view of plays and "bullet time" effects. (An earlier version of "EyeVision"
      was last used in Super Bowl XXXV; for Super Bowl 50, the cameras were upgraded
      to 5K resolution.) CBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com,
      and the CBS Sports apps on tablets, Windows 10, Xbox One and other digital media
      players (such as Chromecast and Roku). Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity,
      streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via
      the NFL Mobile service.


      On December 28, 2015, ESPN announced that they had reached an agreement with
      CBS and the NFL to provide a dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of Super Bowl
      50, airing on ESPN Deportes and streaming on WatchESPN, featuring commentary
      and surrounding coverage in the language; unlike Fox and NBC, CBS does not have
      a Spanish-language cable network that could have carried such a broadcast. The
      production utilized CBS''s video, but with Spanish-language graphics provided
      by ESPN, and its "Monday Night Football" commentary crew of Alvaro Martin, Raul
      Allegre, and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe. ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game
      and post-game coverage, while Martin, Allegre, and Sutcliffe also contributed
      reports for the English-language ESPN as part of efforts to promote the simulcast.
      ESPN Deportes'' vice president of programming Freddy Rolon felt that dedicated
      Spanish-language coverage appealed better to Hispanic viewers than Spanish commentary
      on the SAP audio channel, going on to say that "I have family members who watch
      Spanish language television and they don''t know where that SAP button is to
      begin with".


      As opposed to broadcasts of primetime series, CBS broadcast special episodes
      of its late-night talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50, beginning
      with a special episode of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" following the
      game. Following a break for late local programming, CBS also aired a special
      episode of "The Late Late Show with James Corden".


      With an average TV audience of 111.9 million, the game was the third most-watched
      Super Bowl—and third most-watched U.S. program—in history, according to the
      Nielsen ratings. It was also the most-watched program of all-time in terms of
      total audience, 167-million, which measures those who viewed at least six minutes
      of the broadcast. Average viewership is the industry standard for determining
      television ratings, while total audience is a supplemental metric. The Spanish-language
      broadcast on ESPN Deportes was seen by an average of 472,000 viewers; it ranked
      behind Super Bowl XLVIII as the second-most-watched Spanish-language cable telecast
      in U.S. history, outside of soccer games.


      CBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $5,000,000, a record
      high price for a Super Bowl ad. As of January 26, the advertisements had not
      yet sold out. CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering
      time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game, meaning that
      for the first time, digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising
      in pattern with the television broadcast. This would be the final year in a
      multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer
      to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount. It was also
      the final year that Doritos, a longtime sponsor of the game, held its "Crash
      the Super Bowl" contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads
      for a chance to have it aired during the game. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company
      also made their Super Bowl debut, Hyundai placed in both first and fifth place
      respectively on "USA Today"s Super Bowl Ad Meter survey, with their ads "First
      Date" (for the Hyundai Genesis) and "Ryanville" (for the 2017 Hyundai Elantra).


      First-time advertisers at Super Bowl 50 included Amazon.com, Colgate toothpaste,
      Death Wish Coffee (who beat 10 other small businesses in a contest held by Intuit,
      who paid for the ad time as a prize), LG Electronics, Marmot, Nintendo (promoting
      the 20th anniversary of the "Pokémon" franchise), PayPal, and SoFi.


      20th Century Fox, Lionsgate, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios and Walt
      Disney Studios paid for movie trailers to be aired during the Super Bowl. Fox
      paid for "Deadpool", "", "" and "Eddie the Eagle", Lionsgate paid for "Gods
      of Egypt", Paramount paid for "" and "10 Cloverfield Lane", Universal paid for
      "The Secret Life of Pets" and the debut trailer for "Jason Bourne" and Disney
      paid for "", "The Jungle Book" and "Alice Through the Looking Glass".


      Westwood One carried the game throughout North America, with Kevin Harlan as
      play-by-play announcer, Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts, and
      James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters. Jim Gray anchored the pre-game
      and halftime coverage.


      The flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team carried their
      local play-by-play calls. In Denver, KOA (850 AM) and KRFX (103.5 FM) carried
      the game, with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary.
      In North Carolina, WBT (1110 AM) carried the game, with Mick Mixon on play-by-play
      and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary. WBT also simulcast the
      game on its sister station WBT-FM (99.3 FM), based in Chester, South Carolina.
      As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations, the local broadcasts were audible
      over much of the western United States after sunset (for Denver) and the eastern
      United States throughout the game (for Carolina). In accordance with contractual
      rules, the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks either
      carried the Westwood One feed or did not air the game at all.


      In the United Kingdom, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra carried the
      contest. As in previous years, the BBC aired its own commercial-free British
      English broadcast, with Greg Brady, Darren Fletcher and Rocky Boiman on commentary.


      In honor of the 50th Super Bowl, the pregame ceremony featured the on-field
      introduction of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players. Bart
      Starr (MVP of Super Bowls I and II) and Chuck Howley (MVP of Super Bowl V) appeared
      via video. The late Harvey Martin, co-MVP of Super Bowl XII who died in 2001,
      was acknowledged when the other co-MVP of Super Bowl XII, Randy White, was introduced.
      Peyton Manning (MVP of Super Bowl XLI and the Broncos'' starting quarterback
      for the game) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game. This ceremony
      continued a ten-year tradition (starting with Super Bowl XX and then repeated
      in Super Bowl XXX and Super Bowl XL) in which past Super Bowl MVPs were honored
      before the game.


      Lady Gaga sang the national anthem, while Marlee Matlin simultaneously performed
      an American Sign Language (ASL) version of it. Matlin also signed an a cappella
      version of "America the Beautiful", which was sung by a U.S. Armed Forces chorus.


      In late November 2015, reports surfaced stating that "multiple acts" would perform
      during the halftime show. On December 3, the league confirmed that the show
      would be headlined by the British rock band Coldplay. On January 7, 2016, Pepsi
      confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé, who headlined the Super Bowl
      XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single "Hymn for the
      Weekend" (which was removed from the setlist before the game), would be making
      an appearance. Bruno Mars, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show,
      and Mark Ronson (Mars''s collaborator on "Uptown Funk") also performed.


      Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong. Peyton Manning completed
      an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre
      Caldwell. A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to
      the Panthers 14-yard line, but Carolina''s defense dug in over the next three
      plays. First, linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss.
      Then after an incompletion, Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain
      on third down, forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus
      34-yard field goal. The score marked the first time in the entire postseason
      that Carolina was facing a deficit.

      After each team punted, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete
      a 24-yard pass to Jerricho Cotchery, but the call was ruled an incompletion
      and upheld after a replay challenge. CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey
      stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass
      was complete. Two plays later, on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line, linebacker
      Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton''s hands while sacking him, and Malik
      Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown, giving the team
      a 10–0 lead. This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since
      Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season.


      After a punt from both teams, Carolina got on track with a 9-play, 73-yard scoring
      drive. Newton completed all four of his pass attempts for 51 yards and rushed
      twice for 25 yards, while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard
      touchdown run, cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter.
      Later on, Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman''s short 28-yard
      punt surrounded by Panthers players, but none of them attempted to make a tackle,
      apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch. Norwood had not done so,
      and with no resistance around him, he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard
      return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line. Despite
      Denver''s excellent field position, they could not get the ball into the end
      zone, so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7.


      On Carolina''s next possession, fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being
      tackled by safety Darian Stewart, which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered
      on the Broncos 40-yard line. However, the Panthers soon took the ball back when
      defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted
      it, returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left
      on the clock. The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and
      had to punt. After a Denver punt, Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line.
      But with 11 seconds left and no timeouts left, Newton was sacked by DeMarcus
      Ware causing time for the half to expire.


      The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half
      when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line
      on their second offensive play. But the Broncos defense halted the drive on
      the 26-yard line, and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights
      on a 44-yard field goal attempt. After the miss, Manning completed a pair of
      passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards, setting up McManus''
      33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead. Carolina got off to another
      strong start after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey
      Brown. But once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton
      pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J.
      Ward. Ward fumbled the ball deep in Denver territory during the return, but
      Trevathan was able to recover the ball enabling Denver to keep possession.

      There would be no more scoring in the third quarter, but early in the fourth,
      the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line. On the next play, Ealy knocked
      the ball out of Manning''s hand as he was winding up for a pass, and then recovered
      it for Carolina on the 50-yard line. A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and
      a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano''s 39-yard field goal, cutting the
      Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10. The next three drives of the game would
      end in punts.


      With 4:51 left in regulation, Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line
      with a chance to mount a game-winning drive, and soon faced 3rd-and-9. On the
      next play, Miller stripped the ball away from Newton, and after several players
      dove for it, it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward, who
      returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line. Newton was the third player
      to attempt a recovery (following Ware and Mike Remmers) of the ball and while
      various angles appeared to show that he had a decent probability of recovery
      if he''d dived in his attempt, Newton instead hesitated and then tried to drop
      on top of the ball, which failed. This split second decision later earned him
      criticism. Meanwhile, Denver''s offense was kept out of the end zone for three
      plays, but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new
      set of downs. Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed
      a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion, giving Denver a 24–10 lead
      with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away. Carolina had two more
      drives and managed one first down between them before the game ended.


      Manning finished the game 13 of 23 for 141 yards with one interception, two
      fumbles, and was sacked 5 times. Sanders was his top receiver with six receptions
      for 83 yards. Anderson was the game''s leading rusher with 90 yards and a touchdown,
      along with four receptions for 10 yards. Miller had six total tackles (five
      solo), 2½ sacks, and two forced fumbles. Ware had five total tackles and two
      sacks. Ward had seven total tackles, a fumble recovery, and an interception.
      McManus made all four of his field goals, making him perfect on all 11 attempts
      during the post-season.


      Newton completed 18 of 41 passes for 265 yards with one interception, two fumbles,
      and was sacked 6 times. He was also his team''s leading rusher with 45 yards
      on six carries. Brown caught four passes for 80 yards, while Ginn had four receptions
      for 74 yards. Ginn was sacked once on a trick play. Ealy was the top defensive
      performer for Carolina with four total tackles, three sacks, a forced fumble,
      a fumble recovery, and an interception. Defensive end Charles Johnson had four
      total tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble. Linebacker Luke Kuechly had 11 total
      tackles and a sack, while Thomas Davis had seven total tackles, despite playing
      just two weeks after breaking his right arm in the NFC title game.


      Super Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams. Denver won
      despite being massively outgained in total yards (315 to 194) and first downs
      (21 to 11). Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever
      by a Super Bowl winning team, as the previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore
      Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. Only seven other teams had ever gained fewer than
      200 yards in a Super Bowl, and all of them had lost. This was the first Super
      Bowl since Super Bowl XXXVI that the winning team scored only a single offensive
      touchdown, although the Broncos defense had earlier in the game scored a touchdown
      from a fumble recovery in the end zone. The Broncos'' seven sacks tied a Super
      Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. Manning was sacked five
      times by the Panthers, giving this game highest total (12) of combined sacks
      in Super Bowl history. Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks,
      and is the only such player to do so and record an interception. Jordan Norwood''s
      61-yard punt return set a new record, surpassing the old record of 45 yards
      set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII. Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down,
      while Carolina was 3-of-15. The two teams'' combined third down conversion percentage
      of 13.8 was the lowest in Super Bowl history. Manning and Newton had quarterback
      passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4, respectively, and their added total of 112
      is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl. Manning became
      the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39, the first quarterback
      ever to win a Super Bowl starting for two different teams, and the first quarterback
      ever to win 200 games (regular season and postseason) as a starter. Gary Kubiak
      became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went
      to the Super Bowl with as a player.


      Manning announced his retirement from the NFL a month after the Super Bowl.
      This was also the final game in the career of Panthers defensive lineman Jared
      Allen, who retired as the NFL''s ninth all-time leader in sacks.

      On September 8, 2016, the Broncos hosted the Panthers to open the 2016 NFL regular
      season. It was the first meeting of both Super Bowl participants during Week
      1 of the following season since the 1970 season when the Minnesota Vikings and
      Kansas City Chiefs held a rematch of Super Bowl IV to kick off the post-merger
      era of the NFL. The Broncos prevailed 21-20 as Carolina missed a field goal
      attempt to end the game.

      Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the
      National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season. The American Football Conference
      (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference (NFC)
      champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to win their third Super Bowl championship.
      The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi''s Stadium in Santa Clara,
      California (located in the San Francisco Bay Area). As this was the 50th Super
      Bowl, the league emphasized the "golden anniversary" with various gold-themed
      initiatives during the 2015 season, as well as suspending the tradition of naming
      each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been
      known as "Super Bowl L"), so the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals
      50.


      The Panthers finished the regular season with a 15–1 record, racking up the
      league''s top offense, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable
      Player (MVP). They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49–15 in the NFC Championship
      Game and advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance since the franchise
      was founded in 1995. The Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record,
      thanks to having the league''s top defense, and despite the struggles of starting
      quarterback Peyton Manning; they defeated the defending Super Bowl champion
      New England Patriots 20–18 in the AFC Championship Game. They joined the Patriots,
      Dallas Cowboys, and Pittsburgh Steelers as one of four teams that have made
      eight appearances in the Super Bowl.


      In one of the most defensive Super Bowl matchups in NFL history, the Broncos
      took an early lead in Super Bowl 50 and never trailed. Denver recorded seven
      sacks and forced three turnovers. Carolina likewise kept pace by recording five
      sacks and forcing two turnovers. Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super
      Bowl MVP. This game was also the final game of Peyton Manning''s career; he
      announced his retirement on March 7, 2016.


      CBS'' broadcast of the game was the third most-watched program in American television
      history with an average of 111.9 million viewers. The network charged an average
      of $5 million for a 30-second commercial during the game. The Super Bowl 50
      halftime show was headlined by Coldplay, with special guest performers Beyoncé
      and Bruno Mars.


      In early 2012, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the league planned
      to make the 50th Super Bowl "spectacular" and that it would be "an important
      game for us as a league".


      Cities included in early discussions or that submitted bids included:



      The league eventually narrowed the bids to three sites: New Orleans'' Mercedes-Benz
      Superdome, Miami''s Sun Life Stadium, and the San Francisco Bay Area''s Levi''s
      Stadium.


      The league announced on October 16, 2012, that the two finalists were Sun Life
      Stadium and Levi''s Stadium. The South Florida/Miami area has previously hosted
      the event 10 times (tied for most with New Orleans), with the most recent one
      being Super Bowl XLIV in 2010. The San Francisco Bay Area last hosted in 1985
      (Super Bowl XIX), held at Stanford Stadium in Stanford, California, won by the
      home team 49ers. The Miami bid depended on whether the stadium underwent renovations.
      However, on May 3, 2013, the Florida legislature refused to approve the funding
      plan to pay for the renovations, dealing a significant blow to Miami''s chances.


      On May 21, 2013, NFL owners at their spring meetings in Boston voted and awarded
      the game to Levi''s Stadium. The $1.2 billion stadium opened in 2014. It is
      the first Super Bowl held in the San Francisco Bay Area since Super Bowl XIX
      in 1985, and the first in California since Super Bowl XXXVII took place in San
      Diego in 2003.


      For the third straight season, the number one seeds in the NFC and AFC, the
      Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos, met in the Super Bowl. The game also featured
      the league''s top scoring offense (Panthers) against the league''s top defense
      (Broncos). The Panthers became the 10th team since 1960 to have lost just one
      game during the regular season, and the sixth team ever to have a 15–1 record.
      It was their second Super Bowl appearance; the other was Super Bowl XXXVIII.
      The Broncos became the fourth team to have eight Super Bowl appearances. It
      was their second appearance in three years, having also reached Super Bowl XLVIII.
      Coincidentally, John Fox was the head coach of each team in their previous Super
      Bowl appearance.


      Despite waiving long-time running back DeAngelo Williams and losing top wide
      receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn ACL in the preseason, the Carolina Panthers
      had their best regular season in franchise history, becoming the seventh team
      to win at least 15 regular season games since the league expanded to a 16-game
      schedule in . Carolina started the season 14–0, not only setting franchise records
      for the best start and the longest single-season winning streak, but also posting
      the best start to a season by an NFC team in NFL history, breaking the 13–0
      record previously shared with the 2009 New Orleans Saints and the 2011 Green
      Bay Packers. With their NFC-best 15–1 regular season record, the Panthers clinched
      home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs for the first time in franchise
      history. Ten players were selected to the Pro Bowl (the most in franchise history)
      along with eight All-Pro selections.


      The Panthers'' offense, which led the NFL in scoring (500 points), was loaded
      with talent, boasting six Pro Bowl selections. Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton
      had one of his best seasons, throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 yards,
      while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns (35 passing,
      10 rushing), a career-low 10 interceptions, and a career-best quarterback rating
      of 99.4. Newton''s leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen, who caught a
      career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns, and wide receiver
      Ted Ginn Jr., who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns; Ginn also
      rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards. Other key receivers
      included veteran Jerricho Cotchery (39 receptions for 485 yards), rookie Devin
      Funchess (31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns), and second-year
      receiver Corey Brown (31 receptions for 447 yards). The Panthers'' backfield
      featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart, who led the team with 989 rushing
      yards and six touchdowns in 13 games, along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert,
      who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards. Carolina''s
      offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections: center Ryan Kalil and
      guard Trai Turner.


      The Panthers'' defense gave up just 308 points, ranking sixth in the league,
      while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl
      selections. Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with
      11, while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two. Fellow lineman Mario
      Addison added 6½ sacks. The Panthers defensive line also featured veteran defensive
      end Jared Allen, a 5-time Pro Bowl selection, who was the NFL''s active career
      sack leader with 136, along with defensive end Kony Ealy, who had five sacks
      in just nine starts. Behind them, two of the Panthers'' three starting linebackers
      were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl: Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly. Davis
      compiled 5½ sacks, four forced fumbles, and four interceptions, while Kuechly
      led the team in tackles (118) forced two fumbles, and intercepted four passes
      of his own. Carolina''s secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman, who
      led the team with a career high seven interceptions, while also racking up 88
      tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman, who developed into a shutdown corner
      during the season and had four interceptions, two of which were returned for
      touchdowns.


      After losing in the divisional round of the playoffs during three of the previous
      four seasons, the Denver Broncos'' general manager John Elway made numerous
      coaching changes, including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox, who had
      won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach, being
      replaced in that role by Gary Kubiak, Elway''s former backup quarterback and
      former Broncos offensive coordinator. Wade Phillips, a former Broncos head coach,
      returned to the team to serve his second stint as defensive coordinator, succeeding
      Jack Del Rio who had left to take the head coaching vacancy at the Oakland Raiders.
      The team''s 43–8 loss in Super Bowl XLVIII two years earlier, despite holding
      the regular season''s top offense, resulted in Elway signing defensive end DeMarcus
      Ware, cornerback Aqib Talib, safety T. J. Ward, and wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders
      for the 2014 season.


      Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone
      blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning''s shotgun passing style,
      but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well
      as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the
      Indianapolis Colts in , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he
      had suffered since the summer. In addition, Manning was getting old, as he turned
      39 in the 2015 off-season. Though the team had a 7–0 start, Manning led the
      NFL in interceptions. In Week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar
      fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL''s all-time record for career passing
      yards in this game, but after throwing four interceptions, he was benched in
      favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for
      most of the remainder of the regular season. After a slow start in Denver''s
      final regular season game against San Diego, Osweiler was benched leading to
      Manning''s return. Manning re-claimed the starting quarterback position for
      the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to
      clinch the AFC''s No. 1 seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, who
      replaced his predecessor''s complicated read-and-react scheme with a simple
      aggressive approach of attacking the ball, the Broncos'' defense ranked No.
      1 in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous
      three seasons, the team continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise
      records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense,
      the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field
      advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.


      Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating, throwing for
      2,249 yards and nine touchdowns, with 17 interceptions. In contrast, Osweiler
      threw for 1,967 yards, 10 touchdowns and six interceptions for a rating of 86.4.
      Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105 receptions for 1,304
      yards and six touchdowns, while Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes for 1,135
      yards and six scores, while adding another 106 yards returning punts. Tight
      end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions
      for 517 yards. Running back C. J. Anderson was the team''s leading rusher 863
      yards and seven touchdowns, while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards. Running
      back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards, five touchdowns,
      24 receptions, and a 4.2 yards per carry average. Overall, the offense ranked
      19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections.


      The Broncos'' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed (4,530) for the
      first time in franchise history, and fourth in points allowed (296). Defensive
      ends Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson each had 5½ sacks. Pro Bowl linebacker Von
      Miller led the team with 11 sacks, forced four fumbles, and recovered three.
      Linebacker DeMarcus Ware was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the ninth
      time in his career, ranking second on the team with 7½ sacks. Linebacker Brandon
      Marshall led the team in total tackles with 109, while Danny Trevathan ranked
      second with 102 tackles. Cornerbacks Aqib Talib (three interceptions) and Chris
      Harris Jr. (two interceptions) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the
      defense, though none of the players selected for the Pro Bowl participated due
      to the Broncos reaching Super Bowl 50.


      The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round, running up a
      31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious second half comeback attempt
      to win 31–24, avenging their elimination from a year earlier. The Panthers then
      blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game, 49–15, racking
      up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers.


      The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round, 23–16,
      by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game. They then defeated
      the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship
      Game, 20–18, by intercepting a pass on New England''s 2-point conversion attempt
      with 17 seconds left on the clock and recovering a subsequent onside kick attempt.


      Carolina suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis, an 11-year veteran who
      had already overcome three ACL tears in his career, went down with a broken
      arm in the NFC Championship Game. Despite this, he insisted he would still find
      a way to play in the Super Bowl. His prediction turned out to be accurate and
      he made it into the starting lineup.


      Peyton Manning reached his fourth Super Bowl, with appearances under as many
      head coaches (Tony Dungy, Jim Caldwell, John Fox and Gary Kubiak). He became
      the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls.
      He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39. The
      past record was held by John Elway, who led the Broncos to victory in Super
      Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver''s Executive Vice President of
      Football Operations and General Manager.


      Manning and Newton set the record for the largest age difference between opposing
      Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days (Manning was 39, Newton was
      26). In addition, this was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on
      both teams who was the #1 pick in their draft classes. Manning was the #1 selection
      of the 1998 NFL Draft, while Newton was picked first in 2011. The matchup also
      pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other: Newton for Carolina
      and Von Miller for Denver.


      With Ron Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl
      XX, and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos'' defeats in Super
      Bowls XXI and XXIV, this was the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches
      played in the game themselves; coincidentally, the coaches they had played under,
      Mike Ditka (Rivera) and Dan Reeves (Kubiak), not only had Super Bowl playing
      experience themselves, but had done so as teammates with the Dallas Cowboys
      in Super Bowls V and VI (and worked together as Cowboys assistant coaches for
      Super Bowls X, XII and XIII).


      Concerns were raised over whether Levi''s Stadium''s field was of a high enough
      quality to host a Super Bowl; during the inaugural season, the field had to
      be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues, and earlier in the 2015 season,
      a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker,
      causing him to slip and miss a field goal, although the field has not had any
      major issues since. As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass
      stadiums, the NFL re-sodded the hybrid Bermuda 419 turf playing surface prior
      to the game; NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the
      field was in "great shape" for the game. However, the turf showed problems throughout
      the game, with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the
      game and players slipping during plays all throughout the game.


      As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams,
      the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants.
      Elway stated, "We''ve had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms." The Broncos
      last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII,
      Elway''s last game as Denver QB, when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19.
      In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII, Denver wore blue jerseys,
      which was their primary color at the time. They also lost Super Bowl XXI when
      they wore white jerseys, but they are 0–4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange
      jerseys, losing in Super Bowl XII, XXII, XXIV, and XLVIII. The only other AFC
      champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl
      was the Pittsburgh Steelers; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super
      Bowl XL 10 seasons prior. The Broncos'' decision to wear white meant the Panthers
      would wear their standard home uniform: black jerseys with silver pants.


      The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San
      Jose Marriott. The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the
      Santa Clara Marriott.


      On June 4, 2014, the NFL announced that the game would be branded with Arabic
      numerals as "Super Bowl 50"—rather than with Roman numerals, a practice established
      at Super Bowl V under which the game would have been known as "Super Bowl L".
      NFL creative director Shandon Melvin, explained that a primary reason for the
      change was the difficulty in designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the
      letter "L" using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV.
      He noted that "L" was harder to design around as it is asymmetrical unlike other
      Roman numerals, and also showed concerns that use of the letter "L" could be
      interpreted as the "loser" hand gesture. 73 different mockups, incorporating
      either "L" or "50", were designed before the final design was chosen, which
      featured large numerals colored in gold behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead
      of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo.


      Tying into the game''s "golden anniversary," various gold-themed promotions
      and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season. The league adopted
      a gold-tinted logo, which was implemented across all of the NFL''s properties
      and painted on fields during the season. The numbering of the 50-yard line on
      fields was colored gold, and beginning on week 7, all sideline jackets and hats
      featured gold-trimmed logos. Gold footballs were given to each high school that
      has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl, and "homecoming" events
      were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games.


      Ten themed "50" statues were placed in locations across San Francisco to promote
      the game; however, due to the negativity towards the game by residents of the
      city, the statues notably became the target of vandals, with the "SUPER BOWL
      50" lettering on their bases re-arranged to form other phrases such as "SUPERB
      OWL", "SUP BRO 50", and after the Alamo Square statue was toppled, "OOPS".


      The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. In
      addition, "Super Bowl City" opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The
      Embarcadero, featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area''s
      technology, culinary creations, and cultural diversity. More than a million
      people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super
      Bowl Week. San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence
      in this area "they are going to have to leave". San Francisco city supervisor
      Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city
      services in the amount of $5 million.


      In addition, there are $2 million worth of other ancillary events, including
      a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center, a beer, wine and food
      festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University, and a pep rally. A professional
      fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual donors, but
      still may need the city council to help fund the event. Additional funding will
      be provided by the city council, which has announced plans to set aside seed
      funding for the event.


      The game''s media day, which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior
      to the game, was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as "Super Bowl Opening
      Night". The event was held on February 1, 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose. Alongside
      the traditional media availabilities, the event featured an opening ceremony
      with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge.


      For the first time, the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL have openly
      sought disabled veteran and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-owned businesses
      in Business Connect, the Super Bowl program that provides local companies with
      contracting opportunities in and around the Super Bowl. The host committee has
      already raised over $40 million through sponsors including Apple, Google, Yahoo!,
      Intel, Gap, Chevron, and Dignity Health.


      The Super Bowl 50 Host Committee has vowed to be "the most giving Super Bowl
      ever", and will dedicate 25 percent of all money it raises for philanthropic
      causes in the Bay Area. The committee created the 50 fund as its philanthropic
      initiative and focuses on providing grants to aid with youth development, community
      investment and sustainable environments.


      In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that all Super Bowl champions receive,
      the winning team also received a large, 18-karat gold-plated "50". Each digit
      weighs for a total of . Like the Lombardi Trophy, the "50" was designed by Tiffany
      & Co.


      After putting out a call for volunteers in June 2015, over 450 volunteers helped
      to make the Super Bowl 50 Tour happen. More than 5,000 volunteers were on hand
      to help with events leading up to, during and after Super Bowl 50 as well. Volunteers
      signed up for a minimum of 3–4 hour shifts, and some volunteers gave more than
      200 hours of their time over the course of the week. As a thank you for volunteering,
      volunteers were gifted backpacks and uniforms.


      In the United States, the game was televised by CBS, as part of a cycle between
      the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL. The network''s lead
      broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest, with Tracy Wolfson
      and Evan Washburn on the sidelines. CBS introduced new features during the telecast,
      including pylon cameras and microphones along with "EyeVision 360"—an array
      of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree
      view of plays and "bullet time" effects. (An earlier version of "EyeVision"
      was last used in Super Bowl XXXV; for Super Bowl 50, the cameras were upgraded
      to 5K resolution.) CBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com,
      and the CBS Sports apps on tablets, Windows 10, Xbox One and other digital media
      players (such as Chromecast and Roku). Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity,
      streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via
      the NFL Mobile service.


      On December 28, 2015, ESPN announced that they had reached an agreement with
      CBS and the NFL to provide a dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of Super Bowl
      50, airing on ESPN Deportes and streaming on WatchESPN, featuring commentary
      and surrounding coverage in the language; unlike Fox and NBC, CBS does not have
      a Spanish-language cable network that could have carried such a broadcast. The
      production utilized CBS''s video, but with Spanish-language graphics provided
      by ESPN, and its "Monday Night Football" commentary crew of Alvaro Martin, Raul
      Allegre, and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe. ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game
      and post-game coverage, while Martin, Allegre, and Sutcliffe also contributed
      reports for the English-language ESPN as part of efforts to promote the simulcast.
      ESPN Deportes'' vice president of programming Freddy Rolon felt that dedicated
      Spanish-language coverage appealed better to Hispanic viewers than Spanish commentary
      on the SAP audio channel, going on to say that "I have family members who watch
      Spanish language television and they don''t know where that SAP button is to
      begin with".


      As opposed to broadcasts of primetime series, CBS broadcast special episodes
      of its late-night talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50, beginning
      with a special episode of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" following the
      game. Following a break for late local programming, CBS also aired a special
      episode of "The Late Late Show with James Corden".


      With an average TV audience of 111.9 million, the game was the third most-watched
      Super Bowl—and third most-watched U.S. program—in history, according to the
      Nielsen ratings. It was also the most-watched program of all-time in terms of
      total audience, 167-million, which measures those who viewed at least six minutes
      of the broadcast. Average viewership is the industry standard for determining
      television ratings, while total audience is a supplemental metric. The Spanish-language
      broadcast on ESPN Deportes was seen by an average of 472,000 viewers; it ranked
      behind Super Bowl XLVIII as the second-most-watched Spanish-language cable telecast
      in U.S. history, outside of soccer games.


      CBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $5,000,000, a record
      high price for a Super Bowl ad. As of January 26, the advertisements had not
      yet sold out. CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering
      time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game, meaning that
      for the first time, digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising
      in pattern with the television broadcast. This would be the final year in a
      multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer
      to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount. It was also
      the final year that Doritos, a longtime sponsor of the game, held its "Crash
      the Super Bowl" contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads
      for a chance to have it aired during the game. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company
      also made their Super Bowl debut, Hyundai placed in both first and fifth place
      respectively on "USA Today"s Super Bowl Ad Meter survey, with their ads "First
      Date" (for the Hyundai Genesis) and "Ryanville" (for the 2017 Hyundai Elantra).


      First-time advertisers at Super Bowl 50 included Amazon.com, Colgate toothpaste,
      Death Wish Coffee (who beat 10 other small businesses in a contest held by Intuit,
      who paid for the ad time as a prize), LG Electronics, Marmot, Nintendo (promoting
      the 20th anniversary of the "Pokémon" franchise), PayPal, and SoFi.


      20th Century Fox, Lionsgate, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios and Walt
      Disney Studios paid for movie trailers to be aired during the Super Bowl. Fox
      paid for "Deadpool", "", "" and "Eddie the Eagle", Lionsgate paid for "Gods
      of Egypt", Paramount paid for "" and "10 Cloverfield Lane", Universal paid for
      "The Secret Life of Pets" and the debut trailer for "Jason Bourne" and Disney
      paid for "", "The Jungle Book" and "Alice Through the Looking Glass".


      Westwood One carried the game throughout North America, with Kevin Harlan as
      play-by-play announcer, Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts, and
      James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters. Jim Gray anchored the pre-game
      and halftime coverage.


      The flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team carried their
      local play-by-play calls. In Denver, KOA (850 AM) and KRFX (103.5 FM) carried
      the game, with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary.
      In North Carolina, WBT (1110 AM) carried the game, with Mick Mixon on play-by-play
      and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary. WBT also simulcast the
      game on its sister station WBT-FM (99.3 FM), based in Chester, South Carolina.
      As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations, the local broadcasts were audible
      over much of the western United States after sunset (for Denver) and the eastern
      United States throughout the game (for Carolina). In accordance with contractual
      rules, the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks either
      carried the Westwood One feed or did not air the game at all.


      In the United Kingdom, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra carried the
      contest. As in previous years, the BBC aired its own commercial-free British
      English broadcast, with Greg Brady, Darren Fletcher and Rocky Boiman on commentary.


      In honor of the 50th Super Bowl, the pregame ceremony featured the on-field
      introduction of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players. Bart
      Starr (MVP of Super Bowls I and II) and Chuck Howley (MVP of Super Bowl V) appeared
      via video. The late Harvey Martin, co-MVP of Super Bowl XII who died in 2001,
      was acknowledged when the other co-MVP of Super Bowl XII, Randy White, was introduced.
      Peyton Manning (MVP of Super Bowl XLI and the Broncos'' starting quarterback
      for the game) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game. This ceremony
      continued a ten-year tradition (starting with Super Bowl XX and then repeated
      in Super Bowl XXX and Super Bowl XL) in which past Super Bowl MVPs were honored
      before the game.


      Lady Gaga sang the national anthem, while Marlee Matlin simultaneously performed
      an American Sign Language (ASL) version of it. Matlin also signed an a cappella
      version of "America the Beautiful", which was sung by a U.S. Armed Forces chorus.


      In late November 2015, reports surfaced stating that "multiple acts" would perform
      during the halftime show. On December 3, the league confirmed that the show
      would be headlined by the British rock band Coldplay. On January 7, 2016, Pepsi
      confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé, who headlined the Super Bowl
      XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single "Hymn for the
      Weekend" (which was removed from the setlist before the game), would be making
      an appearance. Bruno Mars, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show,
      and Mark Ronson (Mars''s collaborator on "Uptown Funk") also performed.


      Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong. Peyton Manning completed
      an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre
      Caldwell. A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to
      the Panthers 14-yard line, but Carolina''s defense dug in over the next three
      plays. First, linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss.
      Then after an incompletion, Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain
      on third down, forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus
      34-yard field goal. The score marked the first time in the entire postseason
      that Carolina was facing a deficit.

      After each team punted, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete
      a 24-yard pass to Jerricho Cotchery, but the call was ruled an incompletion
      and upheld after a replay challenge. CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey
      stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass
      was complete. Two plays later, on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line, linebacker
      Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton''s hands while sacking him, and Malik
      Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown, giving the team
      a 10–0 lead. This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since
      Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season.


      After a punt from both teams, Carolina got on track with a 9-play, 73-yard scoring
      drive. Newton completed all four of his pass attempts for 51 yards and rushed
      twice for 25 yards, while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard
      touchdown run, cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter.
      Later on, Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman''s short 28-yard
      punt surrounded by Panthers players, but none of them attempted to make a tackle,
      apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch. Norwood had not done so,
      and with no resistance around him, he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard
      return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line. Despite
      Denver''s excellent field position, they could not get the ball into the end
      zone, so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7.


      On Carolina''s next possession, fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being
      tackled by safety Darian Stewart, which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered
      on the Broncos 40-yard line. However, the Panthers soon took the ball back when
      defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted
      it, returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left
      on the clock. The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and
      had to punt. After a Denver punt, Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line.
      But with 11 seconds left and no timeouts left, Newton was sacked by DeMarcus
      Ware causing time for the half to expire.


      The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half
      when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line
      on their second offensive play. But the Broncos defense halted the drive on
      the 26-yard line, and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights
      on a 44-yard field goal attempt. After the miss, Manning completed a pair of
      passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards, setting up McManus''
      33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead. Carolina got off to another
      strong start after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey
      Brown. But once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton
      pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J.
      Ward. Ward fumbled the ball deep in Denver territory during the return, but
      Trevathan was able to recover the ball enabling Denver to keep possession.

      There would be no more scoring in the third quarter, but early in the fourth,
      the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line. On the next play, Ealy knocked
      the ball out of Manning''s hand as he was winding up for a pass, and then recovered
      it for Carolina on the 50-yard line. A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and
      a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano''s 39-yard field goal, cutting the
      Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10. The next three drives of the game would
      end in punts.


      With 4:51 left in regulation, Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line
      with a chance to mount a game-winning drive, and soon faced 3rd-and-9. On the
      next play, Miller stripped the ball away from Newton, and after several players
      dove for it, it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward, who
      returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line. Newton was the third player
      to attempt a recovery (following Ware and Mike Remmers) of the ball and while
      various angles appeared to show that he had a decent probability of recovery
      if he''d dived in his attempt, Newton instead hesitated and then tried to drop
      on top of the ball, which failed. This split second decision later earned him
      criticism. Meanwhile, Denver''s offense was kept out of the end zone for three
      plays, but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new
      set of downs. Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed
      a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion, giving Denver a 24–10 lead
      with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away. Carolina had two more
      drives and managed one first down between them before the game ended.


      Manning finished the game 13 of 23 for 141 yards with one interception, two
      fumbles, and was sacked 5 times. Sanders was his top receiver with six receptions
      for 83 yards. Anderson was the game''s leading rusher with 90 yards and a touchdown,
      along with four receptions for 10 yards. Miller had six total tackles (five
      solo), 2½ sacks, and two forced fumbles. Ware had five total tackles and two
      sacks. Ward had seven total tackles, a fumble recovery, and an interception.
      McManus made all four of his field goals, making him perfect on all 11 attempts
      during the post-season.


      Newton completed 18 of 41 passes for 265 yards with one interception, two fumbles,
      and was sacked 6 times. He was also his team''s leading rusher with 45 yards
      on six carries. Brown caught four passes for 80 yards, while Ginn had four receptions
      for 74 yards. Ginn was sacked once on a trick play. Ealy was the top defensive
      performer for Carolina with four total tackles, three sacks, a forced fumble,
      a fumble recovery, and an interception. Defensive end Charles Johnson had four
      total tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble. Linebacker Luke Kuechly had 11 total
      tackles and a sack, while Thomas Davis had seven total tackles, despite playing
      just two weeks after breaking his right arm in the NFC title game.


      Super Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams. Denver won
      despite being massively outgained in total yards (315 to 194) and first downs
      (21 to 11). Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever
      by a Super Bowl winning team, as the previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore
      Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. Only seven other teams had ever gained fewer than
      200 yards in a Super Bowl, and all of them had lost. This was the first Super
      Bowl since Super Bowl XXXVI that the winning team scored only a single offensive
      touchdown, although the Broncos defense had earlier in the game scored a touchdown
      from a fumble recovery in the end zone. The Broncos'' seven sacks tied a Super
      Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. Manning was sacked five
      times by the Panthers, giving this game highest total (12) of combined sacks
      in Super Bowl history. Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks,
      and is the only such player to do so and record an interception. Jordan Norwood''s
      61-yard punt return set a new record, surpassing the old record of 45 yards
      set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII. Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down,
      while Carolina was 3-of-15. The two teams'' combined third down conversion percentage
      of 13.8 was the lowest in Super Bowl history. Manning and Newton had quarterback
      passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4, respectively, and their added total of 112
      is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl. Manning became
      the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39, the first quarterback
      ever to win a Super Bowl starting for two different teams, and the first quarterback
      ever to win 200 games (regular season and postseason) as a starter. Gary Kubiak
      became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went
      to the Super Bowl with as a player.


      Manning announced his retirement from the NFL a month after the Super Bowl.
      This was also the final game in the career of Panthers defensive lineman Jared
      Allen, who retired as the NFL''s ninth all-time leader in sacks.

      On September 8, 2016, the Broncos hosted the Panthers to open the 2016 NFL regular
      season. It was the first meeting of both Super Bowl participants during Week
      1 of the following season since the 1970 season when the Minnesota Vikings and
      Kansas City Chiefs held a rematch of Super Bowl IV to kick off the post-merger
      era of the NFL. The Broncos prevailed 21-20 as Carolina missed a field goal
      attempt to end the game.

      Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the
      National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season. The American Football Conference
      (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference (NFC)
      champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to win their third Super Bowl championship.
      The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi''s Stadium in Santa Clara,
      California (located in the San Francisco Bay Area). As this was the 50th Super
      Bowl, the league emphasized the "golden anniversary" with various gold-themed
      initiatives during the 2015 season, as well as suspending the tradition of naming
      each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been
      known as "Super Bowl L"), so the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals
      50.


      The Panthers finished the regular season with a 15–1 record, racking up the
      league''s top offense, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable
      Player (MVP). They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49–15 in the NFC Championship
      Game and advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance since the franchise
      was founded in 1995. The Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record,
      thanks to having the league''s top defense, and despite the struggles of starting
      quarterback Peyton Manning; they defeated the defending Super Bowl champion
      New England Patriots 20–18 in the AFC Championship Game. They joined the Patriots,
      Dallas Cowboys, and Pittsburgh Steelers as one of four teams that have made
      eight appearances in the Super Bowl.


      In one of the most defensive Super Bowl matchups in NFL history, the Broncos
      took an early lead in Super Bowl 50 and never trailed. Denver recorded seven
      sacks and forced three turnovers. Carolina likewise kept pace by recording five
      sacks and forcing two turnovers. Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super
      Bowl MVP. This game was also the final game of Peyton Manning''s career; he
      announced his retirement on March 7, 2016.


      CBS'' broadcast of the game was the third most-watched program in American television
      history with an average of 111.9 million viewers. The network charged an average
      of $5 million for a 30-second commercial during the game. The Super Bowl 50
      halftime show was headlined by Coldplay, with special guest performers Beyoncé
      and Bruno Mars.


      In early 2012, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the league planned
      to make the 50th Super Bowl "spectacular" and that it would be "an important
      game for us as a league".


      Cities included in early discussions or that submitted bids included:



      The league eventually narrowed the bids to three sites: New Orleans'' Mercedes-Benz
      Superdome, Miami''s Sun Life Stadium, and the San Francisco Bay Area''s Levi''s
      Stadium.


      The league announced on October 16, 2012, that the two finalists were Sun Life
      Stadium and Levi''s Stadium. The South Florida/Miami area has previously hosted
      the event 10 times (tied for most with New Orleans), with the most recent one
      being Super Bowl XLIV in 2010. The San Francisco Bay Area last hosted in 1985
      (Super Bowl XIX), held at Stanford Stadium in Stanford, California, won by the
      home team 49ers. The Miami bid depended on whether the stadium underwent renovations.
      However, on May 3, 2013, the Florida legislature refused to approve the funding
      plan to pay for the renovations, dealing a significant blow to Miami''s chances.


      On May 21, 2013, NFL owners at their spring meetings in Boston voted and awarded
      the game to Levi''s Stadium. The $1.2 billion stadium opened in 2014. It is
      the first Super Bowl held in the San Francisco Bay Area since Super Bowl XIX
      in 1985, and the first in California since Super Bowl XXXVII took place in San
      Diego in 2003.


      For the third straight season, the number one seeds in the NFC and AFC, the
      Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos, met in the Super Bowl. The game also featured
      the league''s top scoring offense (Panthers) against the league''s top defense
      (Broncos). The Panthers became the 10th team since 1960 to have lost just one
      game during the regular season, and the sixth team ever to have a 15–1 record.
      It was their second Super Bowl appearance; the other was Super Bowl XXXVIII.
      The Broncos became the fourth team to have eight Super Bowl appearances. It
      was their second appearance in three years, having also reached Super Bowl XLVIII.
      Coincidentally, John Fox was the head coach of each team in their previous Super
      Bowl appearance.


      Despite waiving long-time running back DeAngelo Williams and losing top wide
      receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn ACL in the preseason, the Carolina Panthers
      had their best regular season in franchise history, becoming the seventh team
      to win at least 15 regular season games since the league expanded to a 16-game
      schedule in . Carolina started the season 14–0, not only setting franchise records
      for the best start and the longest single-season winning streak, but also posting
      the best start to a season by an NFC team in NFL history, breaking the 13–0
      record previously shared with the 2009 New Orleans Saints and the 2011 Green
      Bay Packers. With their NFC-best 15–1 regular season record, the Panthers clinched
      home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs for the first time in franchise
      history. Ten players were selected to the Pro Bowl (the most in franchise history)
      along with eight All-Pro selections.


      The Panthers'' offense, which led the NFL in scoring (500 points), was loaded
      with talent, boasting six Pro Bowl selections. Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton
      had one of his best seasons, throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 yards,
      while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns (35 passing,
      10 rushing), a career-low 10 interceptions, and a career-best quarterback rating
      of 99.4. Newton''s leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen, who caught a
      career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns, and wide receiver
      Ted Ginn Jr., who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns; Ginn also
      rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards. Other key receivers
      included veteran Jerricho Cotchery (39 receptions for 485 yards), rookie Devin
      Funchess (31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns), and second-year
      receiver Corey Brown (31 receptions for 447 yards). The Panthers'' backfield
      featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart, who led the team with 989 rushing
      yards and six touchdowns in 13 games, along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert,
      who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards. Carolina''s
      offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections: center Ryan Kalil and
      guard Trai Turner.


      The Panthers'' defense gave up just 308 points, ranking sixth in the league,
      while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl
      selections. Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with
      11, while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two. Fellow lineman Mario
      Addison added 6½ sacks. The Panthers defensive line also featured veteran defensive
      end Jared Allen, a 5-time Pro Bowl selection, who was the NFL''s active career
      sack leader with 136, along with defensive end Kony Ealy, who had five sacks
      in just nine starts. Behind them, two of the Panthers'' three starting linebackers
      were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl: Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly. Davis
      compiled 5½ sacks, four forced fumbles, and four interceptions, while Kuechly
      led the team in tackles (118) forced two fumbles, and intercepted four passes
      of his own. Carolina''s secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman, who
      led the team with a career high seven interceptions, while also racking up 88
      tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman, who developed into a shutdown corner
      during the season and had four interceptions, two of which were returned for
      touchdowns.


      After losing in the divisional round of the playoffs during three of the previous
      four seasons, the Denver Broncos'' general manager John Elway made numerous
      coaching changes, including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox, who had
      won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach, being
      replaced in that role by Gary Kubiak, Elway''s former backup quarterback and
      former Broncos offensive coordinator. Wade Phillips, a former Broncos head coach,
      returned to the team to serve his second stint as defensive coordinator, succeeding
      Jack Del Rio who had left to take the head coaching vacancy at the Oakland Raiders.
      The team''s 43–8 loss in Super Bowl XLVIII two years earlier, despite holding
      the regular season''s top offense, resulted in Elway signing defensive end DeMarcus
      Ware, cornerback Aqib Talib, safety T. J. Ward, and wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders
      for the 2014 season.


      Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone
      blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning''s shotgun passing style,
      but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well
      as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the
      Indianapolis Colts in , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he
      had suffered since the summer. In addition, Manning was getting old, as he turned
      39 in the 2015 off-season. Though the team had a 7–0 start, Manning led the
      NFL in interceptions. In Week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar
      fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL''s all-time record for career passing
      yards in this game, but after throwing four interceptions, he was benched in
      favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for
      most of the remainder of the regular season. After a slow start in Denver''s
      final regular season game against San Diego, Osweiler was benched leading to
      Manning''s return. Manning re-claimed the starting quarterback position for
      the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to
      clinch the AFC''s No. 1 seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, who
      replaced his predecessor''s complicated read-and-react scheme with a simple
      aggressive approach of attacking the ball, the Broncos'' defense ranked No.
      1 in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous
      three seasons, the team continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise
      records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense,
      the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field
      advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.


      Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating, throwing for
      2,249 yards and nine touchdowns, with 17 interceptions. In contrast, Osweiler
      threw for 1,967 yards, 10 touchdowns and six interceptions for a rating of 86.4.
      Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105 receptions for 1,304
      yards and six touchdowns, while Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes for 1,135
      yards and six scores, while adding another 106 yards returning punts. Tight
      end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions
      for 517 yards. Running back C. J. Anderson was the team''s leading rusher 863
      yards and seven touchdowns, while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards. Running
      back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards, five touchdowns,
      24 receptions, and a 4.2 yards per carry average. Overall, the offense ranked
      19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections.


      The Broncos'' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed (4,530) for the
      first time in franchise history, and fourth in points allowed (296). Defensive
      ends Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson each had 5½ sacks. Pro Bowl linebacker Von
      Miller led the team with 11 sacks, forced four fumbles, and recovered three.
      Linebacker DeMarcus Ware was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the ninth
      time in his career, ranking second on the team with 7½ sacks. Linebacker Brandon
      Marshall led the team in total tackles with 109, while Danny Trevathan ranked
      second with 102 tackles. Cornerbacks Aqib Talib (three interceptions) and Chris
      Harris Jr. (two interceptions) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the
      defense, though none of the players selected for the Pro Bowl participated due
      to the Broncos reaching Super Bowl 50.


      The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round, running up a
      31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious second half comeback attempt
      to win 31–24, avenging their elimination from a year earlier. The Panthers then
      blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game, 49–15, racking
      up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers.


      The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round, 23–16,
      by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game. They then defeated
      the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship
      Game, 20–18, by intercepting a pass on New England''s 2-point conversion attempt
      with 17 seconds left on the clock and recovering a subsequent onside kick attempt.


      Carolina suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis, an 11-year veteran who
      had already overcome three ACL tears in his career, went down with a broken
      arm in the NFC Championship Game. Despite this, he insisted he would still find
      a way to play in the Super Bowl. His prediction turned out to be accurate and
      he made it into the starting lineup.


      Peyton Manning reached his fourth Super Bowl, with appearances under as many
      head coaches (Tony Dungy, Jim Caldwell, John Fox and Gary Kubiak). He became
      the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls.
      He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39. The
      past record was held by John Elway, who led the Broncos to victory in Super
      Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver''s Executive Vice President of
      Football Operations and General Manager.


      Manning and Newton set the record for the largest age difference between opposing
      Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days (Manning was 39, Newton was
      26). In addition, this was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on
      both teams who was the #1 pick in their draft classes. Manning was the #1 selection
      of the 1998 NFL Draft, while Newton was picked first in 2011. The matchup also
      pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other: Newton for Carolina
      and Von Miller for Denver.


      With Ron Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl
      XX, and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos'' defeats in Super
      Bowls XXI and XXIV, this was the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches
      played in the game themselves; coincidentally, the coaches they had played under,
      Mike Ditka (Rivera) and Dan Reeves (Kubiak), not only had Super Bowl playing
      experience themselves, but had done so as teammates with the Dallas Cowboys
      in Super Bowls V and VI (and worked together as Cowboys assistant coaches for
      Super Bowls X, XII and XIII).


      Concerns were raised over whether Levi''s Stadium''s field was of a high enough
      quality to host a Super Bowl; during the inaugural season, the field had to
      be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues, and earlier in the 2015 season,
      a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker,
      causing him to slip and miss a field goal, although the field has not had any
      major issues since. As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass
      stadiums, the NFL re-sodded the hybrid Bermuda 419 turf playing surface prior
      to the game; NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the
      field was in "great shape" for the game. However, the turf showed problems throughout
      the game, with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the
      game and players slipping during plays all throughout the game.


      As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams,
      the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants.
      Elway stated, "We''ve had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms." The Broncos
      last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII,
      Elway''s last game as Denver QB, when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19.
      In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII, Denver wore blue jerseys,
      which was their primary color at the time. They also lost Super Bowl XXI when
      they wore white jerseys, but they are 0–4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange
      jerseys, losing in Super Bowl XII, XXII, XXIV, and XLVIII. The only other AFC
      champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl
      was the Pittsburgh Steelers; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super
      Bowl XL 10 seasons prior. The Broncos'' decision to wear white meant the Panthers
      would wear their standard home uniform: black jerseys with silver pants.


      The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San
      Jose Marriott. The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the
      Santa Clara Marriott.


      On June 4, 2014, the NFL announced that the game would be branded with Arabic
      numerals as "Super Bowl 50"—rather than with Roman numerals, a practice established
      at Super Bowl V under which the game would have been known as "Super Bowl L".
      NFL creative director Shandon Melvin, explained that a primary reason for the
      change was the difficulty in designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the
      letter "L" using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV.
      He noted that "L" was harder to design around as it is asymmetrical unlike other
      Roman numerals, and also showed concerns that use of the letter "L" could be
      interpreted as the "loser" hand gesture. 73 different mockups, incorporating
      either "L" or "50", were designed before the final design was chosen, which
      featured large numerals colored in gold behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead
      of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo.


      Tying into the game''s "golden anniversary," various gold-themed promotions
      and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season. The league adopted
      a gold-tinted logo, which was implemented across all of the NFL''s properties
      and painted on fields during the season. The numbering of the 50-yard line on
      fields was colored gold, and beginning on week 7, all sideline jackets and hats
      featured gold-trimmed logos. Gold footballs were given to each high school that
      has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl, and "homecoming" events
      were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games.


      Ten themed "50" statues were placed in locations across San Francisco to promote
      the game; however, due to the negativity towards the game by residents of the
      city, the statues notably became the target of vandals, with the "SUPER BOWL
      50" lettering on their bases re-arranged to form other phrases such as "SUPERB
      OWL", "SUP BRO 50", and after the Alamo Square statue was toppled, "OOPS".


      The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. In
      addition, "Super Bowl City" opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The
      Embarcadero, featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area''s
      technology, culinary creations, and cultural diversity. More than a million
      people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super
      Bowl Week. San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence
      in this area "they are going to have to leave". San Francisco city supervisor
      Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city
      services in the amount of $5 million.


      In addition, there are $2 million worth of other ancillary events, including
      a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center, a beer, wine and food
      festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University, and a pep rally. A professional
      fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual donors, but
      still may need the city council to help fund the event. Additional funding will
      be provided by the city council, which has announced plans to set aside seed
      funding for the event.


      The game''s media day, which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior
      to the game, was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as "Super Bowl Opening
      Night". The event was held on February 1, 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose. Alongside
      the traditional media availabilities, the event featured an opening ceremony
      with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge.


      For the first time, the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL have openly
      sought disabled veteran and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-owned businesses
      in Business Connect, the Super Bowl program that provides local companies with
      contracting opportunities in and around the Super Bowl. The host committee has
      already raised over $40 million through sponsors including Apple, Google, Yahoo!,
      Intel, Gap, Chevron, and Dignity Health.


      The Super Bowl 50 Host Committee has vowed to be "the most giving Super Bowl
      ever", and will dedicate 25 percent of all money it raises for philanthropic
      causes in the Bay Area. The committee created the 50 fund as its philanthropic
      initiative and focuses on providing grants to aid with youth development, community
      investment and sustainable environments.


      In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that all Super Bowl champions receive,
      the winning team also received a large, 18-karat gold-plated "50". Each digit
      weighs for a total of . Like the Lombardi Trophy, the "50" was designed by Tiffany
      & Co.


      After putting out a call for volunteers in June 2015, over 450 volunteers helped
      to make the Super Bowl 50 Tour happen. More than 5,000 volunteers were on hand
      to help with events leading up to, during and after Super Bowl 50 as well. Volunteers
      signed up for a minimum of 3–4 hour shifts, and some volunteers gave more than
      200 hours of their time over the course of the week. As a thank you for volunteering,
      volunteers were gifted backpacks and uniforms.


      In the United States, the game was televised by CBS, as part of a cycle between
      the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL. The network''s lead
      broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest, with Tracy Wolfson
      and Evan Washburn on the sidelines. CBS introduced new features during the telecast,
      including pylon cameras and microphones along with "EyeVision 360"—an array
      of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree
      view of plays and "bullet time" effects. (An earlier version of "EyeVision"
      was last used in Super Bowl XXXV; for Super Bowl 50, the cameras were upgraded
      to 5K resolution.) CBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com,
      and the CBS Sports apps on tablets, Windows 10, Xbox One and other digital media
      players (such as Chromecast and Roku). Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity,
      streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via
      the NFL Mobile service.


      On December 28, 2015, ESPN announced that they had reached an agreement with
      CBS and the NFL to provide a dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of Super Bowl
      50, airing on ESPN Deportes and streaming on WatchESPN, featuring commentary
      and surrounding coverage in the language; unlike Fox and NBC, CBS does not have
      a Spanish-language cable network that could have carried such a broadcast. The
      production utilized CBS''s video, but with Spanish-language graphics provided
      by ESPN, and its "Monday Night Football" commentary crew of Alvaro Martin, Raul
      Allegre, and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe. ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game
      and post-game coverage, while Martin, Allegre, and Sutcliffe also contributed
      reports for the English-language ESPN as part of efforts to promote the simulcast.
      ESPN Deportes'' vice president of programming Freddy Rolon felt that dedicated
      Spanish-language coverage appealed better to Hispanic viewers than Spanish commentary
      on the SAP audio channel, going on to say that "I have family members who watch
      Spanish language television and they don''t know where that SAP button is to
      begin with".


      As opposed to broadcasts of primetime series, CBS broadcast special episodes
      of its late-night talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50, beginning
      with a special episode of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" following the
      game. Following a break for late local programming, CBS also aired a special
      episode of "The Late Late Show with James Corden".


      With an average TV audience of 111.9 million, the game was the third most-watched
      Super Bowl—and third most-watched U.S. program—in history, according to the
      Nielsen ratings. It was also the most-watched program of all-time in terms of
      total audience, 167-million, which measures those who viewed at least six minutes
      of the broadcast. Average viewership is the industry standard for determining
      television ratings, while total audience is a supplemental metric. The Spanish-language
      broadcast on ESPN Deportes was seen by an average of 472,000 viewers; it ranked
      behind Super Bowl XLVIII as the second-most-watched Spanish-language cable telecast
      in U.S. history, outside of soccer games.


      CBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $5,000,000, a record
      high price for a Super Bowl ad. As of January 26, the advertisements had not
      yet sold out. CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering
      time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game, meaning that
      for the first time, digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising
      in pattern with the television broadcast. This would be the final year in a
      multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer
      to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount. It was also
      the final year that Doritos, a longtime sponsor of the game, held its "Crash
      the Super Bowl" contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads
      for a chance to have it aired during the game. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company
      also made their Super Bowl debut, Hyundai placed in both first and fifth place
      respectively on "USA Today"s Super Bowl Ad Meter survey, with their ads "First
      Date" (for the Hyundai Genesis) and "Ryanville" (for the 2017 Hyundai Elantra).


      First-time advertisers at Super Bowl 50 included Amazon.com, Colgate toothpaste,
      Death Wish Coffee (who beat 10 other small businesses in a contest held by Intuit,
      who paid for the ad time as a prize), LG Electronics, Marmot, Nintendo (promoting
      the 20th anniversary of the "Pokémon" franchise), PayPal, and SoFi.


      20th Century Fox, Lionsgate, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios and Walt
      Disney Studios paid for movie trailers to be aired during the Super Bowl. Fox
      paid for "Deadpool", "", "" and "Eddie the Eagle", Lionsgate paid for "Gods
      of Egypt", Paramount paid for "" and "10 Cloverfield Lane", Universal paid for
      "The Secret Life of Pets" and the debut trailer for "Jason Bourne" and Disney
      paid for "", "The Jungle Book" and "Alice Through the Looking Glass".


      Westwood One carried the game throughout North America, with Kevin Harlan as
      play-by-play announcer, Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts, and
      James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters. Jim Gray anchored the pre-game
      and halftime coverage.


      The flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team carried their
      local play-by-play calls. In Denver, KOA (850 AM) and KRFX (103.5 FM) carried
      the game, with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary.
      In North Carolina, WBT (1110 AM) carried the game, with Mick Mixon on play-by-play
      and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary. WBT also simulcast the
      game on its sister station WBT-FM (99.3 FM), based in Chester, South Carolina.
      As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations, the local broadcasts were audible
      over much of the western United States after sunset (for Denver) and the eastern
      United States throughout the game (for Carolina). In accordance with contractual
      rules, the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks either
      carried the Westwood One feed or did not air the game at all.


      In the United Kingdom, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra carried the
      contest. As in previous years, the BBC aired its own commercial-free British
      English broadcast, with Greg Brady, Darren Fletcher and Rocky Boiman on commentary.


      In honor of the 50th Super Bowl, the pregame ceremony featured the on-field
      introduction of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players. Bart
      Starr (MVP of Super Bowls I and II) and Chuck Howley (MVP of Super Bowl V) appeared
      via video. The late Harvey Martin, co-MVP of Super Bowl XII who died in 2001,
      was acknowledged when the other co-MVP of Super Bowl XII, Randy White, was introduced.
      Peyton Manning (MVP of Super Bowl XLI and the Broncos'' starting quarterback
      for the game) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game. This ceremony
      continued a ten-year tradition (starting with Super Bowl XX and then repeated
      in Super Bowl XXX and Super Bowl XL) in which past Super Bowl MVPs were honored
      before the game.


      Lady Gaga sang the national anthem, while Marlee Matlin simultaneously performed
      an American Sign Language (ASL) version of it. Matlin also signed an a cappella
      version of "America the Beautiful", which was sung by a U.S. Armed Forces chorus.


      In late November 2015, reports surfaced stating that "multiple acts" would perform
      during the halftime show. On December 3, the league confirmed that the show
      would be headlined by the British rock band Coldplay. On January 7, 2016, Pepsi
      confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé, who headlined the Super Bowl
      XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single "Hymn for the
      Weekend" (which was removed from the setlist before the game), would be making
      an appearance. Bruno Mars, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show,
      and Mark Ronson (Mars''s collaborator on "Uptown Funk") also performed.


      Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong. Peyton Manning completed
      an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre
      Caldwell. A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to
      the Panthers 14-yard line, but Carolina''s defense dug in over the next three
      plays. First, linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss.
      Then after an incompletion, Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain
      on third down, forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus
      34-yard field goal. The score marked the first time in the entire postseason
      that Carolina was facing a deficit.

      After each team punted, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete
      a 24-yard pass to Jerricho Cotchery, but the call was ruled an incompletion
      and upheld after a replay challenge. CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey
      stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass
      was complete. Two plays later, on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line, linebacker
      Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton''s hands while sacking him, and Malik
      Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown, giving the team
      a 10–0 lead. This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since
      Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season.


      After a punt from both teams, Carolina got on track with a 9-play, 73-yard scoring
      drive. Newton completed all four of his pass attempts for 51 yards and rushed
      twice for 25 yards, while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard
      touchdown run, cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter.
      Later on, Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman''s short 28-yard
      punt surrounded by Panthers players, but none of them attempted to make a tackle,
      apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch. Norwood had not done so,
      and with no resistance around him, he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard
      return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line. Despite
      Denver''s excellent field position, they could not get the ball into the end
      zone, so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7.


      On Carolina''s next possession, fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being
      tackled by safety Darian Stewart, which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered
      on the Broncos 40-yard line. However, the Panthers soon took the ball back when
      defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted
      it, returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left
      on the clock. The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and
      had to punt. After a Denver punt, Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line.
      But with 11 seconds left and no timeouts left, Newton was sacked by DeMarcus
      Ware causing time for the half to expire.


      The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half
      when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line
      on their second offensive play. But the Broncos defense halted the drive on
      the 26-yard line, and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights
      on a 44-yard field goal attempt. After the miss, Manning completed a pair of
      passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards, setting up McManus''
      33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead. Carolina got off to another
      strong start after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey
      Brown. But once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton
      pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J.
      Ward. Ward fumbled the ball deep in Denver territory during the return, but
      Trevathan was able to recover the ball enabling Denver to keep possession.

      There would be no more scoring in the third quarter, but early in the fourth,
      the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line. On the next play, Ealy knocked
      the ball out of Manning''s hand as he was winding up for a pass, and then recovered
      it for Carolina on the 50-yard line. A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and
      a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano''s 39-yard field goal, cutting the
      Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10. The next three drives of the game would
      end in punts.


      With 4:51 left in regulation, Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line
      with a chance to mount a game-winning drive, and soon faced 3rd-and-9. On the
      next play, Miller stripped the ball away from Newton, and after several players
      dove for it, it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward, who
      returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line. Newton was the third player
      to attempt a recovery (following Ware and Mike Remmers) of the ball and while
      various angles appeared to show that he had a decent probability of recovery
      if he''d dived in his attempt, Newton instead hesitated and then tried to drop
      on top of the ball, which failed. This split second decision later earned him
      criticism. Meanwhile, Denver''s offense was kept out of the end zone for three
      plays, but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new
      set of downs. Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed
      a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion, giving Denver a 24–10 lead
      with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away. Carolina had two more
      drives and managed one first down between them before the game ended.


      Manning finished the game 13 of 23 for 141 yards with one interception, two
      fumbles, and was sacked 5 times. Sanders was his top receiver with six receptions
      for 83 yards. Anderson was the game''s leading rusher with 90 yards and a touchdown,
      along with four receptions for 10 yards. Miller had six total tackles (five
      solo), 2½ sacks, and two forced fumbles. Ware had five total tackles and two
      sacks. Ward had seven total tackles, a fumble recovery, and an interception.
      McManus made all four of his field goals, making him perfect on all 11 attempts
      during the post-season.


      Newton completed 18 of 41 passes for 265 yards with one interception, two fumbles,
      and was sacked 6 times. He was also his team''s leading rusher with 45 yards
      on six carries. Brown caught four passes for 80 yards, while Ginn had four receptions
      for 74 yards. Ginn was sacked once on a trick play. Ealy was the top defensive
      performer for Carolina with four total tackles, three sacks, a forced fumble,
      a fumble recovery, and an interception. Defensive end Charles Johnson had four
      total tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble. Linebacker Luke Kuechly had 11 total
      tackles and a sack, while Thomas Davis had seven total tackles, despite playing
      just two weeks after breaking his right arm in the NFC title game.


      Super Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams. Denver won
      despite being massively outgained in total yards (315 to 194) and first downs
      (21 to 11). Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever
      by a Super Bowl winning team, as the previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore
      Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. Only seven other teams had ever gained fewer than
      200 yards in a Super Bowl, and all of them had lost. This was the first Super
      Bowl since Super Bowl XXXVI that the winning team scored only a single offensive
      touchdown, although the Broncos defense had earlier in the game scored a touchdown
      from a fumble recovery in the end zone. The Broncos'' seven sacks tied a Super
      Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. Manning was sacked five
      times by the Panthers, giving this game highest total (12) of combined sacks
      in Super Bowl history. Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks,
      and is the only such player to do so and record an interception. Jordan Norwood''s
      61-yard punt return set a new record, surpassing the old record of 45 yards
      set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII. Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down,
      while Carolina was 3-of-15. The two teams'' combined third down conversion percentage
      of 13.8 was the lowest in Super Bowl history. Manning and Newton had quarterback
      passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4, respectively, and their added total of 112
      is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl. Manning became
      the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39, the first quarterback
      ever to win a Super Bowl starting for two different teams, and the first quarterback
      ever to win 200 games (regular season and postseason) as a starter. Gary Kubiak
      became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went
      to the Super Bowl with as a player.


      Manning announced his retirement from the NFL a month after the Super Bowl.
      This was also the final game in the career of Panthers defensive lineman Jared
      Allen, who retired as the NFL''s ninth all-time leader in sacks.

      Super Bowl 50 had nine officials. The numbers in parentheses below indicate
      their uniform numbers.



      On September 8, 2016, the Broncos hosted the Panthers to open the 2016 NFL regular
      season. It was the first meeting of both Super Bowl participants during Week
      1 of the following season since the 1970 season when the Minnesota Vikings and
      Kansas City Chiefs held a rematch of Super Bowl IV to kick off the post-merger
      era of the NFL. The Broncos prevailed 21-20 as Carolina missed a field goal
      attempt to end the game.
