    text: "\nThe University of Notre Dame du Lac (or simply Notre Dame ) is a Catholic\
      \ research university located adjacent to South Bend, Indiana, in the United\
      \ States. In French, \"Notre Dame du Lac\" means \"Our Lady of the Lake\" and\
      \ refers to the university's patron saint, the Virgin Mary. The main campus\
      \ covers in a suburban setting and it contains a number of recognizable landmarks,\
      \ such as the Golden Dome, the \"Word of Life\" mural (commonly known as Touchdown\
      \ Jesus), and the Basilica. The school was founded on November 26, 1842, by\
      \ Father Edward Sorin, CSC, who was also its first president, as an all-male\
      \ institution on land donated by the Bishop of Vincennes (Indiana). Today, many\
      \ Holy Cross priests continue to work for the university, including the president\
      \ of the university.\n\nNotre Dame is a large, four-year, highly residential\
      \ research university. It is consistently ranked among the top twenty universities\
      \ in the United States and as a major global university and is highly regarded\
      \ for its undergraduate education. Notre Dame is also ranked as one of the top\
      \ research universities and it has one of the largest endowments in the nation\
      \ with over $10 billion. Undergraduate students are organized into four colleges\
      \ (Arts and Letters, Science, Engineering, Business), and the Architecture School.\
      \ The latter is known for teaching New Classical Architecture and for awarding\
      \ the globally renowned annual Driehaus Architecture Prize.\n\nThe university\
      \ offers over 50 foreign study abroad yearlong programs and over 15 summer programs.\
      \ Notre Dame's graduate program has more than 50 master, doctoral and professional\
      \ degree programs offered by the five schools, with the addition of the Notre\
      \ Dame Law School and a MD-PhD program offered in combination with IU medical\
      \ School. It maintains a system of libraries, cultural venues, artistic and\
      \ scientific museums, including the Hesburgh Library and the Snite Museum of\
      \ Art. The university boasts one of the largest Navy ROTC programs in the nation.\
      \ Over 80% of the university's 8,000 undergraduates live on campus in one of\
      \ 29 single-sex residence halls, each with its own traditions, legacies, events,\
      \ and intramural sports teams. The university counts approximately 120,000 alumni,\
      \ considered among the strongest alumni networks among U.S. colleges.\n\nNotre\
      \ Dame rose to national prominence in the early 1900s for its Fighting Irish\
      \ football team under the guidance of legendary coach Knute Rockne. The university's\
      \ athletic teams are members of the NCAA Division I and are known collectively\
      \ as the Fighting Irish. The football team, an Independent with no conference\
      \ affiliation, has accumulated eleven consensus national championships, seven\
      \ Heisman Trophy winners, 62 members in the College Football Hall of Fame, 13\
      \ members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and is one of the most famed and\
      \ successful college football teams in history. Other ND sport teams, chiefly\
      \ in the Atlantic Coast Conference, have accumulated 16 national championships.\
      \ The Notre Dame Victory March is often regarded as the most famous and recognizable\
      \ collegiate fight song.\n\nStarted as a small all-male institution in 1842\
      \ and charter in 1844, Notre Dame reached international fame at the beginning\
      \ of the 20th century. Major improvements to the university occurred during\
      \ the administration of the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh between 1952 and 1987 as\
      \ Hesburgh's administration greatly increased the university's resources, academic\
      \ programs, and reputation and first enrolled women undergraduates in 1972.\
      \ Ever since, the University has seen steady growth, and under the leadership\
      \ of the next two presidents, Rev. Malloy and Rev. Jenkins, many infrastructure\
      \ and research expansions have been completed.\n\nIn 1842, the Bishop of Vincennes,\
      \ Célestine Guynemer de la Hailandière, offered land to Father Edward Sorin\
      \ of the Congregation of Holy Cross, on the condition that he build a college\
      \ in two years. Fr. Sorin arrived on the site with eight Holy Cross brothers\
      \ from France and Ireland on November 26, 1842, and began the school using Father\
      \ Stephen Badin's old log chapel. He soon erected additional buildings, including\
      \ the Old College, the first church, and the first main building. They immediately\
      \ acquired two students and set about building additions to the campus.\n\n\
      Notre Dame began as a primary and secondary school, but soon received its official\
      \ college charter from the Indiana General Assembly on January 15, 1844. Under\
      \ the charter the school is officially named the University of Notre Dame du\
      \ Lac (University of Our Lady of the Lake). Because the university was originally\
      \ only for male students, the female-only Saint Mary's College was founded by\
      \ the Sisters of the Holy Cross near Notre Dame in 1844.\n\nThe first degrees\
      \ from the college were awarded in 1849. The university was expanded with new\
      \ buildings to accommodate more students and faculty. With each new president,\
      \ new academic programs were offered and new buildings built to accommodate\
      \ them. The original Main Building built by Fr. Sorin just after he arrived\
      \ was replaced by a larger \"Main Building\" in 1865, which housed the university's\
      \ administration, classrooms, and dormitories. Beginning in 1873, a library\
      \ collection was started by Father Lemonnier, housed in the Main Building, and\
      \ by 1879 it had grown to ten thousand volumes. \n\nThis Main Building, and\
      \ the library collection, was entirely destroyed by a fire in April 1879; school\
      \ closed immediately and students were sent home. The university founder, Fr.\
      \ Sorin, and the president at the time, the Rev. William Corby, immediately\
      \ planned for the rebuilding of the structure that had housed virtually the\
      \ entire University. Construction was started on May 17, and by the incredible\
      \ zeal of administrator and workers the building was completed before the fall\
      \ semester of 1879. The library collection was also rebuilt and stayed housed\
      \ in the new Main Building for years afterwards. Around the time of the fire,\
      \ a music hall was opened. Known as Washington Hall, it hosted plays and musical\
      \ acts put on by the school. By 1880, a science program was established at the\
      \ university, and a Science Hall (today LaFortune Student Center) was built\
      \ in 1883. The hall housed multiple classrooms and science labs needed for early\
      \ research at the university.\n\nBy 1890, individual residence halls were built\
      \ to house the increasing number of students.\nWilliam J. Hoynes was dean of\
      \ the law school 1883–1919, and when its new building was opened shortly after\
      \ his death it was renamed in his honor. The Rev. John Zahm C.S.C. became the\
      \ Holy Cross Provincial for the United States (1896–1906), with overall supervision\
      \ of the university. He tried to modernize and expand Notre Dame, erecting buildings\
      \ and adding to the campus art gallery and library, and amassing what became\
      \ a famous Dante collection. His term was not renewed by the Congregation because\
      \ of fears he had expanded Notre Dame too quickly and had run the Holy Cross\
      \ order into serious debt.\n\nIn 1919 Father James Burns became president of\
      \ Notre Dame, and in three years he produced an academic revolution that brought\
      \ the school up to national standards by adopting the elective system and moving\
      \ away from the university's traditional scholastic and classical emphasis.\
      \ By contrast, the Jesuit colleges, bastions of academic conservatism, were\
      \ reluctant to move to a system of electives; for this reason, their graduates\
      \ were shut out of Harvard Law School. Notre Dame continued to grow over the\
      \ years, adding more colleges, programs, and sports teams. By 1921, with the\
      \ addition of the College of Commerce, Notre Dame had grown from a small college\
      \ to a university with five colleges and a professional law school. The university\
      \ continued to expand and add new residence halls and buildings with each subsequent\
      \ president.\n\nOne of the main driving forces in the growth of the University\
      \ was its football team, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Knute Rockne became\
      \ head coach in 1918. Under Rockne, the Irish would post a record of 105 wins,\
      \ 12 losses, and five ties. During his 13 years the Irish won three national\
      \ championships, had five undefeated seasons, won the Rose Bowl in 1925, and\
      \ produced players such as George Gipp and the \"Four Horsemen\". Knute Rockne\
      \ has the highest winning percentage (.881) in NCAA Division I/FBS football\
      \ history. Rockne's offenses employed the Notre Dame Box and his defenses ran\
      \ a 7–2–2 scheme. The last game Rockne coached was on December 14, 1930, when\
      \ he led a group of Notre Dame all-stars against the New York Giants in New\
      \ York City.\n\nThe success of its football team made Notre Dame a household\
      \ name. The success of Notre Dame reflected rising status of Irish Americans\
      \ and Catholics in the 1920s. Catholics rallied up around the team and listened\
      \ to the games on the radio, especially when it knocked off the schools that\
      \ symbolized the Protestant establishment in America—Harvard, Yale, Princeton,\
      \ and Army. Yet this role as high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism\
      \ made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism. The most remarkable episode of\
      \ violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan, a\
      \ white supremacist and anti-catholic movement, in 1924. Nativism and anti-Catholicism,\
      \ especially when directed towards immigrants, were cornerstones of the KKK's\
      \ rhetoric, and Notre Dame was seen as a symbol of the threat posed by the Catholic\
      \ Church. The Klan decided to have a week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes\
      \ with the student body started on March 17, when students, aware of the anti-Catholic\
      \ animosity, blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South\
      \ Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia. On May 19 thousands of\
      \ students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college\
      \ president Fr. Matthew Walsh prevented any further clashes. The next day, football\
      \ coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey\
      \ the college president and refrain from further violence. A few days later\
      \ the Klavern broke up, but the hostility shown by the students was an omen\
      \ and a contribution to the downfall of the KKK in Indiana.\nHoly Cross Father\
      \ John Francis O'Hara was elected vice president in 1933 and president of Notre\
      \ Dame in 1934. During his tenure at Notre Dame, he brought numerous refugee\
      \ intellectuals to campus; he selected Frank H. Spearman, Jeremiah D. M. Ford,\
      \ Irvin Abell, and Josephine Brownson for the Laetare Medal, instituted in 1883.\
      \ O'Hara strongly believed that the Fighting Irish football team could be an\
      \ effective means to \"acquaint the public with the ideals that dominate\" Notre\
      \ Dame. He wrote, \"Notre Dame football is a spiritual service because it is\
      \ played for the honor and glory of God and of his Blessed Mother. When St.\
      \ Paul said: 'Whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all for\
      \ the glory of God,' he included football.\"\n\nThe Rev. John J. Cavanaugh,\
      \ C.S.C. served as president from 1946 to 1952. Cavanaugh's legacy at Notre\
      \ Dame in the post-war years was devoted to raising academic standards and reshaping\
      \ the university administration to suit it to an enlarged educational mission\
      \ and an expanded student body and stressing advanced studies and research at\
      \ a time when Notre Dame quadrupled in student census, undergraduate enrollment\
      \ increased by more than half, and graduate student enrollment grew fivefold.\
      \ Cavanaugh also established the Lobund Institute for Animal Studies and Notre\
      \ Dame's Medieval Institute. Cavanaugh also presided over the construction of\
      \ the Nieuwland Science Hall, Fisher Hall, and the Morris Inn, as well as the\
      \ Hall of Liberal Arts (now O'Shaughnessy Hall), made possible by a donation\
      \ from I.A. O'Shaughnessy, at the time the largest ever made to an American\
      \ Catholic university. He also established a system of advisory councils at\
      \ the university, which continue today and are vital to the university's governance\
      \ and development.\n\nThe Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, C.S.C., (1917–2015) served\
      \ as president for 35 years (1952–87) of dramatic transformations. In that time\
      \ the annual operating budget rose by a factor of 18 from $9.7 million to $176.6\
      \ million, and the endowment by a factor of 40 from $9 million to $350 million,\
      \ and research funding by a factor of 20 from $735,000 to $15 million. Enrollment\
      \ nearly doubled from 4,979 to 9,600, faculty more than doubled 389 to 950,\
      \ and degrees awarded annually doubled from 1,212 to 2,500.\n\nHesburgh is also\
      \ credited with transforming the face of Notre Dame by making it a coeducational\
      \ institution. In the mid-1960s Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College developed\
      \ a co-exchange program whereby several hundred students took classes not offered\
      \ at their home institution, an arrangement that added undergraduate women to\
      \ a campus that already had a few women in the graduate schools. After extensive\
      \ debate, merging with St. Mary's was rejected, primarily because of the differential\
      \ in faculty qualifications and pay scales. \"In American college education,\"\
      \ explained the Rev. Charles E. Sheedy, C.S.C., Notre Dame's Dean of Arts and\
      \ Letters, \"certain features formerly considered advantageous and enviable\
      \ are now seen as anachronistic and out of place... In this environment of diversity,\
      \ the integration of the sexes is a normal and expected aspect, replacing separatism.\"\
      \ Thomas Blantz, C.S.C., Notre Dame's Vice President of Student Affairs, added\
      \ that coeducation \"opened up a whole other pool of very bright students.\"\
      \ Two of the male residence halls were converted for the newly admitted female\
      \ students that first year, while two others were converted for the next school\
      \ year. In 1971 Mary Ann Proctor became the first female undergraduate; she\
      \ transferred from St. Mary's College. In 1972, Angela Sienko, who earned a\
      \ bachelor's degree in marketing, became the first woman graduate from the university.\n\
      \nIn the 18 years under the presidency of Edward Malloy, C.S.C., (1987–2005),\
      \ there was a rapid growth in the school's reputation, faculty, and resources.\
      \ He increased the faculty by more than 500 professors; the academic quality\
      \ of the student body has improved dramatically, with the average SAT score\
      \ rising from 1240 to 1360; the number of minority students more than doubled;\
      \ the endowment grew from $350 million to more than $3 billion; the annual operating\
      \ budget rose from $177 million to more than $650 million; and annual research\
      \ funding improved from $15 million to more than $70 million. Notre Dame's most\
      \ recent (2014) capital campaign raised $2.014 billion, far exceeding its goal\
      \ of $767 million, and is the largest in the history of Catholic higher education\
      \ and the largest of any University without a medical school.\n\nSince 2005,\
      \ Notre Dame has been led by John I. Jenkins, C.S.C., the 17th president of\
      \ the university. Jenkins took over the position from Malloy on July 1, 2005.\
      \ In his inaugural address, Jenkins described his goals of making the university\
      \ a leader in research that recognizes ethics and building the connection between\
      \ faith and studies. During his tenure, Notre Dame has increased its endowment,\
      \ enlarged its student body, and undergone many construction projects on campus,\
      \ including Compton Family Ice Arena, a new architecture hall, additional residence\
      \ halls, and the Campus Crossroads, a $400m enhancement and expansion of Notre\
      \ Dame Stadium.\n\nNotre Dame's campus is located in Notre Dame, Indiana, an\
      \ unincorporated community in the Michiana area of Northern Indiana, north of\
      \ South Bend and four miles (6 km) from the Michigan state line.\nIn September\
      \ 2011, \"Travel+Leisure\" listed Notre Dame as having one of the most beautiful\
      \ college campuses in the United States. Today it lies on just south of the\
      \ Indiana Toll Road and includes 143 buildings located on quads throughout the\
      \ campus.\n\nDevelopment of the campus began in the spring of 1843, when Fr.\
      \ Sorin and some of his congregation built the \"Old College,\" a building used\
      \ for dormitories, a bakery, and a classroom. A year later, after an architect\
      \ arrived, a small \"Main Building\" was built allowing for the launch of the\
      \ college. The Main Building burned down in 1879, and it was immediately replaced\
      \ with the current one. It was topped with the Golden Dome, which today has\
      \ become Notre Dame's most distinguishable feature. Close to the Main Building\
      \ stands Washington Hall (University of Notre Dame), a theater that was built\
      \ in 1881 and has since then been used for theatrical and musical representation.\n\
      Because of its Catholic identity, a number of religious buildings stand on campus.\
      \ The Old College building has become one of two seminaries on campus run by\
      \ the Congregation of Holy Cross. The current Basilica of the Sacred Heart is\
      \ located on the spot of Fr. Sorin's original church, which became too small\
      \ for the growing college. It is built in French Revival style and it is decorated\
      \ by stained glass windows imported directly from France. The interior was painted\
      \ by Luigi Gregori, an Italian painter invited by Fr. Sorin to be artist in\
      \ residence. The Basilica also features a bell tower with a carillon. Inside\
      \ the church there are also sculptures by Ivan Mestrovic. The Grotto of Our\
      \ Lady of Lourdes, which was built in 1896, is a replica of the original in\
      \ Lourdes, France. It is very popular among students and alumni as a place of\
      \ prayer and meditation, and it is considered one of the most beloved spots\
      \ on campus.\n\nA Science Hall was built in 1883 under the direction of Fr.\
      \ Zahm, but in 1950 it was converted to a student union building and named LaFortune\
      \ Center, after Joseph LaFortune, an oil executive from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Commonly\
      \ known as \"LaFortune\" or \"LaFun,\" it is a 4-story building of that provides\
      \ the Notre Dame community with a meeting place for social, recreational, cultural,\
      \ and educational activities. LaFortune employs 35 part-time student staff and\
      \ 29 full-time non-student staff and has an annual budget of $1.2 million.\n\
      Many businesses, services, and divisions of The Office of Student Affairs are\
      \ found within. The building also houses restaurants from national restaurant\
      \ chains.\nSince the construction of its oldest buildings, the university's\
      \ physical plant has grown substantially. Over the years 29 residence halls\
      \ have been built to accommodate students and each has been constructed with\
      \ its own chapel. Many academic building were added together with a system of\
      \ libraries, the most prominent of which is the Theodore Hesburgh Library, built\
      \ in 1963 and today containing almost 4 million books. Since 2004, several buildings\
      \ have been added, including the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the Guglielmino\
      \ Complex, and the Jordan Hall of Science. Additionally, a new residence for\
      \ men, Duncan Hall, was begun on March 8, 2007, and began accepting residents\
      \ for the Fall 2008 semester. Ryan Hall was completed and began housing undergraduate\
      \ women in the fall of 2009. A new engineering building, Stinson-Remick Hall,\
      \ a new combination Center for Social Concerns/Institute for Church Life building,\
      \ Geddes Hall, and a law school addition have recently been completed as well.\
      \ Additionally the new hockey arena opened in the fall of 2011. The Stayer Center\
      \ for Executive Education, which houses the Mendoza College of Business Executive\
      \ Education Department opened in March 2013 just South of the Mendoza College\
      \ of Business building. Because of its long athletic tradition, the university\
      \ features also many building dedicated to sport. The most famous is Notre Dame\
      \ Stadium, home of the Fighting Irish football team; it has been renovated several\
      \ times and today it can hold more than 80 thousand people. Prominent venues\
      \ include also the Edmund P. Joyce Center, with indoor basketball and volleyball\
      \ courts, and the Compton Family Ice Arena, a two-rink facility dedicated to\
      \ hockey. Also, there are many outdoor fields, as the Frank Eck Stadium for\
      \ baseball.\nLegends of Notre Dame (commonly referred to as Legends) is a music\
      \ venue, public house, and restaurant located on the campus of the University\
      \ of Notre Dame, just south of Notre Dame Stadium. The former Alumni Senior\
      \ Club opened its doors the first weekend in September 2003 after a $3.5 million\
      \ renovation and transformed into the all-ages student hang-out that currently\
      \ exists. Legends is made up of two parts: The Restaurant and Alehouse and the\
      \ nightclub.\n\nThe University of Notre Dame has made being a sustainability\
      \ leader an integral part of its mission, creating the Office of Sustainability\
      \ in 2008 to achieve a number of goals in the areas of power generation, design\
      \ and construction, waste reduction, procurement, food services, transportation,\
      \ and water.<ref name=\"About the Office//Office of Sustainability//University\

      \ International Peace Studies. Father Gustavo Gutierrez, the founder of Liberation\
      \ Theology is a current faculty member.\n\nThe university owns several centers\
      \ around the world used for international studies and research, conferences\
      \ abroad, and alumni support.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the five Global Getaways,\
      \ the University also holds a presence in Chicago where it owns the Santa Fe\
      \ Building (Chicago).\n\nThe university of Notre Dame is under the leadership\
      \ of the president, who is a priest of the Congregation of Holy Cross. The first\
      \ president was Fr. Edward Sorin and the current president is Fr. John I. Jenkins.\
      \ As of 2016, the provost of the university, who oversees academic functions,\
      \ is Thomas Burish.\nUntil 1967 Notre Dame had been governed directly by the\
      \ Congregation, but under the presidency of the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh two groups,\
      \ the Board of Fellows and the Board of Trustees were established to govern\
      \ the University. The Fellows are a group of six Holy Cross religious and six\
      \ lay members who have final say over the operation of the university. The Fellows\
      \ vote on potential trustees and sign off on all major decisions by that body.\
      \ The Trustees elect the president and provide general guidance and governance\
      \ to the university.\n\nNotre Dame's financial endowment was started in the\
      \ early 1920s by university president James Burns, and increased to US$7 million\
      \ by 1952 when Hesburgh became president. By the 1980s it reached $150 million,\
      \ and in 2000, it returned a record 57.9% investment. For the 2007 fiscal year,\
      \ the endowment had grown to approximately $6.5 billion, putting the university\
      \ in the top-15 largest endowments in the country. As of September 2015, Notre\
      \ Dame's endowment was valued over $10 billion.\n\nAs of fall 2014, Notre Dame\
      \ had 12,292 students and employed 1,126 full-time faculty members and another\
      \ 190 part-time members to give a student/faculty ratio of 8:1.\n\n\nAll of\
      \ Notre Dame's undergraduate students are a part of one of the five undergraduate\
      \ colleges at the school or are in the \"First Year of Studies program\".\n\
      The First Year of Studies program was established in 1962 to guide incoming\
      \ freshmen in their first year at the school before they have declared a major.\
      \ Each student is given an academic advisor from the program who helps them\
      \ to choose classes that give them exposure to any major in which they are interested.\
      \ The program also includes a Learning Resource Center which provides time management,\
      \ collaborative learning, and subject tutoring. This program has been recognized\
      \ previously, by \"U.S. News & World Report\", as outstanding. The program is\
      \ designed to encourage intellectual and academic achievement and innovation\
      \ among first year students. It includes programs such as FY advising, the Dean's\
      \ A list, the Renaissance circle, NDignite, the First year Urban challenge and\
      \ more.\n\nEach admissions cycle, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions selects\
      \ a small number of students for the Glynn Family Honors Program, which grants\
      \ top students within the College of Arts and Letters and the College of Science\
      \ access to smaller class sizes taught by distinguished faculty, endowed funding\
      \ for independent research, and dedicated advising faculty and staff.\n\nThe\
      \ university first offered graduate degrees, in the form of a Master of Arts\
      \ (MA), in the 1854–1855 academic year. The program expanded to include Master\
      \ of Laws (LL.M.) and Master of Civil Engineering in its early stages of growth,\
      \ before a formal graduate school education was developed with a thesis not\
      \ required to receive the degrees. This changed in 1924 with formal requirements\
      \ developed for graduate degrees, including offering Doctorate (PhD) degrees.\n\
      \nIn 2014, Notre Dame announced plans to establish the \"Donald R. Keough School\
      \ of Global Affairs\", a professional school focused on the study of global\
      \ government, human rights, and other areas of global social and political policy.\
      \ The creation of the school is funded by a $50 million gift from Donald Keough\
      \ and Marilyn Keough and will be housed in Jenkins Hall on Debartolo Quad. The\
      \ school is scheduled to open in August 2017.\n\nThe library system of the university\
      \ is divided between the main library and each of the colleges and schools.\
      \ The main building is the 14-story Theodore M. Hesburgh Library, completed\
      \ in 1963, which is the third building to house the main collection of books.\
      \ The front of the library is adorned with the Word of Life mural designed by\
      \ artist Millard Sheets. This mural is popularly known as \"Touchdown Jesus\"\
      \ because of its proximity to Notre Dame Stadium and Jesus' arms appearing to\
      \ make the signal for a touchdown.\n\nThe library system also includes branch\
      \ libraries for Architecture, Chemistry and Physics, Engineering, Law, and Mathematics\
      \ as well as information centers in the Mendoza College of Business, the Kellogg\
      \ Institute for International Studies, the Joan B. Kroc Institute for International\
      \ Peace Studies, and a slide library in O'Shaughnessy Hall. A theology library\
      \ was also opened in fall of 2015. Located on the first floor of Stanford Hall,\
      \ it is the first branch of the library system to be housed in a dorm room.\
      \ The library system holds over three million volumes, was the single largest\
      \ university library in the world upon its completion, and remains one of the\
      \ 100 largest libraries in the country.\n\nNotre Dame is known for its competitive\
      \ admissions, with the incoming class enrolling in fall 2016 admitting 3,655\
      \ from a pool of 19,505 (18.7%). The academic profile of the enrolled class\
      \ continues to rate among the top 10 to 15 in the nation for national research\
      \ universities. Of the most recent class, the Class of 2020, 48% were in the\
      \ top 1% of their high school, and 94% were in the top 10%. The median SAT score\
      \ was 1510 and the median ACt score was 34. The university practices a non-restrictive\
      \ early action policy that allows admitted students to consider admission to\
      \ Notre Dame as well as any other colleges to which they were accepted. 1,400\
      \ of the 3,577 (39.1%) were admitted under the early action plan. Admitted students\
      \ came from 1,311 high schools and the average student traveled more than 750\
      \ miles to Notre Dame, making it arguably the most representative university\
      \ in the United States. While all entering students begin in the College of\
      \ the First Year of Studies, 25% have indicated they plan to study in the liberal\
      \ arts or social sciences, 24% in engineering, 24% in business, 24% in science,\
      \ and 3% in architecture.\n\nIn 2016–2017, Notre Dame ranked 7th for undegraduate\
      \ teaching and 15th overall among \"national universities\" in the United States\
      \ in \"U.S. News & World Report\"s \"Best Colleges 2016\". In 2014, \"USA Today\"\
      \ ranked Notre Dame 10th overall for American universities. \"Forbes\"'s \"\
      America's Top Colleges\" ranks Notre Dame 13th among colleges in the United\
      \ States in 2016, 8th among Research Universities, and 1st in the Midwest. \"\
      U.S. News & World Report\" also lists Notre Dame Law School as 22nd overall.\
      \ \"BusinessWeek\" ranks Mendoza College of Business undergraduate school as\
      \ 1st overall. It ranks the MBA program as 20th overall. The Philosophical Gourmet\
      \ Report ranks Notre Dame's graduate philosophy program as 15th nationally,\
      \ while \"ARCHITECT\" Magazine ranked the undergraduate architecture program\
      \ as 12th nationally.\nAdditionally, the study abroad program ranks sixth in\
      \ highest participation percentage in the nation, with 57.6% of students choosing\
      \ to study abroad in 17 countries. According to PayScale, undergraduate alumni\
      \ of University of Notre Dame have a mid-career median salary $110,000, making\
      \ it the 24th highest among colleges and universities in the United States.\
      \ The median starting salary of $55,300 ranked 58th in the same peer group.\n\
      \nNamed by \"Newsweek\" as one of the \"25 New Ivies,\" it is also an Oak Ridge\
      \ Associated University.\n\nFather Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. was Director of the\
      \ Science Museum and the Library and Professor of Chemistry and Physics until\
      \ 1874. Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress\
      \ were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed\
      \ by the Church. One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm who\
      \ was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and\
      \ by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active\
      \ in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to\
      \ contemporary intellectual issues. His book \"Evolution and Dogma\" (1896)\
      \ defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover,\
      \ that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something\
      \ like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's\
      \ censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt\
      \ embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.\n\nIn 1882, Albert Zahm\
      \ (John Zahm's brother) built an early wind tunnel used to compare lift to drag\
      \ of aeronautical models. Around 1899, Professor Jerome Green became the first\
      \ American to send a wireless message. In 1931, Father Julius Nieuwland performed\
      \ early work on basic reactions that was used to create neoprene. Study of nuclear\
      \ physics at the university began with the building of a nuclear accelerator\
      \ in 1936, and continues now partly through a partnership in the Joint Institute\
      \ for Nuclear Astrophysics.\n\nThe Lobund Institute (Laboratory Of Biology University\
      \ of Notre Dame) grew out of pioneering research in germ-free-life which began\
      \ in 1928. This area of research originated in a question posed by Pasteur as\
      \ to whether animal life was possible without bacteria. Though others had taken\
      \ up this idea, their research was short lived and inconclusive. Lobund was\
      \ the first research organization to answer definitively, that such life is\
      \ possible and that it can be prolonged through generations. But the objective\
      \ was not merely to answer Pasteur's question but also to produce the germ free\
      \ animal as a new tool for biological and medical research. This objective was\
      \ reached and for years Lobund was a unique center for the study and production\
      \ of germ free animals and for their use in biological and medical investigations.\
      \ Today the work has spread to other universities. In the beginning it was under\
      \ the Department of Biology and a program leading to the master's degree accompanied\
      \ the research program. In the 1940s Lobund achieved independent status as a\
      \ purely research organization and in 1950 was raised to the status of an Institute.\
      \ In 1958 it was brought back into the Department of Biology as integral part\
      \ of that department, but with its own program leading to the degree of PhD\
      \ in Gnotobiotics.\nRichard T. Sullivan taught English from 1936 to 1974 and\
      \ published six novels, dozens of short stories, and various other efforts.\
      \ He was known as a regional writer and a Catholic spokesman.\n\nFrank O'Malley\
      \ was an English professor during the 1930s–1960s. Influenced by philosophers\
      \ Jacques Maritain, John U. Nef, and others, O'Malley developed a concept of\
      \ Christian philosophy that was a fundamental element in his thought. Through\
      \ his course \"Modern Catholic Writers\" O'Malley introduced generations of\
      \ undergraduates to Gabriel Marcel, Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh, Sigrid Undset,\
      \ Paul Claudel, and Gerard Manley Hopkins.\n\n\"The Review of Politics\" was\
      \ founded in 1939 by Waldemar Gurian, modeled after German Catholic journals.\
      \ It quickly emerged as part of an international Catholic intellectual revival,\
      \ offering an alternative vision to positivist philosophy. For 44 years, the\
      \ \"Review\" was edited by Gurian, Matthew Fitzsimons, Frederick Crosson, and\
      \ Thomas Stritch. Intellectual leaders included Gurian, Jacques Maritain, Frank\
      \ O'Malley, Leo Richard Ward, F. A. Hermens, and John U. Nef. It became a major\
      \ forum for political ideas and modern political concerns, especially from a\
      \ Catholic and scholastic tradition.\n\nKenneth Sayre has explored the history\
      \ of the Philosophy department. He stresses the abandonment of official Thomism\
      \ to the philosophical pluralism of the 1970s, with attention to the issue of\
      \ being Catholic. He pays special attention to the charismatic personalities\
      \ of Ernan McMullin and Ralph McInerny, key leaders of the department in the\
      \ 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe rise of Hitler and other dictators in the 1930s forced\
      \ numerous Catholic intellectuals to flee Europe; president John O'Hara brought\
      \ many to Notre Dame. From Germany came Anton-Hermann Chroust (1907–1982) in\
      \ classics and law, and Waldemar Gurian a German Catholic intellectual of Jewish\
      \ descent. Positivism dominated American intellectual life in the 1920s onward\
      \ but in marked contrast, Gurian received a German Catholic education and wrote\
      \ his doctoral dissertation under Max Scheler. Ivan Meštrović (1883–1962), a\
      \ renowned sculptor, brought Croatian culture to campus, 1955–62. Yves Simon\
      \ (1903–61), brought to ND in the 1940s the insights of French studies in the\
      \ Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition of philosophy; his own teacher Jacques Maritain\
      \ (1882–73) was a frequent visitor to campus.\n\nThe exiles developed a distinctive\
      \ emphasis on the evils of totalitarianism. For example, the political science\
      \ courses of Gerhart Niemeyer (1907–97) discussed communist ideology and were\
      \ particularly accessible to his students. He came to ND in 1955, and was a\
      \ frequent contributor to the \"National Review\" and other conservative magazines.\n\
      \n research continued in many fields. The university president, John Jenkins,\
      \ described his hope that Notre Dame would become \"one of the pre–eminent research\
      \ institutions in the world\" in his inaugural address. The university has many\
      \ multi-disciplinary institutes devoted to research in varying fields, including\
      \ the Medieval Institute, the Kellogg Institute for International Studies, the\
      \ Kroc Institute for International Peace studies, and the Center for Social\
      \ Concerns. Recent research includes work on family conflict and child development,\
      \ genome mapping, the increasing trade deficit of the United States with China,\
      \ studies in fluid mechanics, computational science and engineering, and marketing\
      \ trends on the Internet. As of 2013, the university is home to the Notre Dame\
      \ Global Adaptation Index which ranks countries annually based on how vulnerable\
      \ they are to climate change and how prepared they are to adapt.\n\nIn 2014\
      \ the Notre Dame student body consisted of 12,179 students, with 8,448 undergraduates,\
      \ 2,138 graduate and professional and 1,593 professional (Law, M.Div., Business,\
      \ M.Ed.) students. Around 21–24% of students are children of alumni, and although\
      \ 37% of students come from the Midwestern United States, the student body represents\
      \ all 50 states and 100 countries. 32% of students are U.S. students of color\
      \ or international citizens. \"The Princeton Review\" ranked the school as the\
      \ fifth highest 'dream school' for parents to send their children. The \"Princeton\
      \ Review\" ranked Notre Dame as the ninth highest. It has also been commended\
      \ by some diversity oriented publications; \"Hispanic Magazine\" in 2004 ranked\
      \ the university ninth on its list of the top–25 colleges for Latinos, and \"\
      The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education\" recognized the university in 2006\
      \ for raising enrollment of African-American students. With 6,000 participants,\
      \ the university's intramural sports program was named in 2004 by \"Sports Illustrated\"\
      \ as the best program in the country, while in 2007 \"The Princeton Review\"\
      \ named it as the top school where \"Everyone Plays Intramural Sports.\" The\
      \ annual Bookstore Basketball tournament is the largest outdoor five-on-five\
      \ tournament in the world with over 700 teams participating each year, while\
      \ the Notre Dame Men's Boxing Club hosts the annual Bengal Bouts tournament\
      \ that raises money for the Holy Cross Missions in Bangladesh.\n\nThe strictly\
      \ measured federal graduation rate for athletes was 90% for freshmen who entered\
      \ between 2005 and 2008. This is the second highest in the country.\n\nAbout\
      \ 80% of undergraduates and 20% of graduate students live on campus. The majority\
      \ of the graduate students on campus live in one of four graduate housing complexes\
      \ on campus, while all on-campus undergraduates live in one of the 31 residence\
      \ halls. Because of the religious affiliation of the university, all residence\
      \ halls are single-sex, with 16 male dorms and 15 female dorms. The university\
      \ maintains a visiting policy (known as parietal hours) for those students who\
      \ live in dormitories, specifying times when members of the opposite sex are\
      \ allowed to visit other students' dorm rooms; however, all residence halls\
      \ have 24-hour social spaces for students regardless of gender. Many residence\
      \ halls have at least one nun and/or priest as a resident. There are no traditional\
      \ social fraternities or sororities at the university, but a majority of students\
      \ live in the same residence hall for all four years. Some intramural sports\
      \ are based on residence hall teams, where the university offers the only non-military\
      \ academy program of full-contact intramural American football. At the end of\
      \ the intramural season, the championship game is played on the field in Notre\
      \ Dame Stadium.\n\nThe university is affiliated with the Congregation of Holy\
      \ Cross (Latin: \"Congregatio a Sancta Cruce\", abbreviated postnominals: \"\
      CSC\"). While religious affiliation is not a criterion for admission, more than\
      \ 93% of students identify as Christian, with over 80% of the total being Catholic.\
      \ Collectively, Catholic Mass is celebrated over 100 times per week on campus,\
      \ and a large campus ministry program provides for the faith needs of the community.\
      \ There are multitudes of religious statues and artwork around campus, most\
      \ prominent of which are the statue of Mary on the Main Building, the Notre\
      \ Dame Grotto, and the Word of Life mural on Hesburgh Library depicting Christ\
      \ as a teacher. Additionally, every classroom displays a crucifix. There are\
      \ many religious clubs (Catholic and non-Catholic) at the school, including\
      \ Council #1477 of the Knights of Columbus (KOC), Baptist Collegiate Ministry\
      \ (BCM), Jewish Club, Muslim Student Association, Orthodox Christian Fellowship,\
      \ The Mormon Club, and many more. The Notre Dame KofC are known for being the\
      \ first collegiate council of KofC, operating a charitable concession stand\
      \ during every home football game and owning their own building on campus which\
      \ can be used as a cigar lounge. Fifty-seven chapels are located throughout\
      \ the campus.\n\nArchitecturally, the school has a Catholic character. Atop\
      \ the Main Building's gold dome is a golden statue of the Virgin Mary. Immediately\
      \ in front of the Main Building and facing it, is a copper statue of Christ\
      \ with arms upraised with the legend \"\"Venite Ad Me Omnes\"\" (Come to me,\
      \ all ye). Next to the Main Building is the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Immediately\
      \ behind the basilica is the Grotto, a Marian place of prayer and reflection.\
      \ It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, France where the Virgin Mary reputedly\
      \ appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 1858. At the end of the main drive\
      \ (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and the Gold Dome),\
      \ is a simple, modern stone statue of Mary.\n\nThe university is the major seat\
      \ of the Congregation of Holy Cross (albeit not its official headquarters, which\
      \ are in Rome). Its main seminary, Moreau Seminary, is located on the campus\
      \ across St. Joseph lake from the Main Building. Old College, the oldest building\
      \ on campus and located near the shore of St. Mary lake, houses undergraduate\
      \ seminarians. Retired priests and brothers reside in Fatima House (a former\
      \ retreat center), Holy Cross House, as well as Columba Hall near the Grotto.\n\
      \nThe university has a highly regarded theology program, both undergraduate\
      \ and graduate, with many scholars, including Lawrence Cunningham, John Cavadini,\
      \ and Gary Anderson. The chair of the department, John Cavadini, was appointed\
      \ to the International Theological Commission by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010;\
      \ Prof. Brian E. Daley, SJ, received the Ratzinger Prize in Theology in 2012.\n\
      As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media\
      \ outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio\
      \ and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page\
      \ journal in September 1876, the \"Scholastic\" magazine is issued twice monthly\
      \ and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United\
      \ States. The other magazine, \"The Juggler\", is released twice a year and\
      \ focuses on student literature and artwork. The \"Dome\" yearbook is published\
      \ annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with \"The Observer\"\
      \ published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed\
      \ by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike \"Scholastic\"\
      \ and \"The Dome,\" \"The Observer\" is an independent publication and does\
      \ not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University.\
      \ In 1987, when some students believed that \"The Observer\" began to show a\
      \ conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, \"Common Sense\" was published. Likewise,\
      \ in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias,\
      \ the conservative paper \"Irish Rover\" went into production. Neither paper\
      \ is published as often as \"The Observer\"; however, all three are distributed\
      \ to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political\
      \ science research, \"Beyond Politics\", made its debut.\n\nThe television station,\
      \ NDtv, grew from one show in 2002 to a full 24-hour channel with original programming\
      \ by September 2006. WSND-FM serves the student body and larger South Bend community\
      \ at 88.9 FM, offering students a chance to become involved in bringing classical\
      \ music, fine arts and educational programming, and alternative rock to the\
      \ airwaves. Another radio station, WVFI, began as a partner of WSND-FM. More\
      \ recently, however, WVFI has been airing independently and is streamed on the\
      \ Internet.\n\nThe first phase of Eddy Street Commons, a $215 million development\
      \ located adjacent to the University of Notre Dame campus and funded by the\
      \ university, broke ground on June 3, 2008. The Eddy Street Commons drew union\
      \ protests when workers hired by the City of South Bend to construct the public\
      \ parking garage picketed the private work site after a contractor hired non-union\
      \ workers. The developer, Kite Realty out of Indianapolis, has made agreements\
      \ with major national chains rather than local businesses, a move that has led\
      \ to criticism from alumni and students.\n\nNotre Dame teams are known as the\
      \ Fighting Irish. They compete as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic\
      \ Association (NCAA) Division I, primarily competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference\
      \ (ACC) for all sports since the 2013–14 school year. The Fighting Irish previously\
      \ competed in the Horizon League from 1982–83 to 1985–86, and again from 1987–88\
      \ to 1994–95, and then in the Big East Conference through 2012–13. Men's sports\
      \ include baseball, basketball, crew, cross country, fencing, football, golf,\
      \ ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis and track & field;\
      \ while women's sports include basketball, cross country, fencing, golf, lacrosse,\
      \ rowing, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, and\
      \ volleyball. The football team competes as an Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS)\
      \ Independent since its inception in 1887. Both fencing teams compete in the\
      \ Midwest Fencing Conference, and the men's ice hockey team competes in Hockey\
      \ East.\n\nNotre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except\
      \ football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference\
      \ realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish\
      \ left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in\
      \ the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed\
      \ to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish\
      \ were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision\
      \ to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated\
      \ in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate\
      \ Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey\
      \ team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced\
      \ it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school\
      \ year.\nThere are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker\
      \ but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with\
      \ respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace\
      \ in his \"New York Daily News\" columns. The official colors of Notre Dame\
      \ are navy blue and gold which are worn in competition by its athletic teams.\
      \ In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname.\
      \ The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by\
      \ Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket\
      \ schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured\
      \ on the cover of \"Time\" in November 1964 and gained national exposure.\n\n\
      On July 1, 2014, the University of Notre Dame and Under Armour reached an agreement\
      \ in which Under Armour will provide uniforms, apparel,equipment, and monetary\
      \ compensation to Notre Dame for 10 years. This contract, worth almost $100\
      \ million, is the most lucrative in the history of the NCAA.\nThe university\
      \ marching band plays at home games for most of the sports. The band, which\
      \ began in 1846 and has a claim as the oldest university band in continuous\
      \ existence in the United States, was honored by the National Music Council\
      \ as a \"Landmark of American Music\" during the United States Bicentennial.\
      \ The band regularly plays the school's fight song the \"Notre Dame Victory\
      \ March\", which was named as the most played and most famous fight song by\
      \ Northern Illinois Professor William Studwell. According to \"College Fight\
      \ Songs: An Annotated Anthology\" published in 1998, the \"Notre Dame Victory\
      \ March\" ranks as the greatest fight song of all time.\n\nAccording to some\
      \ analysts without direct connection to the university or its athletic department,\
      \ Notre Dame promotes Muscular Christianity through its athletic programs.\n\
      \nThe Notre Dame football team has a long history, first beginning when the\
      \ Michigan Wolverines football team brought football to Notre Dame in 1887 and\
      \ played against a group of students. In the long history since then, 13 Fighting\
      \ Irish teams have won consensus national championships (although the university\
      \ only claims 11), along with another nine teams being named national champion\
      \ by at least one source. Additionally, the program has the most members in\
      \ the College Football Hall of Fame, is tied with Ohio State University with\
      \ the most Heisman Trophies won, and have the highest winning percentage in\
      \ NCAA history. With the long history, Notre Dame has accumulated many rivals,\
      \ and its annual game against USC for the Jeweled Shillelagh has been named\
      \ by some as one of the most important in college football and is often called\
      \ the greatest intersectional rivalry in college football in the country.\n\n\
      George Gipp was the school's legendary football player during 1916–20. He played\
      \ semiprofessional baseball and smoked, drank, and gambled when not playing\
      \ sports. He was also humble, generous to the needy, and a man of integrity.\
      \ It was in 1928 that famed coach Knute Rockne used his final conversation with\
      \ the dying Gipp to inspire the Notre Dame team to beat the Army team and \"\
      win one for the Gipper.\" The 1940 film, \"Knute Rockne, All American\", starred\
      \ Pat O'Brien as Knute Rockne and Ronald Reagan as Gipp.\nThe team competes\
      \ in Notre Dame Stadium, an 80,795-seat stadium on campus. The current head\
      \ coach is Brian Kelly, hired from the University of Cincinnati on December\
      \ 11, 2009. Kelly's record in midway through his sixth season at Notre Dame\
      \ is 52–21. In 2012, Kelly's Fighting Irish squad went undefeated and played\
      \ in the BCS National Championship Game. Kelly succeeded Charlie Weis, who was\
      \ fired in November 2009 after five seasons. Although Weis led his team to two\
      \ Bowl Championship Series bowl games, his overall record was 35–27, mediocre\
      \ by Notre Dame standards, and the 2007 team had the most losses in school history.\
      \ The football team generates enough revenue to operate independently while\
      \ $22.1 million is retained from the team's profits for academic use. \"Forbes\"\
      \ named the team as the most valuable in college football, worth a total of\
      \ $101 million in 2007.\nFootball gameday traditions\nDuring home games, activities\
      \ occur all around campus and different dorms decorate their halls with a traditional\
      \ item (e.g., Zahm Hall's two-story banner). Traditional activities begin at\
      \ the stroke of midnight with the Drummers' Circle. This tradition involves\
      \ the drum line of the Band of the Fighting Irish and ushers in the rest of\
      \ the festivities that will continue the rest of the gameday Saturday. Later\
      \ that day, the trumpet section will play the Notre Dame Victory March and the\
      \ Notre Dame Alma Mater under the dome. The entire band will play a concert\
      \ at the steps of Bond Hall, from where they will march into Notre Dame Stadium,\
      \ leading fans and students alike across the campus to the game.\n\nAs of the\
      \ 2014–2015 season, the men's basketball team has over 1,898 wins, one of only\
      \ 8 schools with more wins, and have appeared in 28 NCAA tournaments. Former\
      \ player Austin Carr holds the record for most points scored in a single game\
      \ of the tournament with 61. Although the team has never won the NCAA Tournament,\
      \ they were named by the Helms Athletic Foundation as national champions twice.\
      \ The team has orchestrated a number of upsets of number one ranked teams, the\
      \ most notable of which was ending UCLA's record 88-game winning streak in 1974.\
      \ The team has beaten an additional eight number-one teams, and those nine wins\
      \ rank second, to UCLA's 10, all-time in wins against the top team. The team\
      \ plays in newly renovated Purcell Pavilion (within the Edmund P. Joyce Center),\
      \ which reopened for the beginning of the 2009–2010 season. The team is coached\
      \ by Mike Brey, who, as of the 2015–16 season, his fifteenth at Notre Dame,\
      \ has achieved a 356–177 record. In 2009 they were invited to the NIT, where\
      \ they advanced to the semifinals but were beaten by Penn State who went on\
      \ and beat Baylor in the championship. The 2010–11 team concluded its regular\
      \ season ranked number seven in the country, with a record of 25–5, Brey's fifth\
      \ straight 20-win season, and a second-place finish in the Big East. During\
      \ the 2014–15 season, the team went 32–6 and won the ACC conference tournament,\
      \ later advancing to the Elite 8, where the Fighting Irish lost on a missed\
      \ buzzer-beater against then undefeated Kentucky. Led by NBA draft picks Jerian\
      \ Grant and Pat Connaughton, the Fighting Irish beat the eventual national champion\
      \ Duke Blue Devils twice during the season. The 32 wins were the most by the\
      \ Fighting Irish team since 1908–09.\n\nNotre Dame has been successful in other\
      \ sports besides football, with an additional 14 national championships in various\
      \ sports. Three teams have won multiple national championships with the fencing\
      \ team leading them with seven, followed by the men's tennis and women's soccer\
      \ teams each with two. The men's cross country, men's golf, and women's basketball\
      \ teams have each won one in their histories.\n\nIn the first ten years that\
      \ Notre Dame competed in the Big East Conference its teams won a total of 64\
      \ championships. As of 2010, the women's swimming and diving team holds the\
      \ Big East record for consecutive conference championships in any sport with\
      \ 14 straight conference titles (1997–2010).\n\nThe Band of the Fighting Irish\
      \ is the oldest university band in continuous existence. It was formed in 1846.\
      \ The all-male Glee Club was formed in 1915. The Internationally recognized\
      \ \"Notre Dame Folk Choir\" was founded by Steven \"Cookie\" Warner in 1980.\n\
      \nThe \"Notre Dame Victory March\" is the fight song for the University of Notre\
      \ Dame. It was written by two brothers who were Notre Dame graduates. The Rev.\
      \ Michael J. Shea, a 1904 graduate, wrote the music, and his brother, John F.\
      \ Shea, who earned degrees in 1906 and 1908, wrote the original lyrics. The\
      \ lyrics were revised in the 1920s; it first appeared under the copyright of\
      \ the University of Notre Dame in 1928. The chorus is, \"Cheer cheer for old\
      \ Notre Dame, wake up the echos cheering her name. Send a volley cheer on high,\
      \ shake down the thunder from the sky! What though the odds be great or small,\
      \ old Notre Dame will win over all. While her loyal sons are marching, onward\
      \ to victory!\"\n\nThe chorus of the song is one of the most recognizable collegiate\
      \ fight songs in the United States, and was ranked first among fight songs by\
      \ Northern Illinois University Professor William Studwell, who remarked it was\
      \ \"more borrowed, more famous and, frankly, you just hear it more\".\n\nIn\
      \ the film \"Knute Rockne, All American\", Knute Rockne (played by Pat O'Brien)\
      \ delivers the famous \"Win one for the Gipper\" speech, at which point the\
      \ background music swells with the \"Notre Dame Victory March\". George Gipp\
      \ was played by Ronald Reagan, whose nickname \"The Gipper\" was derived from\
      \ this role. This scene was parodied in the movie \"Airplane!\" with the same\
      \ background music, only this time honoring George Zipp, one of Ted Striker's\
      \ former comrades. The song also was prominent in the movie \"Rudy\", with Sean\
      \ Astin as Daniel \"Rudy\" Ruettiger, who harbored dreams of playing football\
      \ at the University of Notre Dame despite significant obstacles.\n\nNotre Dame\
      \ alumni number near 120,000, and are members of 275 alumni clubs around the\
      \ world. Many alumni give yearly monetary support to the university, with a\
      \ school-record 53.2% giving some donation in 2006. Many buildings on campus\
      \ are named for those whose donations allowed their building, including residence\
      \ halls, classroom buildings, and the performing arts center.\n\nNotre Dame\
      \ alumni work in various fields. Alumni working in political fields include\
      \ state governors, members of the United States Congress, and former United\
      \ States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Notable alumni from the College\
      \ of Science are Eric F. Wieschaus, winner of the 1995 Nobel Prize in medicine,\
      \ and Philip Majerus, discoverer of the cardioprotective effects of aspirin.\
      \ A number of university heads are alumni, including Notre Dame's current president,\
      \ the Rev. John Jenkins. Additionally, many alumni are in the media, including\
      \ talk show hosts Regis Philbin and Phil Donahue, and television and radio personalities\
      \ such as Mike Golic and Hannah Storm. With the university having high-profile\
      \ sports teams itself, a number of alumni went on to become involved in athletics\
      \ outside the university, including professional baseball, basketball, football,\
      \ and ice hockey players, such as Joe Theismann, Joe Montana, Tim Brown, Ross\
      \ Browner, Rocket Ismail, Ruth Riley, Jeff Samardzija, Jerome Bettis, Brett\
      \ Lebda, Olympic gold medalist Mariel Zagunis, professional boxer Mike Lee,\
      \ former football coaches such as Charlie Weis, Frank Leahy and Knute Rockne,\
      \ and Basketball Hall of Famers Austin Carr and Adrian Dantley. Other notable\
      \ alumni include prominent businessman Edward J. DeBartolo, Jr. and astronaut\
      \ Jim Wetherbee.\n\nThe University of Notre Dame is the setting for numerous\
      \ works of fiction, as well of the alma mater of many fictitious characters.\n\
      \nFilm\n\nTelevision\n\nOther media\n\n\n\nArchitecturally, the school has a\
      \ Catholic character. Atop the Main Building's gold dome is a golden statue\
      \ of the Virgin Mary. Immediately in front of the Main Building and facing it,\
      \ is a copper statue of Christ with arms upraised with the legend \"Venite Ad\
      \ Me Omnes\". Next to the Main Building is the Basilica of the Sacred Heart.\
      \ Immediately behind the basilica is the Grotto, a Marian place of prayer and\
      \ reflection. It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, France where the Virgin\
      \ Mary reputedly appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 1858. At the end\
      \ of the main drive (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and\

    text: "\nThe University of Notre Dame du Lac (or simply Notre Dame ) is a Catholic\
      \ research university located adjacent to South Bend, Indiana, in the United\
      \ States. In French, \"Notre Dame du Lac\" means \"Our Lady of the Lake\" and\
      \ refers to the university's patron saint, the Virgin Mary. The main campus\
      \ covers in a suburban setting and it contains a number of recognizable landmarks,\
      \ such as the Golden Dome, the \"Word of Life\" mural (commonly known as Touchdown\
      \ Jesus), and the Basilica. The school was founded on November 26, 1842, by\
      \ Father Edward Sorin, CSC, who was also its first president, as an all-male\
      \ institution on land donated by the Bishop of Vincennes (Indiana). Today, many\
      \ Holy Cross priests continue to work for the university, including the president\
      \ of the university.\n\nNotre Dame is a large, four-year, highly residential\
      \ research university. It is consistently ranked among the top twenty universities\
      \ in the United States and as a major global university and is highly regarded\
      \ for its undergraduate education. Notre Dame is also ranked as one of the top\
      \ research universities and it has one of the largest endowments in the nation\
      \ with over $10 billion. Undergraduate students are organized into four colleges\
      \ (Arts and Letters, Science, Engineering, Business), and the Architecture School.\
      \ The latter is known for teaching New Classical Architecture and for awarding\
      \ the globally renowned annual Driehaus Architecture Prize.\n\nThe university\
      \ offers over 50 foreign study abroad yearlong programs and over 15 summer programs.\
      \ Notre Dame's graduate program has more than 50 master, doctoral and professional\
      \ degree programs offered by the five schools, with the addition of the Notre\
      \ Dame Law School and a MD-PhD program offered in combination with IU medical\
      \ School. It maintains a system of libraries, cultural venues, artistic and\
      \ scientific museums, including the Hesburgh Library and the Snite Museum of\
      \ Art. The university boasts one of the largest Navy ROTC programs in the nation.\
      \ Over 80% of the university's 8,000 undergraduates live on campus in one of\
      \ 29 single-sex residence halls, each with its own traditions, legacies, events,\
      \ and intramural sports teams. The university counts approximately 120,000 alumni,\
      \ considered among the strongest alumni networks among U.S. colleges.\n\nNotre\
      \ Dame rose to national prominence in the early 1900s for its Fighting Irish\
      \ football team under the guidance of legendary coach Knute Rockne. The university's\
      \ athletic teams are members of the NCAA Division I and are known collectively\
      \ as the Fighting Irish. The football team, an Independent with no conference\
      \ affiliation, has accumulated eleven consensus national championships, seven\
      \ Heisman Trophy winners, 62 members in the College Football Hall of Fame, 13\
      \ members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and is one of the most famed and\
      \ successful college football teams in history. Other ND sport teams, chiefly\
      \ in the Atlantic Coast Conference, have accumulated 16 national championships.\
      \ The Notre Dame Victory March is often regarded as the most famous and recognizable\
      \ collegiate fight song.\n\nStarted as a small all-male institution in 1842\
      \ and charter in 1844, Notre Dame reached international fame at the beginning\
      \ of the 20th century. Major improvements to the university occurred during\
      \ the administration of the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh between 1952 and 1987 as\
      \ Hesburgh's administration greatly increased the university's resources, academic\
      \ programs, and reputation and first enrolled women undergraduates in 1972.\
      \ Ever since, the University has seen steady growth, and under the leadership\
      \ of the next two presidents, Rev. Malloy and Rev. Jenkins, many infrastructure\
      \ and research expansions have been completed.\n\nIn 1842, the Bishop of Vincennes,\
      \ Célestine Guynemer de la Hailandière, offered land to Father Edward Sorin\
      \ of the Congregation of Holy Cross, on the condition that he build a college\
      \ in two years. Fr. Sorin arrived on the site with eight Holy Cross brothers\
      \ from France and Ireland on November 26, 1842, and began the school using Father\
      \ Stephen Badin's old log chapel. He soon erected additional buildings, including\
      \ the Old College, the first church, and the first main building. They immediately\
      \ acquired two students and set about building additions to the campus.\n\n\
      Notre Dame began as a primary and secondary school, but soon received its official\
      \ college charter from the Indiana General Assembly on January 15, 1844. Under\
      \ the charter the school is officially named the University of Notre Dame du\
      \ Lac (University of Our Lady of the Lake). Because the university was originally\
      \ only for male students, the female-only Saint Mary's College was founded by\
      \ the Sisters of the Holy Cross near Notre Dame in 1844.\n\nThe first degrees\
      \ from the college were awarded in 1849. The university was expanded with new\
      \ buildings to accommodate more students and faculty. With each new president,\
      \ new academic programs were offered and new buildings built to accommodate\
      \ them. The original Main Building built by Fr. Sorin just after he arrived\
      \ was replaced by a larger \"Main Building\" in 1865, which housed the university's\
      \ administration, classrooms, and dormitories. Beginning in 1873, a library\
      \ collection was started by Father Lemonnier, housed in the Main Building, and\
      \ by 1879 it had grown to ten thousand volumes. \n\nThis Main Building, and\
      \ the library collection, was entirely destroyed by a fire in April 1879; school\
      \ closed immediately and students were sent home. The university founder, Fr.\
      \ Sorin, and the president at the time, the Rev. William Corby, immediately\
      \ planned for the rebuilding of the structure that had housed virtually the\
      \ entire University. Construction was started on May 17, and by the incredible\
      \ zeal of administrator and workers the building was completed before the fall\
      \ semester of 1879. The library collection was also rebuilt and stayed housed\
      \ in the new Main Building for years afterwards. Around the time of the fire,\
      \ a music hall was opened. Known as Washington Hall, it hosted plays and musical\
      \ acts put on by the school. By 1880, a science program was established at the\
      \ university, and a Science Hall (today LaFortune Student Center) was built\
      \ in 1883. The hall housed multiple classrooms and science labs needed for early\
      \ research at the university.\n\nBy 1890, individual residence halls were built\
      \ to house the increasing number of students.\nWilliam J. Hoynes was dean of\
      \ the law school 1883–1919, and when its new building was opened shortly after\
      \ his death it was renamed in his honor. The Rev. John Zahm C.S.C. became the\
      \ Holy Cross Provincial for the United States (1896–1906), with overall supervision\
      \ of the university. He tried to modernize and expand Notre Dame, erecting buildings\
      \ and adding to the campus art gallery and library, and amassing what became\
      \ a famous Dante collection. His term was not renewed by the Congregation because\
      \ of fears he had expanded Notre Dame too quickly and had run the Holy Cross\
      \ order into serious debt.\n\nIn 1919 Father James Burns became president of\
      \ Notre Dame, and in three years he produced an academic revolution that brought\
      \ the school up to national standards by adopting the elective system and moving\
      \ away from the university's traditional scholastic and classical emphasis.\
      \ By contrast, the Jesuit colleges, bastions of academic conservatism, were\
      \ reluctant to move to a system of electives; for this reason, their graduates\
      \ were shut out of Harvard Law School. Notre Dame continued to grow over the\
      \ years, adding more colleges, programs, and sports teams. By 1921, with the\
      \ addition of the College of Commerce, Notre Dame had grown from a small college\
      \ to a university with five colleges and a professional law school. The university\
      \ continued to expand and add new residence halls and buildings with each subsequent\
      \ president.\n\nOne of the main driving forces in the growth of the University\
      \ was its football team, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Knute Rockne became\
      \ head coach in 1918. Under Rockne, the Irish would post a record of 105 wins,\
      \ 12 losses, and five ties. During his 13 years the Irish won three national\
      \ championships, had five undefeated seasons, won the Rose Bowl in 1925, and\
      \ produced players such as George Gipp and the \"Four Horsemen\". Knute Rockne\
      \ has the highest winning percentage (.881) in NCAA Division I/FBS football\
      \ history. Rockne's offenses employed the Notre Dame Box and his defenses ran\
      \ a 7–2–2 scheme. The last game Rockne coached was on December 14, 1930, when\
      \ he led a group of Notre Dame all-stars against the New York Giants in New\
      \ York City.\n\nThe success of its football team made Notre Dame a household\
      \ name. The success of Notre Dame reflected rising status of Irish Americans\
      \ and Catholics in the 1920s. Catholics rallied up around the team and listened\
      \ to the games on the radio, especially when it knocked off the schools that\
      \ symbolized the Protestant establishment in America—Harvard, Yale, Princeton,\
      \ and Army. Yet this role as high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism\
      \ made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism. The most remarkable episode of\
      \ violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan, a\
      \ white supremacist and anti-catholic movement, in 1924. Nativism and anti-Catholicism,\
      \ especially when directed towards immigrants, were cornerstones of the KKK's\
      \ rhetoric, and Notre Dame was seen as a symbol of the threat posed by the Catholic\
      \ Church. The Klan decided to have a week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes\
      \ with the student body started on March 17, when students, aware of the anti-Catholic\
      \ animosity, blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South\
      \ Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia. On May 19 thousands of\
      \ students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college\
      \ president Fr. Matthew Walsh prevented any further clashes. The next day, football\
      \ coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey\
      \ the college president and refrain from further violence. A few days later\
      \ the Klavern broke up, but the hostility shown by the students was an omen\
      \ and a contribution to the downfall of the KKK in Indiana.\nHoly Cross Father\
      \ John Francis O'Hara was elected vice president in 1933 and president of Notre\
      \ Dame in 1934. During his tenure at Notre Dame, he brought numerous refugee\
      \ intellectuals to campus; he selected Frank H. Spearman, Jeremiah D. M. Ford,\
      \ Irvin Abell, and Josephine Brownson for the Laetare Medal, instituted in 1883.\
      \ O'Hara strongly believed that the Fighting Irish football team could be an\
      \ effective means to \"acquaint the public with the ideals that dominate\" Notre\
      \ Dame. He wrote, \"Notre Dame football is a spiritual service because it is\
      \ played for the honor and glory of God and of his Blessed Mother. When St.\
      \ Paul said: 'Whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all for\
      \ the glory of God,' he included football.\"\n\nThe Rev. John J. Cavanaugh,\
      \ C.S.C. served as president from 1946 to 1952. Cavanaugh's legacy at Notre\
      \ Dame in the post-war years was devoted to raising academic standards and reshaping\
      \ the university administration to suit it to an enlarged educational mission\
      \ and an expanded student body and stressing advanced studies and research at\
      \ a time when Notre Dame quadrupled in student census, undergraduate enrollment\
      \ increased by more than half, and graduate student enrollment grew fivefold.\
      \ Cavanaugh also established the Lobund Institute for Animal Studies and Notre\
      \ Dame's Medieval Institute. Cavanaugh also presided over the construction of\
      \ the Nieuwland Science Hall, Fisher Hall, and the Morris Inn, as well as the\
      \ Hall of Liberal Arts (now O'Shaughnessy Hall), made possible by a donation\
      \ from I.A. O'Shaughnessy, at the time the largest ever made to an American\
      \ Catholic university. He also established a system of advisory councils at\
      \ the university, which continue today and are vital to the university's governance\
      \ and development.\n\nThe Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, C.S.C., (1917–2015) served\
      \ as president for 35 years (1952–87) of dramatic transformations. In that time\
      \ the annual operating budget rose by a factor of 18 from $9.7 million to $176.6\
      \ million, and the endowment by a factor of 40 from $9 million to $350 million,\
      \ and research funding by a factor of 20 from $735,000 to $15 million. Enrollment\
      \ nearly doubled from 4,979 to 9,600, faculty more than doubled 389 to 950,\
      \ and degrees awarded annually doubled from 1,212 to 2,500.\n\nHesburgh is also\
      \ credited with transforming the face of Notre Dame by making it a coeducational\
      \ institution. In the mid-1960s Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College developed\
      \ a co-exchange program whereby several hundred students took classes not offered\
      \ at their home institution, an arrangement that added undergraduate women to\
      \ a campus that already had a few women in the graduate schools. After extensive\
      \ debate, merging with St. Mary's was rejected, primarily because of the differential\
      \ in faculty qualifications and pay scales. \"In American college education,\"\
      \ explained the Rev. Charles E. Sheedy, C.S.C., Notre Dame's Dean of Arts and\
      \ Letters, \"certain features formerly considered advantageous and enviable\
      \ are now seen as anachronistic and out of place... In this environment of diversity,\
      \ the integration of the sexes is a normal and expected aspect, replacing separatism.\"\
      \ Thomas Blantz, C.S.C., Notre Dame's Vice President of Student Affairs, added\
      \ that coeducation \"opened up a whole other pool of very bright students.\"\
      \ Two of the male residence halls were converted for the newly admitted female\
      \ students that first year, while two others were converted for the next school\
      \ year. In 1971 Mary Ann Proctor became the first female undergraduate; she\
      \ transferred from St. Mary's College. In 1972, Angela Sienko, who earned a\
      \ bachelor's degree in marketing, became the first woman graduate from the university.\n\
      \nIn the 18 years under the presidency of Edward Malloy, C.S.C., (1987–2005),\
      \ there was a rapid growth in the school's reputation, faculty, and resources.\
      \ He increased the faculty by more than 500 professors; the academic quality\
      \ of the student body has improved dramatically, with the average SAT score\
      \ rising from 1240 to 1360; the number of minority students more than doubled;\
      \ the endowment grew from $350 million to more than $3 billion; the annual operating\
      \ budget rose from $177 million to more than $650 million; and annual research\
      \ funding improved from $15 million to more than $70 million. Notre Dame's most\
      \ recent (2014) capital campaign raised $2.014 billion, far exceeding its goal\
      \ of $767 million, and is the largest in the history of Catholic higher education\
      \ and the largest of any University without a medical school.\n\nSince 2005,\
      \ Notre Dame has been led by John I. Jenkins, C.S.C., the 17th president of\
      \ the university. Jenkins took over the position from Malloy on July 1, 2005.\
      \ In his inaugural address, Jenkins described his goals of making the university\
      \ a leader in research that recognizes ethics and building the connection between\
      \ faith and studies. During his tenure, Notre Dame has increased its endowment,\
      \ enlarged its student body, and undergone many construction projects on campus,\
      \ including Compton Family Ice Arena, a new architecture hall, additional residence\
      \ halls, and the Campus Crossroads, a $400m enhancement and expansion of Notre\
      \ Dame Stadium.\n\nNotre Dame's campus is located in Notre Dame, Indiana, an\
      \ unincorporated community in the Michiana area of Northern Indiana, north of\
      \ South Bend and four miles (6 km) from the Michigan state line.\nIn September\
      \ 2011, \"Travel+Leisure\" listed Notre Dame as having one of the most beautiful\
      \ college campuses in the United States. Today it lies on just south of the\
      \ Indiana Toll Road and includes 143 buildings located on quads throughout the\
      \ campus.\n\nDevelopment of the campus began in the spring of 1843, when Fr.\
      \ Sorin and some of his congregation built the \"Old College,\" a building used\
      \ for dormitories, a bakery, and a classroom. A year later, after an architect\
      \ arrived, a small \"Main Building\" was built allowing for the launch of the\
      \ college. The Main Building burned down in 1879, and it was immediately replaced\
      \ with the current one. It was topped with the Golden Dome, which today has\
      \ become Notre Dame's most distinguishable feature. Close to the Main Building\
      \ stands Washington Hall (University of Notre Dame), a theater that was built\
      \ in 1881 and has since then been used for theatrical and musical representation.\n\
      Because of its Catholic identity, a number of religious buildings stand on campus.\
      \ The Old College building has become one of two seminaries on campus run by\
      \ the Congregation of Holy Cross. The current Basilica of the Sacred Heart is\
      \ located on the spot of Fr. Sorin's original church, which became too small\
      \ for the growing college. It is built in French Revival style and it is decorated\
      \ by stained glass windows imported directly from France. The interior was painted\
      \ by Luigi Gregori, an Italian painter invited by Fr. Sorin to be artist in\
      \ residence. The Basilica also features a bell tower with a carillon. Inside\
      \ the church there are also sculptures by Ivan Mestrovic. The Grotto of Our\
      \ Lady of Lourdes, which was built in 1896, is a replica of the original in\
      \ Lourdes, France. It is very popular among students and alumni as a place of\
      \ prayer and meditation, and it is considered one of the most beloved spots\
      \ on campus.\n\nA Science Hall was built in 1883 under the direction of Fr.\
      \ Zahm, but in 1950 it was converted to a student union building and named LaFortune\
      \ Center, after Joseph LaFortune, an oil executive from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Commonly\
      \ known as \"LaFortune\" or \"LaFun,\" it is a 4-story building of that provides\
      \ the Notre Dame community with a meeting place for social, recreational, cultural,\
      \ and educational activities. LaFortune employs 35 part-time student staff and\
      \ 29 full-time non-student staff and has an annual budget of $1.2 million.\n\
      Many businesses, services, and divisions of The Office of Student Affairs are\
      \ found within. The building also houses restaurants from national restaurant\
      \ chains.\nSince the construction of its oldest buildings, the university's\
      \ physical plant has grown substantially. Over the years 29 residence halls\
      \ have been built to accommodate students and each has been constructed with\
      \ its own chapel. Many academic building were added together with a system of\
      \ libraries, the most prominent of which is the Theodore Hesburgh Library, built\
      \ in 1963 and today containing almost 4 million books. Since 2004, several buildings\
      \ have been added, including the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the Guglielmino\
      \ Complex, and the Jordan Hall of Science. Additionally, a new residence for\
      \ men, Duncan Hall, was begun on March 8, 2007, and began accepting residents\
      \ for the Fall 2008 semester. Ryan Hall was completed and began housing undergraduate\
      \ women in the fall of 2009. A new engineering building, Stinson-Remick Hall,\
      \ a new combination Center for Social Concerns/Institute for Church Life building,\
      \ Geddes Hall, and a law school addition have recently been completed as well.\
      \ Additionally the new hockey arena opened in the fall of 2011. The Stayer Center\
      \ for Executive Education, which houses the Mendoza College of Business Executive\
      \ Education Department opened in March 2013 just South of the Mendoza College\
      \ of Business building. Because of its long athletic tradition, the university\
      \ features also many building dedicated to sport. The most famous is Notre Dame\
      \ Stadium, home of the Fighting Irish football team; it has been renovated several\
      \ times and today it can hold more than 80 thousand people. Prominent venues\
      \ include also the Edmund P. Joyce Center, with indoor basketball and volleyball\
      \ courts, and the Compton Family Ice Arena, a two-rink facility dedicated to\
      \ hockey. Also, there are many outdoor fields, as the Frank Eck Stadium for\
      \ baseball.\nLegends of Notre Dame (commonly referred to as Legends) is a music\
      \ venue, public house, and restaurant located on the campus of the University\
      \ of Notre Dame, just south of Notre Dame Stadium. The former Alumni Senior\
      \ Club opened its doors the first weekend in September 2003 after a $3.5 million\
      \ renovation and transformed into the all-ages student hang-out that currently\
      \ exists. Legends is made up of two parts: The Restaurant and Alehouse and the\
      \ nightclub.\n\nThe University of Notre Dame has made being a sustainability\
      \ leader an integral part of its mission, creating the Office of Sustainability\
      \ in 2008 to achieve a number of goals in the areas of power generation, design\
      \ and construction, waste reduction, procurement, food services, transportation,\
      \ and water.<ref name=\"About the Office//Office of Sustainability//University\

      \ Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2010, University of Notre Dame\
      \ received a \"B\" grade. The university also houses the Kellog Institute for\
      \ International Peace Studies. Father Gustavo Gutierrez, the founder of Liberation\
      \ Theology is a current faculty member.\n\nThe university owns several centers\
      \ around the world used for international studies and research, conferences\
      \ abroad, and alumni support.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the five Global Getaways,\
      \ the University also holds a presence in Chicago where it owns the Santa Fe\
      \ Building (Chicago).\n\nThe university of Notre Dame is under the leadership\
      \ of the president, who is a priest of the Congregation of Holy Cross. The first\
      \ president was Fr. Edward Sorin and the current president is Fr. John I. Jenkins.\
      \ As of 2016, the provost of the university, who oversees academic functions,\
      \ is Thomas Burish.\nUntil 1967 Notre Dame had been governed directly by the\
      \ Congregation, but under the presidency of the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh two groups,\
      \ the Board of Fellows and the Board of Trustees were established to govern\
      \ the University. The Fellows are a group of six Holy Cross religious and six\
      \ lay members who have final say over the operation of the university. The Fellows\
      \ vote on potential trustees and sign off on all major decisions by that body.\
      \ The Trustees elect the president and provide general guidance and governance\
      \ to the university.\n\nNotre Dame's financial endowment was started in the\
      \ early 1920s by university president James Burns, and increased to US$7 million\
      \ by 1952 when Hesburgh became president. By the 1980s it reached $150 million,\
      \ and in 2000, it returned a record 57.9% investment. For the 2007 fiscal year,\
      \ the endowment had grown to approximately $6.5 billion, putting the university\
      \ in the top-15 largest endowments in the country. As of September 2015, Notre\
      \ Dame's endowment was valued over $10 billion.\n\nAs of fall 2014, Notre Dame\
      \ had 12,292 students and employed 1,126 full-time faculty members and another\
      \ 190 part-time members to give a student/faculty ratio of 8:1.\n\n\nAll of\
      \ Notre Dame's undergraduate students are a part of one of the five undergraduate\
      \ colleges at the school or are in the \"First Year of Studies program\".\n\
      The First Year of Studies program was established in 1962 to guide incoming\
      \ freshmen in their first year at the school before they have declared a major.\
      \ Each student is given an academic advisor from the program who helps them\
      \ to choose classes that give them exposure to any major in which they are interested.\
      \ The program also includes a Learning Resource Center which provides time management,\
      \ collaborative learning, and subject tutoring. This program has been recognized\
      \ previously, by \"U.S. News & World Report\", as outstanding. The program is\
      \ designed to encourage intellectual and academic achievement and innovation\
      \ among first year students. It includes programs such as FY advising, the Dean's\
      \ A list, the Renaissance circle, NDignite, the First year Urban challenge and\
      \ more.\n\nEach admissions cycle, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions selects\
      \ a small number of students for the Glynn Family Honors Program, which grants\
      \ top students within the College of Arts and Letters and the College of Science\
      \ access to smaller class sizes taught by distinguished faculty, endowed funding\
      \ for independent research, and dedicated advising faculty and staff.\n\nThe\
      \ university first offered graduate degrees, in the form of a Master of Arts\
      \ (MA), in the 1854–1855 academic year. The program expanded to include Master\
      \ of Laws (LL.M.) and Master of Civil Engineering in its early stages of growth,\
      \ before a formal graduate school education was developed with a thesis not\
      \ required to receive the degrees. This changed in 1924 with formal requirements\
      \ developed for graduate degrees, including offering Doctorate (PhD) degrees.\n\
      \nIn 2014, Notre Dame announced plans to establish the \"Donald R. Keough School\
      \ of Global Affairs\", a professional school focused on the study of global\
      \ government, human rights, and other areas of global social and political policy.\
      \ The creation of the school is funded by a $50 million gift from Donald Keough\
      \ and Marilyn Keough and will be housed in Jenkins Hall on Debartolo Quad. The\
      \ school is scheduled to open in August 2017.\n\nThe library system of the university\
      \ is divided between the main library and each of the colleges and schools.\
      \ The main building is the 14-story Theodore M. Hesburgh Library, completed\
      \ in 1963, which is the third building to house the main collection of books.\
      \ The front of the library is adorned with the Word of Life mural designed by\
      \ artist Millard Sheets. This mural is popularly known as \"Touchdown Jesus\"\
      \ because of its proximity to Notre Dame Stadium and Jesus' arms appearing to\
      \ make the signal for a touchdown.\n\nThe library system also includes branch\
      \ libraries for Architecture, Chemistry and Physics, Engineering, Law, and Mathematics\
      \ as well as information centers in the Mendoza College of Business, the Kellogg\
      \ Institute for International Studies, the Joan B. Kroc Institute for International\
      \ Peace Studies, and a slide library in O'Shaughnessy Hall. A theology library\
      \ was also opened in fall of 2015. Located on the first floor of Stanford Hall,\
      \ it is the first branch of the library system to be housed in a dorm room.\
      \ The library system holds over three million volumes, was the single largest\
      \ university library in the world upon its completion, and remains one of the\
      \ 100 largest libraries in the country.\n\nNotre Dame is known for its competitive\
      \ admissions, with the incoming class enrolling in fall 2016 admitting 3,655\
      \ from a pool of 19,505 (18.7%). The academic profile of the enrolled class\
      \ continues to rate among the top 10 to 15 in the nation for national research\
      \ universities. Of the most recent class, the Class of 2020, 48% were in the\
      \ top 1% of their high school, and 94% were in the top 10%. The median SAT score\
      \ was 1510 and the median ACt score was 34. The university practices a non-restrictive\
      \ early action policy that allows admitted students to consider admission to\
      \ Notre Dame as well as any other colleges to which they were accepted. 1,400\
      \ of the 3,577 (39.1%) were admitted under the early action plan. Admitted students\
      \ came from 1,311 high schools and the average student traveled more than 750\
      \ miles to Notre Dame, making it arguably the most representative university\
      \ in the United States. While all entering students begin in the College of\
      \ the First Year of Studies, 25% have indicated they plan to study in the liberal\
      \ arts or social sciences, 24% in engineering, 24% in business, 24% in science,\
      \ and 3% in architecture.\n\nIn 2016–2017, Notre Dame ranked 7th for undegraduate\
      \ teaching and 15th overall among \"national universities\" in the United States\
      \ in \"U.S. News & World Report\"s \"Best Colleges 2016\". In 2014, \"USA Today\"\
      \ ranked Notre Dame 10th overall for American universities. \"Forbes\"'s \"\
      America's Top Colleges\" ranks Notre Dame 13th among colleges in the United\
      \ States in 2016, 8th among Research Universities, and 1st in the Midwest. \"\
      U.S. News & World Report\" also lists Notre Dame Law School as 22nd overall.\
      \ \"BusinessWeek\" ranks Mendoza College of Business undergraduate school as\
      \ 1st overall. It ranks the MBA program as 20th overall. The Philosophical Gourmet\
      \ Report ranks Notre Dame's graduate philosophy program as 15th nationally,\
      \ while \"ARCHITECT\" Magazine ranked the undergraduate architecture program\
      \ as 12th nationally.\nAdditionally, the study abroad program ranks sixth in\
      \ highest participation percentage in the nation, with 57.6% of students choosing\
      \ to study abroad in 17 countries. According to PayScale, undergraduate alumni\
      \ of University of Notre Dame have a mid-career median salary $110,000, making\
      \ it the 24th highest among colleges and universities in the United States.\
      \ The median starting salary of $55,300 ranked 58th in the same peer group.\n\
      \nNamed by \"Newsweek\" as one of the \"25 New Ivies,\" it is also an Oak Ridge\
      \ Associated University.\n\nFather Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. was Director of the\
      \ Science Museum and the Library and Professor of Chemistry and Physics until\
      \ 1874. Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress\
      \ were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed\
      \ by the Church. One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm who\
      \ was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and\
      \ by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active\
      \ in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to\
      \ contemporary intellectual issues. His book \"Evolution and Dogma\" (1896)\
      \ defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover,\
      \ that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something\
      \ like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's\
      \ censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt\
      \ embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.\n\nIn 1882, Albert Zahm\
      \ (John Zahm's brother) built an early wind tunnel used to compare lift to drag\
      \ of aeronautical models. Around 1899, Professor Jerome Green became the first\
      \ American to send a wireless message. In 1931, Father Julius Nieuwland performed\
      \ early work on basic reactions that was used to create neoprene. Study of nuclear\
      \ physics at the university began with the building of a nuclear accelerator\
      \ in 1936, and continues now partly through a partnership in the Joint Institute\
      \ for Nuclear Astrophysics.\n\nThe Lobund Institute (Laboratory Of Biology University\
      \ of Notre Dame) grew out of pioneering research in germ-free-life which began\
      \ in 1928. This area of research originated in a question posed by Pasteur as\
      \ to whether animal life was possible without bacteria. Though others had taken\
      \ up this idea, their research was short lived and inconclusive. Lobund was\
      \ the first research organization to answer definitively, that such life is\
      \ possible and that it can be prolonged through generations. But the objective\
      \ was not merely to answer Pasteur's question but also to produce the germ free\
      \ animal as a new tool for biological and medical research. This objective was\
      \ reached and for years Lobund was a unique center for the study and production\
      \ of germ free animals and for their use in biological and medical investigations.\
      \ Today the work has spread to other universities. In the beginning it was under\
      \ the Department of Biology and a program leading to the master's degree accompanied\
      \ the research program. In the 1940s Lobund achieved independent status as a\
      \ purely research organization and in 1950 was raised to the status of an Institute.\
      \ In 1958 it was brought back into the Department of Biology as integral part\
      \ of that department, but with its own program leading to the degree of PhD\
      \ in Gnotobiotics.\nRichard T. Sullivan taught English from 1936 to 1974 and\
      \ published six novels, dozens of short stories, and various other efforts.\
      \ He was known as a regional writer and a Catholic spokesman.\n\nFrank O'Malley\
      \ was an English professor during the 1930s–1960s. Influenced by philosophers\
      \ Jacques Maritain, John U. Nef, and others, O'Malley developed a concept of\
      \ Christian philosophy that was a fundamental element in his thought. Through\
      \ his course \"Modern Catholic Writers\" O'Malley introduced generations of\
      \ undergraduates to Gabriel Marcel, Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh, Sigrid Undset,\
      \ Paul Claudel, and Gerard Manley Hopkins.\n\n\"The Review of Politics\" was\
      \ founded in 1939 by Waldemar Gurian, modeled after German Catholic journals.\
      \ It quickly emerged as part of an international Catholic intellectual revival,\
      \ offering an alternative vision to positivist philosophy. For 44 years, the\
      \ \"Review\" was edited by Gurian, Matthew Fitzsimons, Frederick Crosson, and\
      \ Thomas Stritch. Intellectual leaders included Gurian, Jacques Maritain, Frank\
      \ O'Malley, Leo Richard Ward, F. A. Hermens, and John U. Nef. It became a major\
      \ forum for political ideas and modern political concerns, especially from a\
      \ Catholic and scholastic tradition.\n\nKenneth Sayre has explored the history\
      \ of the Philosophy department. He stresses the abandonment of official Thomism\
      \ to the philosophical pluralism of the 1970s, with attention to the issue of\
      \ being Catholic. He pays special attention to the charismatic personalities\
      \ of Ernan McMullin and Ralph McInerny, key leaders of the department in the\
      \ 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe rise of Hitler and other dictators in the 1930s forced\
      \ numerous Catholic intellectuals to flee Europe; president John O'Hara brought\
      \ many to Notre Dame. From Germany came Anton-Hermann Chroust (1907–1982) in\
      \ classics and law, and Waldemar Gurian a German Catholic intellectual of Jewish\
      \ descent. Positivism dominated American intellectual life in the 1920s onward\
      \ but in marked contrast, Gurian received a German Catholic education and wrote\
      \ his doctoral dissertation under Max Scheler. Ivan Meštrović (1883–1962), a\
      \ renowned sculptor, brought Croatian culture to campus, 1955–62. Yves Simon\
      \ (1903–61), brought to ND in the 1940s the insights of French studies in the\
      \ Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition of philosophy; his own teacher Jacques Maritain\
      \ (1882–73) was a frequent visitor to campus.\n\nThe exiles developed a distinctive\
      \ emphasis on the evils of totalitarianism. For example, the political science\
      \ courses of Gerhart Niemeyer (1907–97) discussed communist ideology and were\
      \ particularly accessible to his students. He came to ND in 1955, and was a\
      \ frequent contributor to the \"National Review\" and other conservative magazines.\n\
      \n research continued in many fields. The university president, John Jenkins,\
      \ described his hope that Notre Dame would become \"one of the pre–eminent research\
      \ institutions in the world\" in his inaugural address. The university has many\
      \ multi-disciplinary institutes devoted to research in varying fields, including\
      \ the Medieval Institute, the Kellogg Institute for International Studies, the\
      \ Kroc Institute for International Peace studies, and the Center for Social\
      \ Concerns. Recent research includes work on family conflict and child development,\
      \ genome mapping, the increasing trade deficit of the United States with China,\
      \ studies in fluid mechanics, computational science and engineering, and marketing\
      \ trends on the Internet. As of 2013, the university is home to the Notre Dame\
      \ Global Adaptation Index which ranks countries annually based on how vulnerable\
      \ they are to climate change and how prepared they are to adapt.\n\nIn 2014\
      \ the Notre Dame student body consisted of 12,179 students, with 8,448 undergraduates,\
      \ 2,138 graduate and professional and 1,593 professional (Law, M.Div., Business,\
      \ M.Ed.) students. Around 21–24% of students are children of alumni, and although\
      \ 37% of students come from the Midwestern United States, the student body represents\
      \ all 50 states and 100 countries. 32% of students are U.S. students of color\
      \ or international citizens. \"The Princeton Review\" ranked the school as the\
      \ fifth highest 'dream school' for parents to send their children. The \"Princeton\
      \ Review\" ranked Notre Dame as the ninth highest. It has also been commended\
      \ by some diversity oriented publications; \"Hispanic Magazine\" in 2004 ranked\
      \ the university ninth on its list of the top–25 colleges for Latinos, and \"\
      The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education\" recognized the university in 2006\
      \ for raising enrollment of African-American students. With 6,000 participants,\
      \ the university's intramural sports program was named in 2004 by \"Sports Illustrated\"\
      \ as the best program in the country, while in 2007 \"The Princeton Review\"\
      \ named it as the top school where \"Everyone Plays Intramural Sports.\" The\
      \ annual Bookstore Basketball tournament is the largest outdoor five-on-five\
      \ tournament in the world with over 700 teams participating each year, while\
      \ the Notre Dame Men's Boxing Club hosts the annual Bengal Bouts tournament\
      \ that raises money for the Holy Cross Missions in Bangladesh.\n\nThe strictly\
      \ measured federal graduation rate for athletes was 90% for freshmen who entered\
      \ between 2005 and 2008. This is the second highest in the country.\n\nAbout\
      \ 80% of undergraduates and 20% of graduate students live on campus. The majority\
      \ of the graduate students on campus live in one of four graduate housing complexes\
      \ on campus, while all on-campus undergraduates live in one of the 31 residence\
      \ halls. Because of the religious affiliation of the university, all residence\
      \ halls are single-sex, with 16 male dorms and 15 female dorms. The university\
      \ maintains a visiting policy (known as parietal hours) for those students who\
      \ live in dormitories, specifying times when members of the opposite sex are\
      \ allowed to visit other students' dorm rooms; however, all residence halls\
      \ have 24-hour social spaces for students regardless of gender. Many residence\
      \ halls have at least one nun and/or priest as a resident. There are no traditional\
      \ social fraternities or sororities at the university, but a majority of students\
      \ live in the same residence hall for all four years. Some intramural sports\
      \ are based on residence hall teams, where the university offers the only non-military\
      \ academy program of full-contact intramural American football. At the end of\
      \ the intramural season, the championship game is played on the field in Notre\
      \ Dame Stadium.\n\nThe university is affiliated with the Congregation of Holy\
      \ Cross (Latin: \"Congregatio a Sancta Cruce\", abbreviated postnominals: \"\
      CSC\"). While religious affiliation is not a criterion for admission, more than\
      \ 93% of students identify as Christian, with over 80% of the total being Catholic.\
      \ Collectively, Catholic Mass is celebrated over 100 times per week on campus,\
      \ and a large campus ministry program provides for the faith needs of the community.\
      \ There are multitudes of religious statues and artwork around campus, most\
      \ prominent of which are the statue of Mary on the Main Building, the Notre\
      \ Dame Grotto, and the Word of Life mural on Hesburgh Library depicting Christ\
      \ as a teacher. Additionally, every classroom displays a crucifix. There are\
      \ many religious clubs (Catholic and non-Catholic) at the school, including\
      \ Council #1477 of the Knights of Columbus (KOC), Baptist Collegiate Ministry\
      \ (BCM), Jewish Club, Muslim Student Association, Orthodox Christian Fellowship,\
      \ The Mormon Club, and many more. The Notre Dame KofC are known for being the\
      \ first collegiate council of KofC, operating a charitable concession stand\
      \ during every home football game and owning their own building on campus which\
      \ can be used as a cigar lounge. Fifty-seven chapels are located throughout\
      \ the campus.\n\nArchitecturally, the school has a Catholic character. Atop\
      \ the Main Building's gold dome is a golden statue of the Virgin Mary. Immediately\
      \ in front of the Main Building and facing it, is a copper statue of Christ\
      \ with arms upraised with the legend \"\"Venite Ad Me Omnes\"\" (Come to me,\
      \ all ye). Next to the Main Building is the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Immediately\
      \ behind the basilica is the Grotto, a Marian place of prayer and reflection.\
      \ It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, France where the Virgin Mary reputedly\
      \ appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 1858. At the end of the main drive\
      \ (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and the Gold Dome),\
      \ is a simple, modern stone statue of Mary.\n\nThe university is the major seat\
      \ of the Congregation of Holy Cross (albeit not its official headquarters, which\
      \ are in Rome). Its main seminary, Moreau Seminary, is located on the campus\
      \ across St. Joseph lake from the Main Building. Old College, the oldest building\
      \ on campus and located near the shore of St. Mary lake, houses undergraduate\
      \ seminarians. Retired priests and brothers reside in Fatima House (a former\
      \ retreat center), Holy Cross House, as well as Columba Hall near the Grotto.\n\
      \nThe university has a highly regarded theology program, both undergraduate\
      \ and graduate, with many scholars, including Lawrence Cunningham, John Cavadini,\
      \ and Gary Anderson. The chair of the department, John Cavadini, was appointed\
      \ to the International Theological Commission by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010;\
      \ Prof. Brian E. Daley, SJ, received the Ratzinger Prize in Theology in 2012.\n\
      As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media\
      \ outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio\
      \ and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page\
      \ journal in September 1876, the \"Scholastic\" magazine is issued twice monthly\
      \ and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United\
      \ States. The other magazine, \"The Juggler\", is released twice a year and\
      \ focuses on student literature and artwork. The \"Dome\" yearbook is published\
      \ annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with \"The Observer\"\
      \ published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed\
      \ by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike \"Scholastic\"\
      \ and \"The Dome,\" \"The Observer\" is an independent publication and does\
      \ not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University.\
      \ In 1987, when some students believed that \"The Observer\" began to show a\
      \ conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, \"Common Sense\" was published. Likewise,\
      \ in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias,\
      \ the conservative paper \"Irish Rover\" went into production. Neither paper\
      \ is published as often as \"The Observer\"; however, all three are distributed\
      \ to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political\
      \ science research, \"Beyond Politics\", made its debut.\n\nThe television station,\
      \ NDtv, grew from one show in 2002 to a full 24-hour channel with original programming\
      \ by September 2006. WSND-FM serves the student body and larger South Bend community\
      \ at 88.9 FM, offering students a chance to become involved in bringing classical\
      \ music, fine arts and educational programming, and alternative rock to the\
      \ airwaves. Another radio station, WVFI, began as a partner of WSND-FM. More\
      \ recently, however, WVFI has been airing independently and is streamed on the\
      \ Internet.\n\nThe first phase of Eddy Street Commons, a $215 million development\
      \ located adjacent to the University of Notre Dame campus and funded by the\
      \ university, broke ground on June 3, 2008. The Eddy Street Commons drew union\
      \ protests when workers hired by the City of South Bend to construct the public\
      \ parking garage picketed the private work site after a contractor hired non-union\
      \ workers. The developer, Kite Realty out of Indianapolis, has made agreements\
      \ with major national chains rather than local businesses, a move that has led\
      \ to criticism from alumni and students.\n\nNotre Dame teams are known as the\
      \ Fighting Irish. They compete as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic\
      \ Association (NCAA) Division I, primarily competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference\
      \ (ACC) for all sports since the 2013–14 school year. The Fighting Irish previously\
      \ competed in the Horizon League from 1982–83 to 1985–86, and again from 1987–88\
      \ to 1994–95, and then in the Big East Conference through 2012–13. Men's sports\
      \ include baseball, basketball, crew, cross country, fencing, football, golf,\
      \ ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis and track & field;\
      \ while women's sports include basketball, cross country, fencing, golf, lacrosse,\
      \ rowing, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, and\
      \ volleyball. The football team competes as an Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS)\
      \ Independent since its inception in 1887. Both fencing teams compete in the\
      \ Midwest Fencing Conference, and the men's ice hockey team competes in Hockey\
      \ East.\n\nNotre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except\
      \ football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference\
      \ realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish\
      \ left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in\
      \ the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed\
      \ to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish\
      \ were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision\
      \ to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated\
      \ in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate\
      \ Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey\
      \ team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced\
      \ it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school\
      \ year.\nThere are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker\
      \ but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with\
      \ respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace\
      \ in his \"New York Daily News\" columns. The official colors of Notre Dame\
      \ are navy blue and gold which are worn in competition by its athletic teams.\
      \ In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname.\
      \ The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by\
      \ Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket\
      \ schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured\
      \ on the cover of \"Time\" in November 1964 and gained national exposure.\n\n\
      On July 1, 2014, the University of Notre Dame and Under Armour reached an agreement\
      \ in which Under Armour will provide uniforms, apparel,equipment, and monetary\
      \ compensation to Notre Dame for 10 years. This contract, worth almost $100\
      \ million, is the most lucrative in the history of the NCAA.\nThe university\
      \ marching band plays at home games for most of the sports. The band, which\
      \ began in 1846 and has a claim as the oldest university band in continuous\
      \ existence in the United States, was honored by the National Music Council\
      \ as a \"Landmark of American Music\" during the United States Bicentennial.\
      \ The band regularly plays the school's fight song the \"Notre Dame Victory\
      \ March\", which was named as the most played and most famous fight song by\
      \ Northern Illinois Professor William Studwell. According to \"College Fight\
      \ Songs: An Annotated Anthology\" published in 1998, the \"Notre Dame Victory\
      \ March\" ranks as the greatest fight song of all time.\n\nAccording to some\
      \ analysts without direct connection to the university or its athletic department,\
      \ Notre Dame promotes Muscular Christianity through its athletic programs.\n\
      \nThe Notre Dame football team has a long history, first beginning when the\
      \ Michigan Wolverines football team brought football to Notre Dame in 1887 and\
      \ played against a group of students. In the long history since then, 13 Fighting\
      \ Irish teams have won consensus national championships (although the university\
      \ only claims 11), along with another nine teams being named national champion\
      \ by at least one source. Additionally, the program has the most members in\
      \ the College Football Hall of Fame, is tied with Ohio State University with\
      \ the most Heisman Trophies won, and have the highest winning percentage in\
      \ NCAA history. With the long history, Notre Dame has accumulated many rivals,\
      \ and its annual game against USC for the Jeweled Shillelagh has been named\
      \ by some as one of the most important in college football and is often called\
      \ the greatest intersectional rivalry in college football in the country.\n\n\
      George Gipp was the school's legendary football player during 1916–20. He played\
      \ semiprofessional baseball and smoked, drank, and gambled when not playing\
      \ sports. He was also humble, generous to the needy, and a man of integrity.\
      \ It was in 1928 that famed coach Knute Rockne used his final conversation with\
      \ the dying Gipp to inspire the Notre Dame team to beat the Army team and \"\
      win one for the Gipper.\" The 1940 film, \"Knute Rockne, All American\", starred\
      \ Pat O'Brien as Knute Rockne and Ronald Reagan as Gipp.\nThe team competes\
      \ in Notre Dame Stadium, an 80,795-seat stadium on campus. The current head\
      \ coach is Brian Kelly, hired from the University of Cincinnati on December\
      \ 11, 2009. Kelly's record in midway through his sixth season at Notre Dame\
      \ is 52–21. In 2012, Kelly's Fighting Irish squad went undefeated and played\
      \ in the BCS National Championship Game. Kelly succeeded Charlie Weis, who was\
      \ fired in November 2009 after five seasons. Although Weis led his team to two\
      \ Bowl Championship Series bowl games, his overall record was 35–27, mediocre\
      \ by Notre Dame standards, and the 2007 team had the most losses in school history.\
      \ The football team generates enough revenue to operate independently while\
      \ $22.1 million is retained from the team's profits for academic use. \"Forbes\"\
      \ named the team as the most valuable in college football, worth a total of\
      \ $101 million in 2007.\nFootball gameday traditions\nDuring home games, activities\
      \ occur all around campus and different dorms decorate their halls with a traditional\
      \ item (e.g., Zahm Hall's two-story banner). Traditional activities begin at\
      \ the stroke of midnight with the Drummers' Circle. This tradition involves\
      \ the drum line of the Band of the Fighting Irish and ushers in the rest of\
      \ the festivities that will continue the rest of the gameday Saturday. Later\
      \ that day, the trumpet section will play the Notre Dame Victory March and the\
      \ Notre Dame Alma Mater under the dome. The entire band will play a concert\
      \ at the steps of Bond Hall, from where they will march into Notre Dame Stadium,\
      \ leading fans and students alike across the campus to the game.\n\nAs of the\
      \ 2014–2015 season, the men's basketball team has over 1,898 wins, one of only\
      \ 8 schools with more wins, and have appeared in 28 NCAA tournaments. Former\
      \ player Austin Carr holds the record for most points scored in a single game\
      \ of the tournament with 61. Although the team has never won the NCAA Tournament,\
      \ they were named by the Helms Athletic Foundation as national champions twice.\
      \ The team has orchestrated a number of upsets of number one ranked teams, the\
      \ most notable of which was ending UCLA's record 88-game winning streak in 1974.\
      \ The team has beaten an additional eight number-one teams, and those nine wins\
      \ rank second, to UCLA's 10, all-time in wins against the top team. The team\
      \ plays in newly renovated Purcell Pavilion (within the Edmund P. Joyce Center),\
      \ which reopened for the beginning of the 2009–2010 season. The team is coached\
      \ by Mike Brey, who, as of the 2015–16 season, his fifteenth at Notre Dame,\
      \ has achieved a 356–177 record. In 2009 they were invited to the NIT, where\
      \ they advanced to the semifinals but were beaten by Penn State who went on\
      \ and beat Baylor in the championship. The 2010–11 team concluded its regular\
      \ season ranked number seven in the country, with a record of 25–5, Brey's fifth\
      \ straight 20-win season, and a second-place finish in the Big East. During\
      \ the 2014–15 season, the team went 32–6 and won the ACC conference tournament,\
      \ later advancing to the Elite 8, where the Fighting Irish lost on a missed\
      \ buzzer-beater against then undefeated Kentucky. Led by NBA draft picks Jerian\
      \ Grant and Pat Connaughton, the Fighting Irish beat the eventual national champion\
      \ Duke Blue Devils twice during the season. The 32 wins were the most by the\
      \ Fighting Irish team since 1908–09.\n\nNotre Dame has been successful in other\
      \ sports besides football, with an additional 14 national championships in various\
      \ sports. Three teams have won multiple national championships with the fencing\
      \ team leading them with seven, followed by the men's tennis and women's soccer\
      \ teams each with two. The men's cross country, men's golf, and women's basketball\
      \ teams have each won one in their histories.\n\nIn the first ten years that\
      \ Notre Dame competed in the Big East Conference its teams won a total of 64\
      \ championships. As of 2010, the women's swimming and diving team holds the\
      \ Big East record for consecutive conference championships in any sport with\
      \ 14 straight conference titles (1997–2010).\n\nThe Band of the Fighting Irish\
      \ is the oldest university band in continuous existence. It was formed in 1846.\
      \ The all-male Glee Club was formed in 1915. The Internationally recognized\
      \ \"Notre Dame Folk Choir\" was founded by Steven \"Cookie\" Warner in 1980.\n\
      \nThe \"Notre Dame Victory March\" is the fight song for the University of Notre\
      \ Dame. It was written by two brothers who were Notre Dame graduates. The Rev.\
      \ Michael J. Shea, a 1904 graduate, wrote the music, and his brother, John F.\
      \ Shea, who earned degrees in 1906 and 1908, wrote the original lyrics. The\
      \ lyrics were revised in the 1920s; it first appeared under the copyright of\
      \ the University of Notre Dame in 1928. The chorus is, \"Cheer cheer for old\
      \ Notre Dame, wake up the echos cheering her name. Send a volley cheer on high,\
      \ shake down the thunder from the sky! What though the odds be great or small,\
      \ old Notre Dame will win over all. While her loyal sons are marching, onward\
      \ to victory!\"\n\nThe chorus of the song is one of the most recognizable collegiate\
      \ fight songs in the United States, and was ranked first among fight songs by\
      \ Northern Illinois University Professor William Studwell, who remarked it was\
      \ \"more borrowed, more famous and, frankly, you just hear it more\".\n\nIn\
      \ the film \"Knute Rockne, All American\", Knute Rockne (played by Pat O'Brien)\
      \ delivers the famous \"Win one for the Gipper\" speech, at which point the\
      \ background music swells with the \"Notre Dame Victory March\". George Gipp\
      \ was played by Ronald Reagan, whose nickname \"The Gipper\" was derived from\
      \ this role. This scene was parodied in the movie \"Airplane!\" with the same\
      \ background music, only this time honoring George Zipp, one of Ted Striker's\
      \ former comrades. The song also was prominent in the movie \"Rudy\", with Sean\
      \ Astin as Daniel \"Rudy\" Ruettiger, who harbored dreams of playing football\
      \ at the University of Notre Dame despite significant obstacles.\n\nNotre Dame\
      \ alumni number near 120,000, and are members of 275 alumni clubs around the\
      \ world. Many alumni give yearly monetary support to the university, with a\
      \ school-record 53.2% giving some donation in 2006. Many buildings on campus\
      \ are named for those whose donations allowed their building, including residence\
      \ halls, classroom buildings, and the performing arts center.\n\nNotre Dame\
      \ alumni work in various fields. Alumni working in political fields include\
      \ state governors, members of the United States Congress, and former United\
      \ States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Notable alumni from the College\
      \ of Science are Eric F. Wieschaus, winner of the 1995 Nobel Prize in medicine,\
      \ and Philip Majerus, discoverer of the cardioprotective effects of aspirin.\
      \ A number of university heads are alumni, including Notre Dame's current president,\
      \ the Rev. John Jenkins. Additionally, many alumni are in the media, including\
      \ talk show hosts Regis Philbin and Phil Donahue, and television and radio personalities\
      \ such as Mike Golic and Hannah Storm. With the university having high-profile\
      \ sports teams itself, a number of alumni went on to become involved in athletics\
      \ outside the university, including professional baseball, basketball, football,\
      \ and ice hockey players, such as Joe Theismann, Joe Montana, Tim Brown, Ross\
      \ Browner, Rocket Ismail, Ruth Riley, Jeff Samardzija, Jerome Bettis, Brett\
      \ Lebda, Olympic gold medalist Mariel Zagunis, professional boxer Mike Lee,\
      \ former football coaches such as Charlie Weis, Frank Leahy and Knute Rockne,\
      \ and Basketball Hall of Famers Austin Carr and Adrian Dantley. Other notable\
      \ alumni include prominent businessman Edward J. DeBartolo, Jr. and astronaut\

    text: "\nThe University of Notre Dame du Lac (or simply Notre Dame ) is a Catholic\
      \ research university located adjacent to South Bend, Indiana, in the United\
      \ States. In French, \"Notre Dame du Lac\" means \"Our Lady of the Lake\" and\
      \ refers to the university's patron saint, the Virgin Mary. The main campus\
      \ covers in a suburban setting and it contains a number of recognizable landmarks,\
      \ such as the Golden Dome, the \"Word of Life\" mural (commonly known as Touchdown\
      \ Jesus), and the Basilica. The school was founded on November 26, 1842, by\
      \ Father Edward Sorin, CSC, who was also its first president, as an all-male\
      \ institution on land donated by the Bishop of Vincennes (Indiana). Today, many\
      \ Holy Cross priests continue to work for the university, including the president\
      \ of the university.\n\nNotre Dame is a large, four-year, highly residential\
      \ research university. It is consistently ranked among the top twenty universities\
      \ in the United States and as a major global university and is highly regarded\
      \ for its undergraduate education. Notre Dame is also ranked as one of the top\
      \ research universities and it has one of the largest endowments in the nation\
      \ with over $10 billion. Undergraduate students are organized into four colleges\
      \ (Arts and Letters, Science, Engineering, Business), and the Architecture School.\
      \ The latter is known for teaching New Classical Architecture and for awarding\
      \ the globally renowned annual Driehaus Architecture Prize.\n\nThe university\
      \ offers over 50 foreign study abroad yearlong programs and over 15 summer programs.\
      \ Notre Dame's graduate program has more than 50 master, doctoral and professional\
      \ degree programs offered by the five schools, with the addition of the Notre\
      \ Dame Law School and a MD-PhD program offered in combination with IU medical\
      \ School. It maintains a system of libraries, cultural venues, artistic and\
      \ scientific museums, including the Hesburgh Library and the Snite Museum of\
      \ Art. The university boasts one of the largest Navy ROTC programs in the nation.\
      \ Over 80% of the university's 8,000 undergraduates live on campus in one of\
      \ 29 single-sex residence halls, each with its own traditions, legacies, events,\
      \ and intramural sports teams. The university counts approximately 120,000 alumni,\
      \ considered among the strongest alumni networks among U.S. colleges.\n\nNotre\
      \ Dame rose to national prominence in the early 1900s for its Fighting Irish\
      \ football team under the guidance of legendary coach Knute Rockne. The university's\
      \ athletic teams are members of the NCAA Division I and are known collectively\
      \ as the Fighting Irish. The football team, an Independent with no conference\
      \ affiliation, has accumulated eleven consensus national championships, seven\
      \ Heisman Trophy winners, 62 members in the College Football Hall of Fame, 13\
      \ members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and is one of the most famed and\
      \ successful college football teams in history. Other ND sport teams, chiefly\
      \ in the Atlantic Coast Conference, have accumulated 16 national championships.\
      \ The Notre Dame Victory March is often regarded as the most famous and recognizable\
      \ collegiate fight song.\n\nStarted as a small all-male institution in 1842\
      \ and charter in 1844, Notre Dame reached international fame at the beginning\
      \ of the 20th century. Major improvements to the university occurred during\
      \ the administration of the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh between 1952 and 1987 as\
      \ Hesburgh's administration greatly increased the university's resources, academic\
      \ programs, and reputation and first enrolled women undergraduates in 1972.\
      \ Ever since, the University has seen steady growth, and under the leadership\
      \ of the next two presidents, Rev. Malloy and Rev. Jenkins, many infrastructure\
      \ and research expansions have been completed.\n\nIn 1842, the Bishop of Vincennes,\
      \ Célestine Guynemer de la Hailandière, offered land to Father Edward Sorin\
      \ of the Congregation of Holy Cross, on the condition that he build a college\
      \ in two years. Fr. Sorin arrived on the site with eight Holy Cross brothers\
      \ from France and Ireland on November 26, 1842, and began the school using Father\
      \ Stephen Badin's old log chapel. He soon erected additional buildings, including\
      \ the Old College, the first church, and the first main building. They immediately\
      \ acquired two students and set about building additions to the campus.\n\n\
      Notre Dame began as a primary and secondary school, but soon received its official\
      \ college charter from the Indiana General Assembly on January 15, 1844. Under\
      \ the charter the school is officially named the University of Notre Dame du\
      \ Lac (University of Our Lady of the Lake). Because the university was originally\
      \ only for male students, the female-only Saint Mary's College was founded by\
      \ the Sisters of the Holy Cross near Notre Dame in 1844.\n\nThe first degrees\
      \ from the college were awarded in 1849. The university was expanded with new\
      \ buildings to accommodate more students and faculty. With each new president,\
      \ new academic programs were offered and new buildings built to accommodate\
      \ them. The original Main Building built by Fr. Sorin just after he arrived\
      \ was replaced by a larger \"Main Building\" in 1865, which housed the university's\
      \ administration, classrooms, and dormitories. Beginning in 1873, a library\
      \ collection was started by Father Lemonnier, housed in the Main Building, and\
      \ by 1879 it had grown to ten thousand volumes. \n\nThis Main Building, and\
      \ the library collection, was entirely destroyed by a fire in April 1879; school\
      \ closed immediately and students were sent home. The university founder, Fr.\
      \ Sorin, and the president at the time, the Rev. William Corby, immediately\
      \ planned for the rebuilding of the structure that had housed virtually the\
      \ entire University. Construction was started on May 17, and by the incredible\
      \ zeal of administrator and workers the building was completed before the fall\
      \ semester of 1879. The library collection was also rebuilt and stayed housed\
      \ in the new Main Building for years afterwards. Around the time of the fire,\
      \ a music hall was opened. Known as Washington Hall, it hosted plays and musical\
      \ acts put on by the school. By 1880, a science program was established at the\
      \ university, and a Science Hall (today LaFortune Student Center) was built\
      \ in 1883. The hall housed multiple classrooms and science labs needed for early\
      \ research at the university.\n\nBy 1890, individual residence halls were built\
      \ to house the increasing number of students.\nWilliam J. Hoynes was dean of\
      \ the law school 1883–1919, and when its new building was opened shortly after\
      \ his death it was renamed in his honor. The Rev. John Zahm C.S.C. became the\
      \ Holy Cross Provincial for the United States (1896–1906), with overall supervision\
      \ of the university. He tried to modernize and expand Notre Dame, erecting buildings\
      \ and adding to the campus art gallery and library, and amassing what became\
      \ a famous Dante collection. His term was not renewed by the Congregation because\
      \ of fears he had expanded Notre Dame too quickly and had run the Holy Cross\
      \ order into serious debt.\n\nIn 1919 Father James Burns became president of\
      \ Notre Dame, and in three years he produced an academic revolution that brought\
      \ the school up to national standards by adopting the elective system and moving\
      \ away from the university's traditional scholastic and classical emphasis.\
      \ By contrast, the Jesuit colleges, bastions of academic conservatism, were\
      \ reluctant to move to a system of electives; for this reason, their graduates\
      \ were shut out of Harvard Law School. Notre Dame continued to grow over the\
      \ years, adding more colleges, programs, and sports teams. By 1921, with the\
      \ addition of the College of Commerce, Notre Dame had grown from a small college\
      \ to a university with five colleges and a professional law school. The university\
      \ continued to expand and add new residence halls and buildings with each subsequent\
      \ president.\n\nOne of the main driving forces in the growth of the University\
      \ was its football team, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Knute Rockne became\
      \ head coach in 1918. Under Rockne, the Irish would post a record of 105 wins,\
      \ 12 losses, and five ties. During his 13 years the Irish won three national\
      \ championships, had five undefeated seasons, won the Rose Bowl in 1925, and\
      \ produced players such as George Gipp and the \"Four Horsemen\". Knute Rockne\
      \ has the highest winning percentage (.881) in NCAA Division I/FBS football\
      \ history. Rockne's offenses employed the Notre Dame Box and his defenses ran\
      \ a 7–2–2 scheme. The last game Rockne coached was on December 14, 1930, when\
      \ he led a group of Notre Dame all-stars against the New York Giants in New\
      \ York City.\n\nThe success of its football team made Notre Dame a household\
      \ name. The success of Notre Dame reflected rising status of Irish Americans\
      \ and Catholics in the 1920s. Catholics rallied up around the team and listened\
      \ to the games on the radio, especially when it knocked off the schools that\
      \ symbolized the Protestant establishment in America—Harvard, Yale, Princeton,\
      \ and Army. Yet this role as high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism\
      \ made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism. The most remarkable episode of\
      \ violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan, a\
      \ white supremacist and anti-catholic movement, in 1924. Nativism and anti-Catholicism,\
      \ especially when directed towards immigrants, were cornerstones of the KKK's\
      \ rhetoric, and Notre Dame was seen as a symbol of the threat posed by the Catholic\
      \ Church. The Klan decided to have a week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes\
      \ with the student body started on March 17, when students, aware of the anti-Catholic\
      \ animosity, blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South\
      \ Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia. On May 19 thousands of\
      \ students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college\
      \ president Fr. Matthew Walsh prevented any further clashes. The next day, football\
      \ coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey\
      \ the college president and refrain from further violence. A few days later\
      \ the Klavern broke up, but the hostility shown by the students was an omen\
      \ and a contribution to the downfall of the KKK in Indiana.\nHoly Cross Father\
      \ John Francis O'Hara was elected vice president in 1933 and president of Notre\
      \ Dame in 1934. During his tenure at Notre Dame, he brought numerous refugee\
      \ intellectuals to campus; he selected Frank H. Spearman, Jeremiah D. M. Ford,\
      \ Irvin Abell, and Josephine Brownson for the Laetare Medal, instituted in 1883.\
      \ O'Hara strongly believed that the Fighting Irish football team could be an\
      \ effective means to \"acquaint the public with the ideals that dominate\" Notre\
      \ Dame. He wrote, \"Notre Dame football is a spiritual service because it is\
      \ played for the honor and glory of God and of his Blessed Mother. When St.\
      \ Paul said: 'Whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all for\
      \ the glory of God,' he included football.\"\n\nThe Rev. John J. Cavanaugh,\
      \ C.S.C. served as president from 1946 to 1952. Cavanaugh's legacy at Notre\
      \ Dame in the post-war years was devoted to raising academic standards and reshaping\
      \ the university administration to suit it to an enlarged educational mission\
      \ and an expanded student body and stressing advanced studies and research at\
      \ a time when Notre Dame quadrupled in student census, undergraduate enrollment\
      \ increased by more than half, and graduate student enrollment grew fivefold.\
      \ Cavanaugh also established the Lobund Institute for Animal Studies and Notre\
      \ Dame's Medieval Institute. Cavanaugh also presided over the construction of\
      \ the Nieuwland Science Hall, Fisher Hall, and the Morris Inn, as well as the\
      \ Hall of Liberal Arts (now O'Shaughnessy Hall), made possible by a donation\
      \ from I.A. O'Shaughnessy, at the time the largest ever made to an American\
      \ Catholic university. He also established a system of advisory councils at\
      \ the university, which continue today and are vital to the university's governance\
      \ and development.\n\nThe Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, C.S.C., (1917–2015) served\
      \ as president for 35 years (1952–87) of dramatic transformations. In that time\
      \ the annual operating budget rose by a factor of 18 from $9.7 million to $176.6\
      \ million, and the endowment by a factor of 40 from $9 million to $350 million,\
      \ and research funding by a factor of 20 from $735,000 to $15 million. Enrollment\
      \ nearly doubled from 4,979 to 9,600, faculty more than doubled 389 to 950,\
      \ and degrees awarded annually doubled from 1,212 to 2,500.\n\nHesburgh is also\
      \ credited with transforming the face of Notre Dame by making it a coeducational\
      \ institution. In the mid-1960s Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College developed\
      \ a co-exchange program whereby several hundred students took classes not offered\
      \ at their home institution, an arrangement that added undergraduate women to\
      \ a campus that already had a few women in the graduate schools. After extensive\
      \ debate, merging with St. Mary's was rejected, primarily because of the differential\
      \ in faculty qualifications and pay scales. \"In American college education,\"\
      \ explained the Rev. Charles E. Sheedy, C.S.C., Notre Dame's Dean of Arts and\
      \ Letters, \"certain features formerly considered advantageous and enviable\
      \ are now seen as anachronistic and out of place... In this environment of diversity,\
      \ the integration of the sexes is a normal and expected aspect, replacing separatism.\"\
      \ Thomas Blantz, C.S.C., Notre Dame's Vice President of Student Affairs, added\
      \ that coeducation \"opened up a whole other pool of very bright students.\"\
      \ Two of the male residence halls were converted for the newly admitted female\
      \ students that first year, while two others were converted for the next school\
      \ year. In 1971 Mary Ann Proctor became the first female undergraduate; she\
      \ transferred from St. Mary's College. In 1972, Angela Sienko, who earned a\
      \ bachelor's degree in marketing, became the first woman graduate from the university.\n\
      \nIn the 18 years under the presidency of Edward Malloy, C.S.C., (1987–2005),\
      \ there was a rapid growth in the school's reputation, faculty, and resources.\
      \ He increased the faculty by more than 500 professors; the academic quality\
      \ of the student body has improved dramatically, with the average SAT score\
      \ rising from 1240 to 1360; the number of minority students more than doubled;\
      \ the endowment grew from $350 million to more than $3 billion; the annual operating\
      \ budget rose from $177 million to more than $650 million; and annual research\
      \ funding improved from $15 million to more than $70 million. Notre Dame's most\
      \ recent (2014) capital campaign raised $2.014 billion, far exceeding its goal\
      \ of $767 million, and is the largest in the history of Catholic higher education\
      \ and the largest of any University without a medical school.\n\nSince 2005,\
      \ Notre Dame has been led by John I. Jenkins, C.S.C., the 17th president of\
      \ the university. Jenkins took over the position from Malloy on July 1, 2005.\
      \ In his inaugural address, Jenkins described his goals of making the university\
      \ a leader in research that recognizes ethics and building the connection between\
      \ faith and studies. During his tenure, Notre Dame has increased its endowment,\
      \ enlarged its student body, and undergone many construction projects on campus,\
      \ including Compton Family Ice Arena, a new architecture hall, additional residence\
      \ halls, and the Campus Crossroads, a $400m enhancement and expansion of Notre\
      \ Dame Stadium.\n\nNotre Dame's campus is located in Notre Dame, Indiana, an\
      \ unincorporated community in the Michiana area of Northern Indiana, north of\
      \ South Bend and four miles (6 km) from the Michigan state line.\nIn September\
      \ 2011, \"Travel+Leisure\" listed Notre Dame as having one of the most beautiful\
      \ college campuses in the United States. Today it lies on just south of the\
      \ Indiana Toll Road and includes 143 buildings located on quads throughout the\
      \ campus.\n\nDevelopment of the campus began in the spring of 1843, when Fr.\
      \ Sorin and some of his congregation built the \"Old College,\" a building used\
      \ for dormitories, a bakery, and a classroom. A year later, after an architect\
      \ arrived, a small \"Main Building\" was built allowing for the launch of the\
      \ college. The Main Building burned down in 1879, and it was immediately replaced\
      \ with the current one. It was topped with the Golden Dome, which today has\
      \ become Notre Dame's most distinguishable feature. Close to the Main Building\
      \ stands Washington Hall (University of Notre Dame), a theater that was built\
      \ in 1881 and has since then been used for theatrical and musical representation.\n\
      Because of its Catholic identity, a number of religious buildings stand on campus.\
      \ The Old College building has become one of two seminaries on campus run by\
      \ the Congregation of Holy Cross. The current Basilica of the Sacred Heart is\
      \ located on the spot of Fr. Sorin's original church, which became too small\
      \ for the growing college. It is built in French Revival style and it is decorated\
      \ by stained glass windows imported directly from France. The interior was painted\
      \ by Luigi Gregori, an Italian painter invited by Fr. Sorin to be artist in\
      \ residence. The Basilica also features a bell tower with a carillon. Inside\
      \ the church there are also sculptures by Ivan Mestrovic. The Grotto of Our\
      \ Lady of Lourdes, which was built in 1896, is a replica of the original in\
      \ Lourdes, France. It is very popular among students and alumni as a place of\
      \ prayer and meditation, and it is considered one of the most beloved spots\
      \ on campus.\n\nA Science Hall was built in 1883 under the direction of Fr.\
      \ Zahm, but in 1950 it was converted to a student union building and named LaFortune\
      \ Center, after Joseph LaFortune, an oil executive from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Commonly\
      \ known as \"LaFortune\" or \"LaFun,\" it is a 4-story building of that provides\
      \ the Notre Dame community with a meeting place for social, recreational, cultural,\
      \ and educational activities. LaFortune employs 35 part-time student staff and\
      \ 29 full-time non-student staff and has an annual budget of $1.2 million.\n\
      Many businesses, services, and divisions of The Office of Student Affairs are\
      \ found within. The building also houses restaurants from national restaurant\
      \ chains.\nSince the construction of its oldest buildings, the university's\
      \ physical plant has grown substantially. Over the years 29 residence halls\
      \ have been built to accommodate students and each has been constructed with\
      \ its own chapel. Many academic building were added together with a system of\
      \ libraries, the most prominent of which is the Theodore Hesburgh Library, built\
      \ in 1963 and today containing almost 4 million books. Since 2004, several buildings\
      \ have been added, including the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the Guglielmino\
      \ Complex, and the Jordan Hall of Science. Additionally, a new residence for\
      \ men, Duncan Hall, was begun on March 8, 2007, and began accepting residents\
      \ for the Fall 2008 semester. Ryan Hall was completed and began housing undergraduate\
      \ women in the fall of 2009. A new engineering building, Stinson-Remick Hall,\
      \ a new combination Center for Social Concerns/Institute for Church Life building,\
      \ Geddes Hall, and a law school addition have recently been completed as well.\
      \ Additionally the new hockey arena opened in the fall of 2011. The Stayer Center\
      \ for Executive Education, which houses the Mendoza College of Business Executive\
      \ Education Department opened in March 2013 just South of the Mendoza College\
      \ of Business building. Because of its long athletic tradition, the university\
      \ features also many building dedicated to sport. The most famous is Notre Dame\
      \ Stadium, home of the Fighting Irish football team; it has been renovated several\
      \ times and today it can hold more than 80 thousand people. Prominent venues\
      \ include also the Edmund P. Joyce Center, with indoor basketball and volleyball\
      \ courts, and the Compton Family Ice Arena, a two-rink facility dedicated to\
      \ hockey. Also, there are many outdoor fields, as the Frank Eck Stadium for\
      \ baseball.\nLegends of Notre Dame (commonly referred to as Legends) is a music\
      \ venue, public house, and restaurant located on the campus of the University\
      \ of Notre Dame, just south of Notre Dame Stadium. The former Alumni Senior\
      \ Club opened its doors the first weekend in September 2003 after a $3.5 million\
      \ renovation and transformed into the all-ages student hang-out that currently\
      \ exists. Legends is made up of two parts: The Restaurant and Alehouse and the\
      \ nightclub.\n\nThe University of Notre Dame has made being a sustainability\
      \ leader an integral part of its mission, creating the Office of Sustainability\
      \ in 2008 to achieve a number of goals in the areas of power generation, design\
      \ and construction, waste reduction, procurement, food services, transportation,\
      \ and water.<ref name=\"About the Office//Office of Sustainability//University\

      \ Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2010, University of Notre Dame\
      \ received a \"B\" grade. The university also houses the Kellog Institute for\
      \ International Peace Studies. Father Gustavo Gutierrez, the founder of Liberation\
      \ Theology is a current faculty member.\n\nThe university owns several centers\
      \ around the world used for international studies and research, conferences\
      \ abroad, and alumni support.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the five Global Getaways,\
      \ the University also holds a presence in Chicago where it owns the Santa Fe\
      \ Building (Chicago).\n\nThe university of Notre Dame is under the leadership\
      \ of the president, who is a priest of the Congregation of Holy Cross. The first\
      \ president was Fr. Edward Sorin and the current president is Fr. John I. Jenkins.\
      \ As of 2016, the provost of the university, who oversees academic functions,\
      \ is Thomas Burish.\nUntil 1967 Notre Dame had been governed directly by the\
      \ Congregation, but under the presidency of the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh two groups,\
      \ the Board of Fellows and the Board of Trustees were established to govern\
      \ the University. The Fellows are a group of six Holy Cross religious and six\
      \ lay members who have final say over the operation of the university. The Fellows\
      \ vote on potential trustees and sign off on all major decisions by that body.\
      \ The Trustees elect the president and provide general guidance and governance\
      \ to the university.\n\nNotre Dame's financial endowment was started in the\
      \ early 1920s by university president James Burns, and increased to US$7 million\
      \ by 1952 when Hesburgh became president. By the 1980s it reached $150 million,\
      \ and in 2000, it returned a record 57.9% investment. For the 2007 fiscal year,\
      \ the endowment had grown to approximately $6.5 billion, putting the university\
      \ in the top-15 largest endowments in the country. As of September 2015, Notre\
      \ Dame's endowment was valued over $10 billion.\n\nAs of fall 2014, Notre Dame\
      \ had 12,292 students and employed 1,126 full-time faculty members and another\
      \ 190 part-time members to give a student/faculty ratio of 8:1.\n\n\nAll of\
      \ Notre Dame's undergraduate students are a part of one of the five undergraduate\
      \ colleges at the school or are in the \"First Year of Studies program\".\n\
      The First Year of Studies program was established in 1962 to guide incoming\
      \ freshmen in their first year at the school before they have declared a major.\
      \ Each student is given an academic advisor from the program who helps them\
      \ to choose classes that give them exposure to any major in which they are interested.\
      \ The program also includes a Learning Resource Center which provides time management,\
      \ collaborative learning, and subject tutoring. This program has been recognized\
      \ previously, by \"U.S. News & World Report\", as outstanding. The program is\
      \ designed to encourage intellectual and academic achievement and innovation\
      \ among first year students. It includes programs such as FY advising, the Dean's\
      \ A list, the Renaissance circle, NDignite, the First year Urban challenge and\
      \ more.\n\nEach admissions cycle, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions selects\
      \ a small number of students for the Glynn Family Honors Program, which grants\
      \ top students within the College of Arts and Letters and the College of Science\
      \ access to smaller class sizes taught by distinguished faculty, endowed funding\
      \ for independent research, and dedicated advising faculty and staff.\n\nThe\
      \ university first offered graduate degrees, in the form of a Master of Arts\
      \ (MA), in the 1854–1855 academic year. The program expanded to include Master\
      \ of Laws (LL.M.) and Master of Civil Engineering in its early stages of growth,\
      \ before a formal graduate school education was developed with a thesis not\
      \ required to receive the degrees. This changed in 1924 with formal requirements\
      \ developed for graduate degrees, including offering Doctorate (PhD) degrees.\n\
      \nIn 2014, Notre Dame announced plans to establish the \"Donald R. Keough School\
      \ of Global Affairs\", a professional school focused on the study of global\
      \ government, human rights, and other areas of global social and political policy.\
      \ The creation of the school is funded by a $50 million gift from Donald Keough\
      \ and Marilyn Keough and will be housed in Jenkins Hall on Debartolo Quad. The\
      \ school is scheduled to open in August 2017.\n\nThe library system of the university\
      \ is divided between the main library and each of the colleges and schools.\
      \ The main building is the 14-story Theodore M. Hesburgh Library, completed\
      \ in 1963, which is the third building to house the main collection of books.\
      \ The front of the library is adorned with the Word of Life mural designed by\
      \ artist Millard Sheets. This mural is popularly known as \"Touchdown Jesus\"\
      \ because of its proximity to Notre Dame Stadium and Jesus' arms appearing to\
      \ make the signal for a touchdown.\n\nThe library system also includes branch\
      \ libraries for Architecture, Chemistry and Physics, Engineering, Law, and Mathematics\
      \ as well as information centers in the Mendoza College of Business, the Kellogg\
      \ Institute for International Studies, the Joan B. Kroc Institute for International\
      \ Peace Studies, and a slide library in O'Shaughnessy Hall. A theology library\
      \ was also opened in fall of 2015. Located on the first floor of Stanford Hall,\
      \ it is the first branch of the library system to be housed in a dorm room.\
      \ The library system holds over three million volumes, was the single largest\
      \ university library in the world upon its completion, and remains one of the\
      \ 100 largest libraries in the country.\n\nNotre Dame is known for its competitive\
      \ admissions, with the incoming class enrolling in fall 2016 admitting 3,655\
      \ from a pool of 19,505 (18.7%). The academic profile of the enrolled class\
      \ continues to rate among the top 10 to 15 in the nation for national research\
      \ universities. Of the most recent class, the Class of 2020, 48% were in the\
      \ top 1% of their high school, and 94% were in the top 10%. The median SAT score\
      \ was 1510 and the median ACt score was 34. The university practices a non-restrictive\
      \ early action policy that allows admitted students to consider admission to\
      \ Notre Dame as well as any other colleges to which they were accepted. 1,400\
      \ of the 3,577 (39.1%) were admitted under the early action plan. Admitted students\
      \ came from 1,311 high schools and the average student traveled more than 750\
      \ miles to Notre Dame, making it arguably the most representative university\
      \ in the United States. While all entering students begin in the College of\
      \ the First Year of Studies, 25% have indicated they plan to study in the liberal\
      \ arts or social sciences, 24% in engineering, 24% in business, 24% in science,\

      \ teaching and 15th overall among \"national universities\" in the United States\
      \ in \"U.S. News & World Report\"s \"Best Colleges 2016\". In 2014, \"USA Today\"\

      \ highest participation percentage in the nation, with 57.6% of students choosing\
      \ to study abroad in 17 countries. According to PayScale, undergraduate alumni\
      \ of University of Notre Dame have a mid-career median salary $110,000, making\
      \ it the 24th highest among colleges and universities in the United States.\
      \ The median starting salary of $55,300 ranked 58th in the same peer group.\n\
      \nNamed by \"Newsweek\" as one of the \"25 New Ivies,\" it is also an Oak Ridge\
      \ Associated University.\n\nFather Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. was Director of the\
      \ Science Museum and the Library and Professor of Chemistry and Physics until\
      \ 1874. Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress\
      \ were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed\
      \ by the Church. One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm who\
      \ was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and\
      \ by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active\
      \ in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to\
      \ contemporary intellectual issues. His book \"Evolution and Dogma\" (1896)\
      \ defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover,\
      \ that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something\
      \ like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's\
      \ censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt\
      \ embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.\n\nIn 1882, Albert Zahm\
      \ (John Zahm's brother) built an early wind tunnel used to compare lift to drag\
      \ of aeronautical models. Around 1899, Professor Jerome Green became the first\
      \ American to send a wireless message. In 1931, Father Julius Nieuwland performed\
      \ early work on basic reactions that was used to create neoprene. Study of nuclear\
      \ physics at the university began with the building of a nuclear accelerator\
      \ in 1936, and continues now partly through a partnership in the Joint Institute\
      \ for Nuclear Astrophysics.\n\nThe Lobund Institute (Laboratory Of Biology University\
      \ of Notre Dame) grew out of pioneering research in germ-free-life which began\
      \ in 1928. This area of research originated in a question posed by Pasteur as\
      \ to whether animal life was possible without bacteria. Though others had taken\
      \ up this idea, their research was short lived and inconclusive. Lobund was\
      \ the first research organization to answer definitively, that such life is\
      \ possible and that it can be prolonged through generations. But the objective\
      \ was not merely to answer Pasteur's question but also to produce the germ free\
      \ animal as a new tool for biological and medical research. This objective was\
      \ reached and for years Lobund was a unique center for the study and production\
      \ of germ free animals and for their use in biological and medical investigations.\
      \ Today the work has spread to other universities. In the beginning it was under\
      \ the Department of Biology and a program leading to the master's degree accompanied\
      \ the research program. In the 1940s Lobund achieved independent status as a\
      \ purely research organization and in 1950 was raised to the status of an Institute.\
      \ In 1958 it was brought back into the Department of Biology as integral part\
      \ of that department, but with its own program leading to the degree of PhD\
      \ in Gnotobiotics.\nRichard T. Sullivan taught English from 1936 to 1974 and\
      \ published six novels, dozens of short stories, and various other efforts.\
      \ He was known as a regional writer and a Catholic spokesman.\n\nFrank O'Malley\
      \ was an English professor during the 1930s–1960s. Influenced by philosophers\
      \ Jacques Maritain, John U. Nef, and others, O'Malley developed a concept of\
      \ Christian philosophy that was a fundamental element in his thought. Through\
      \ his course \"Modern Catholic Writers\" O'Malley introduced generations of\
      \ undergraduates to Gabriel Marcel, Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh, Sigrid Undset,\
      \ Paul Claudel, and Gerard Manley Hopkins.\n\n\"The Review of Politics\" was\
      \ founded in 1939 by Waldemar Gurian, modeled after German Catholic journals.\
      \ It quickly emerged as part of an international Catholic intellectual revival,\
      \ offering an alternative vision to positivist philosophy. For 44 years, the\
      \ \"Review\" was edited by Gurian, Matthew Fitzsimons, Frederick Crosson, and\
      \ Thomas Stritch. Intellectual leaders included Gurian, Jacques Maritain, Frank\
      \ O'Malley, Leo Richard Ward, F. A. Hermens, and John U. Nef. It became a major\
      \ forum for political ideas and modern political concerns, especially from a\
      \ Catholic and scholastic tradition.\n\nKenneth Sayre has explored the history\
      \ of the Philosophy department. He stresses the abandonment of official Thomism\
      \ to the philosophical pluralism of the 1970s, with attention to the issue of\
      \ being Catholic. He pays special attention to the charismatic personalities\
      \ of Ernan McMullin and Ralph McInerny, key leaders of the department in the\
      \ 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe rise of Hitler and other dictators in the 1930s forced\
      \ numerous Catholic intellectuals to flee Europe; president John O'Hara brought\
      \ many to Notre Dame. From Germany came Anton-Hermann Chroust (1907–1982) in\
      \ classics and law, and Waldemar Gurian a German Catholic intellectual of Jewish\
      \ descent. Positivism dominated American intellectual life in the 1920s onward\
      \ but in marked contrast, Gurian received a German Catholic education and wrote\
      \ his doctoral dissertation under Max Scheler. Ivan Meštrović (1883–1962), a\
      \ renowned sculptor, brought Croatian culture to campus, 1955–62. Yves Simon\
      \ (1903–61), brought to ND in the 1940s the insights of French studies in the\
      \ Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition of philosophy; his own teacher Jacques Maritain\
      \ (1882–73) was a frequent visitor to campus.\n\nThe exiles developed a distinctive\
      \ emphasis on the evils of totalitarianism. For example, the political science\
      \ courses of Gerhart Niemeyer (1907–97) discussed communist ideology and were\
      \ particularly accessible to his students. He came to ND in 1955, and was a\
      \ frequent contributor to the \"National Review\" and other conservative magazines.\n\
      \n research continued in many fields. The university president, John Jenkins,\
      \ described his hope that Notre Dame would become \"one of the pre–eminent research\
      \ institutions in the world\" in his inaugural address. The university has many\
      \ multi-disciplinary institutes devoted to research in varying fields, including\
      \ the Medieval Institute, the Kellogg Institute for International Studies, the\
      \ Kroc Institute for International Peace studies, and the Center for Social\
      \ Concerns. Recent research includes work on family conflict and child development,\
      \ genome mapping, the increasing trade deficit of the United States with China,\
      \ studies in fluid mechanics, computational science and engineering, and marketing\
      \ trends on the Internet. As of 2013, the university is home to the Notre Dame\
      \ Global Adaptation Index which ranks countries annually based on how vulnerable\
      \ they are to climate change and how prepared they are to adapt.\n\nIn 2014\
      \ the Notre Dame student body consisted of 12,179 students, with 8,448 undergraduates,\
      \ 2,138 graduate and professional and 1,593 professional (Law, M.Div., Business,\
      \ M.Ed.) students. Around 21–24% of students are children of alumni, and although\
      \ 37% of students come from the Midwestern United States, the student body represents\
      \ all 50 states and 100 countries. 32% of students are U.S. students of color\
      \ or international citizens. \"The Princeton Review\" ranked the school as the\
      \ fifth highest 'dream school' for parents to send their children. The \"Princeton\
      \ Review\" ranked Notre Dame as the ninth highest. It has also been commended\
      \ by some diversity oriented publications; \"Hispanic Magazine\" in 2004 ranked\
      \ the university ninth on its list of the top–25 colleges for Latinos, and \"\
      The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education\" recognized the university in 2006\
      \ for raising enrollment of African-American students. With 6,000 participants,\
      \ the university's intramural sports program was named in 2004 by \"Sports Illustrated\"\
      \ as the best program in the country, while in 2007 \"The Princeton Review\"\
      \ named it as the top school where \"Everyone Plays Intramural Sports.\" The\
      \ annual Bookstore Basketball tournament is the largest outdoor five-on-five\
      \ tournament in the world with over 700 teams participating each year, while\
      \ the Notre Dame Men's Boxing Club hosts the annual Bengal Bouts tournament\
      \ that raises money for the Holy Cross Missions in Bangladesh.\n\nThe strictly\
      \ measured federal graduation rate for athletes was 90% for freshmen who entered\
      \ between 2005 and 2008. This is the second highest in the country.\n\nAbout\
      \ 80% of undergraduates and 20% of graduate students live on campus. The majority\
      \ of the graduate students on campus live in one of four graduate housing complexes\
      \ on campus, while all on-campus undergraduates live in one of the 31 residence\
      \ halls. Because of the religious affiliation of the university, all residence\
      \ halls are single-sex, with 16 male dorms and 15 female dorms. The university\
      \ maintains a visiting policy (known as parietal hours) for those students who\
      \ live in dormitories, specifying times when members of the opposite sex are\
      \ allowed to visit other students' dorm rooms; however, all residence halls\
      \ have 24-hour social spaces for students regardless of gender. Many residence\
      \ halls have at least one nun and/or priest as a resident. There are no traditional\
      \ social fraternities or sororities at the university, but a majority of students\
      \ live in the same residence hall for all four years. Some intramural sports\
      \ are based on residence hall teams, where the university offers the only non-military\
      \ academy program of full-contact intramural American football. At the end of\
      \ the intramural season, the championship game is played on the field in Notre\
      \ Dame Stadium.\n\nThe university is affiliated with the Congregation of Holy\
      \ Cross (Latin: \"Congregatio a Sancta Cruce\", abbreviated postnominals: \"\
      CSC\"). While religious affiliation is not a criterion for admission, more than\
      \ 93% of students identify as Christian, with over 80% of the total being Catholic.\
      \ Collectively, Catholic Mass is celebrated over 100 times per week on campus,\
      \ and a large campus ministry program provides for the faith needs of the community.\
      \ There are multitudes of religious statues and artwork around campus, most\
      \ prominent of which are the statue of Mary on the Main Building, the Notre\
      \ Dame Grotto, and the Word of Life mural on Hesburgh Library depicting Christ\
      \ as a teacher. Additionally, every classroom displays a crucifix. There are\
      \ many religious clubs (Catholic and non-Catholic) at the school, including\
      \ Council #1477 of the Knights of Columbus (KOC), Baptist Collegiate Ministry\
      \ (BCM), Jewish Club, Muslim Student Association, Orthodox Christian Fellowship,\
      \ The Mormon Club, and many more. The Notre Dame KofC are known for being the\
      \ first collegiate council of KofC, operating a charitable concession stand\
      \ during every home football game and owning their own building on campus which\
      \ can be used as a cigar lounge. Fifty-seven chapels are located throughout\
      \ the campus.\n\nArchitecturally, the school has a Catholic character. Atop\
      \ the Main Building's gold dome is a golden statue of the Virgin Mary. Immediately\
      \ in front of the Main Building and facing it, is a copper statue of Christ\
      \ with arms upraised with the legend \"\"Venite Ad Me Omnes\"\" (Come to me,\
      \ all ye). Next to the Main Building is the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Immediately\
      \ behind the basilica is the Grotto, a Marian place of prayer and reflection.\
      \ It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, France where the Virgin Mary reputedly\
      \ appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 1858. At the end of the main drive\
      \ (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and the Gold Dome),\
      \ is a simple, modern stone statue of Mary.\n\nThe university is the major seat\
      \ of the Congregation of Holy Cross (albeit not its official headquarters, which\
      \ are in Rome). Its main seminary, Moreau Seminary, is located on the campus\
      \ across St. Joseph lake from the Main Building. Old College, the oldest building\
      \ on campus and located near the shore of St. Mary lake, houses undergraduate\
      \ seminarians. Retired priests and brothers reside in Fatima House (a former\
      \ retreat center), Holy Cross House, as well as Columba Hall near the Grotto.\n\
      \nThe university has a highly regarded theology program, both undergraduate\
      \ and graduate, with many scholars, including Lawrence Cunningham, John Cavadini,\
      \ and Gary Anderson. The chair of the department, John Cavadini, was appointed\
      \ to the International Theological Commission by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010;\
      \ Prof. Brian E. Daley, SJ, received the Ratzinger Prize in Theology in 2012.\n\
      As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media\
      \ outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio\
      \ and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page\
      \ journal in September 1876, the \"Scholastic\" magazine is issued twice monthly\
      \ and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United\
      \ States. The other magazine, \"The Juggler\", is released twice a year and\
      \ focuses on student literature and artwork. The \"Dome\" yearbook is published\
      \ annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with \"The Observer\"\
      \ published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed\
      \ by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike \"Scholastic\"\
      \ and \"The Dome,\" \"The Observer\" is an independent publication and does\
      \ not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University.\
      \ In 1987, when some students believed that \"The Observer\" began to show a\
      \ conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, \"Common Sense\" was published. Likewise,\
      \ in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias,\
      \ the conservative paper \"Irish Rover\" went into production. Neither paper\
      \ is published as often as \"The Observer\"; however, all three are distributed\
      \ to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political\
      \ science research, \"Beyond Politics\", made its debut.\n\nThe television station,\
      \ NDtv, grew from one show in 2002 to a full 24-hour channel with original programming\
      \ by September 2006. WSND-FM serves the student body and larger South Bend community\
      \ at 88.9 FM, offering students a chance to become involved in bringing classical\
      \ music, fine arts and educational programming, and alternative rock to the\
      \ airwaves. Another radio station, WVFI, began as a partner of WSND-FM. More\
      \ recently, however, WVFI has been airing independently and is streamed on the\
      \ Internet.\n\nThe first phase of Eddy Street Commons, a $215 million development\
      \ located adjacent to the University of Notre Dame campus and funded by the\
      \ university, broke ground on June 3, 2008. The Eddy Street Commons drew union\
      \ protests when workers hired by the City of South Bend to construct the public\
      \ parking garage picketed the private work site after a contractor hired non-union\
      \ workers. The developer, Kite Realty out of Indianapolis, has made agreements\
      \ with major national chains rather than local businesses, a move that has led\
      \ to criticism from alumni and students.\n\nNotre Dame teams are known as the\
      \ Fighting Irish. They compete as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic\
      \ Association (NCAA) Division I, primarily competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference\
      \ (ACC) for all sports since the 2013–14 school year. The Fighting Irish previously\
      \ competed in the Horizon League from 1982–83 to 1985–86, and again from 1987–88\
      \ to 1994–95, and then in the Big East Conference through 2012–13. Men's sports\
      \ include baseball, basketball, crew, cross country, fencing, football, golf,\
      \ ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis and track & field;\
      \ while women's sports include basketball, cross country, fencing, golf, lacrosse,\
      \ rowing, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, and\
      \ volleyball. The football team competes as an Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS)\
      \ Independent since its inception in 1887. Both fencing teams compete in the\
      \ Midwest Fencing Conference, and the men's ice hockey team competes in Hockey\
      \ East.\n\nNotre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except\
      \ football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference\
      \ realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish\
      \ left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in\
      \ the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed\
      \ to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish\
      \ were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision\
      \ to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated\
      \ in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate\
      \ Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey\
      \ team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced\
      \ it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school\
      \ year.\nThere are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker\
      \ but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with\
      \ respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace\
      \ in his \"New York Daily News\" columns. The official colors of Notre Dame\
      \ are navy blue and gold which are worn in competition by its athletic teams.\
      \ In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname.\
      \ The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by\
      \ Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket\
      \ schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured\
      \ on the cover of \"Time\" in November 1964 and gained national exposure.\n\n\
      On July 1, 2014, the University of Notre Dame and Under Armour reached an agreement\
      \ in which Under Armour will provide uniforms, apparel,equipment, and monetary\
      \ compensation to Notre Dame for 10 years. This contract, worth almost $100\
      \ million, is the most lucrative in the history of the NCAA.\nThe university\
      \ marching band plays at home games for most of the sports. The band, which\
      \ began in 1846 and has a claim as the oldest university band in continuous\
      \ existence in the United States, was honored by the National Music Council\
      \ as a \"Landmark of American Music\" during the United States Bicentennial.\
      \ The band regularly plays the school's fight song the \"Notre Dame Victory\
      \ March\", which was named as the most played and most famous fight song by\
      \ Northern Illinois Professor William Studwell. According to \"College Fight\
      \ Songs: An Annotated Anthology\" published in 1998, the \"Notre Dame Victory\
      \ March\" ranks as the greatest fight song of all time.\n\nAccording to some\
      \ analysts without direct connection to the university or its athletic department,\
      \ Notre Dame promotes Muscular Christianity through its athletic programs.\n\
      \nThe Notre Dame football team has a long history, first beginning when the\
      \ Michigan Wolverines football team brought football to Notre Dame in 1887 and\
      \ played against a group of students. In the long history since then, 13 Fighting\
      \ Irish teams have won consensus national championships (although the university\
      \ only claims 11), along with another nine teams being named national champion\
      \ by at least one source. Additionally, the program has the most members in\
      \ the College Football Hall of Fame, is tied with Ohio State University with\
      \ the most Heisman Trophies won, and have the highest winning percentage in\
      \ NCAA history. With the long history, Notre Dame has accumulated many rivals,\
      \ and its annual game against USC for the Jeweled Shillelagh has been named\
      \ by some as one of the most important in college football and is often called\
      \ the greatest intersectional rivalry in college football in the country.\n\n\
      George Gipp was the school's legendary football player during 1916–20. He played\
      \ semiprofessional baseball and smoked, drank, and gambled when not playing\
      \ sports. He was also humble, generous to the needy, and a man of integrity.\
      \ It was in 1928 that famed coach Knute Rockne used his final conversation with\
      \ the dying Gipp to inspire the Notre Dame team to beat the Army team and \"\
      win one for the Gipper.\" The 1940 film, \"Knute Rockne, All American\", starred\
      \ Pat O'Brien as Knute Rockne and Ronald Reagan as Gipp.\nThe team competes\
      \ in Notre Dame Stadium, an 80,795-seat stadium on campus. The current head\
      \ coach is Brian Kelly, hired from the University of Cincinnati on December\
      \ 11, 2009. Kelly's record in midway through his sixth season at Notre Dame\
      \ is 52–21. In 2012, Kelly's Fighting Irish squad went undefeated and played\
      \ in the BCS National Championship Game. Kelly succeeded Charlie Weis, who was\
      \ fired in November 2009 after five seasons. Although Weis led his team to two\
      \ Bowl Championship Series bowl games, his overall record was 35–27, mediocre\
      \ by Notre Dame standards, and the 2007 team had the most losses in school history.\
      \ The football team generates enough revenue to operate independently while\
      \ $22.1 million is retained from the team's profits for academic use. \"Forbes\"\
      \ named the team as the most valuable in college football, worth a total of\
      \ $101 million in 2007.\nFootball gameday traditions\nDuring home games, activities\
      \ occur all around campus and different dorms decorate their halls with a traditional\
      \ item (e.g., Zahm Hall's two-story banner). Traditional activities begin at\
      \ the stroke of midnight with the Drummers' Circle. This tradition involves\
      \ the drum line of the Band of the Fighting Irish and ushers in the rest of\
      \ the festivities that will continue the rest of the gameday Saturday. Later\
      \ that day, the trumpet section will play the Notre Dame Victory March and the\
      \ Notre Dame Alma Mater under the dome. The entire band will play a concert\
      \ at the steps of Bond Hall, from where they will march into Notre Dame Stadium,\
      \ leading fans and students alike across the campus to the game.\n\nAs of the\
      \ 2014–2015 season, the men's basketball team has over 1,898 wins, one of only\
      \ 8 schools with more wins, and have appeared in 28 NCAA tournaments. Former\
      \ player Austin Carr holds the record for most points scored in a single game\
      \ of the tournament with 61. Although the team has never won the NCAA Tournament,\
      \ they were named by the Helms Athletic Foundation as national champions twice.\
      \ The team has orchestrated a number of upsets of number one ranked teams, the\
      \ most notable of which was ending UCLA's record 88-game winning streak in 1974.\
      \ The team has beaten an additional eight number-one teams, and those nine wins\
      \ rank second, to UCLA's 10, all-time in wins against the top team. The team\
      \ plays in newly renovated Purcell Pavilion (within the Edmund P. Joyce Center),\
      \ which reopened for the beginning of the 2009–2010 season. The team is coached\
      \ by Mike Brey, who, as of the 2015–16 season, his fifteenth at Notre Dame,\
      \ has achieved a 356–177 record. In 2009 they were invited to the NIT, where\
      \ they advanced to the semifinals but were beaten by Penn State who went on\
      \ and beat Baylor in the championship. The 2010–11 team concluded its regular\
      \ season ranked number seven in the country, with a record of 25–5, Brey's fifth\
      \ straight 20-win season, and a second-place finish in the Big East. During\
      \ the 2014–15 season, the team went 32–6 and won the ACC conference tournament,\
      \ later advancing to the Elite 8, where the Fighting Irish lost on a missed\
      \ buzzer-beater against then undefeated Kentucky. Led by NBA draft picks Jerian\
      \ Grant and Pat Connaughton, the Fighting Irish beat the eventual national champion\
      \ Duke Blue Devils twice during the season. The 32 wins were the most by the\
      \ Fighting Irish team since 1908–09.\n\nNotre Dame has been successful in other\
      \ sports besides football, with an additional 14 national championships in various\
      \ sports. Three teams have won multiple national championships with the fencing\
      \ team leading them with seven, followed by the men's tennis and women's soccer\
      \ teams each with two. The men's cross country, men's golf, and women's basketball\
      \ teams have each won one in their histories.\n\nIn the first ten years that\
      \ Notre Dame competed in the Big East Conference its teams won a total of 64\
      \ championships. As of 2010, the women's swimming and diving team holds the\
      \ Big East record for consecutive conference championships in any sport with\
      \ 14 straight conference titles (1997–2010).\n\nThe Band of the Fighting Irish\
      \ is the oldest university band in continuous existence. It was formed in 1846.\
      \ The all-male Glee Club was formed in 1915. The Internationally recognized\
      \ \"Notre Dame Folk Choir\" was founded by Steven \"Cookie\" Warner in 1980.\n\
      \nThe \"Notre Dame Victory March\" is the fight song for the University of Notre\
      \ Dame. It was written by two brothers who were Notre Dame graduates. The Rev.\
      \ Michael J. Shea, a 1904 graduate, wrote the music, and his brother, John F.\
      \ Shea, who earned degrees in 1906 and 1908, wrote the original lyrics. The\
      \ lyrics were revised in the 1920s; it first appeared under the copyright of\
      \ the University of Notre Dame in 1928. The chorus is, \"Cheer cheer for old\
      \ Notre Dame, wake up the echos cheering her name. Send a volley cheer on high,\
      \ shake down the thunder from the sky! What though the odds be great or small,\
      \ old Notre Dame will win over all. While her loyal sons are marching, onward\
      \ to victory!\"\n\nThe chorus of the song is one of the most recognizable collegiate\
      \ fight songs in the United States, and was ranked first among fight songs by\
      \ Northern Illinois University Professor William Studwell, who remarked it was\
      \ \"more borrowed, more famous and, frankly, you just hear it more\".\n\nIn\
      \ the film \"Knute Rockne, All American\", Knute Rockne (played by Pat O'Brien)\
      \ delivers the famous \"Win one for the Gipper\" speech, at which point the\
      \ background music swells with the \"Notre Dame Victory March\". George Gipp\
      \ was played by Ronald Reagan, whose nickname \"The Gipper\" was derived from\
      \ this role. This scene was parodied in the movie \"Airplane!\" with the same\
      \ background music, only this time honoring George Zipp, one of Ted Striker's\
      \ former comrades. The song also was prominent in the movie \"Rudy\", with Sean\
      \ Astin as Daniel \"Rudy\" Ruettiger, who harbored dreams of playing football\
      \ at the University of Notre Dame despite significant obstacles.\n\nNotre Dame\
      \ alumni number near 120,000, and are members of 275 alumni clubs around the\
      \ world. Many alumni give yearly monetary support to the university, with a\
      \ school-record 53.2% giving some donation in 2006. Many buildings on campus\
      \ are named for those whose donations allowed their building, including residence\
      \ halls, classroom buildings, and the performing arts center.\n\nNotre Dame\
      \ alumni work in various fields. Alumni working in political fields include\
      \ state governors, members of the United States Congress, and former United\
      \ States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Notable alumni from the College\
      \ of Science are Eric F. Wieschaus, winner of the 1995 Nobel Prize in medicine,\
      \ and Philip Majerus, discoverer of the cardioprotective effects of aspirin.\
      \ A number of university heads are alumni, including Notre Dame's current president,\
      \ the Rev. John Jenkins. Additionally, many alumni are in the media, including\
      \ talk show hosts Regis Philbin and Phil Donahue, and television and radio personalities\
      \ such as Mike Golic and Hannah Storm. With the university having high-profile\
      \ sports teams itself, a number of alumni went on to become involved in athletics\
      \ outside the university, including professional baseball, basketball, football,\
      \ and ice hockey players, such as Joe Theismann, Joe Montana, Tim Brown, Ross\

    text: "\nThe University of Notre Dame du Lac (or simply Notre Dame ) is a Catholic\
      \ research university located adjacent to South Bend, Indiana, in the United\
      \ States. In French, \"Notre Dame du Lac\" means \"Our Lady of the Lake\" and\
      \ refers to the university's patron saint, the Virgin Mary. The main campus\
      \ covers in a suburban setting and it contains a number of recognizable landmarks,\
      \ such as the Golden Dome, the \"Word of Life\" mural (commonly known as Touchdown\
      \ Jesus), and the Basilica. The school was founded on November 26, 1842, by\
      \ Father Edward Sorin, CSC, who was also its first president, as an all-male\
      \ institution on land donated by the Bishop of Vincennes (Indiana). Today, many\
      \ Holy Cross priests continue to work for the university, including the president\
      \ of the university.\n\nNotre Dame is a large, four-year, highly residential\
      \ research university. It is consistently ranked among the top twenty universities\
      \ in the United States and as a major global university and is highly regarded\
      \ for its undergraduate education. Notre Dame is also ranked as one of the top\
      \ research universities and it has one of the largest endowments in the nation\
      \ with over $10 billion. Undergraduate students are organized into four colleges\
      \ (Arts and Letters, Science, Engineering, Business), and the Architecture School.\
      \ The latter is known for teaching New Classical Architecture and for awarding\
      \ the globally renowned annual Driehaus Architecture Prize.\n\nThe university\
      \ offers over 50 foreign study abroad yearlong programs and over 15 summer programs.\
      \ Notre Dame's graduate program has more than 50 master, doctoral and professional\
      \ degree programs offered by the five schools, with the addition of the Notre\
      \ Dame Law School and a MD-PhD program offered in combination with IU medical\
      \ School. It maintains a system of libraries, cultural venues, artistic and\
      \ scientific museums, including the Hesburgh Library and the Snite Museum of\
      \ Art. The university boasts one of the largest Navy ROTC programs in the nation.\
      \ Over 80% of the university's 8,000 undergraduates live on campus in one of\
      \ 29 single-sex residence halls, each with its own traditions, legacies, events,\
      \ and intramural sports teams. The university counts approximately 120,000 alumni,\
      \ considered among the strongest alumni networks among U.S. colleges.\n\nNotre\
      \ Dame rose to national prominence in the early 1900s for its Fighting Irish\
      \ football team under the guidance of legendary coach Knute Rockne. The university's\
      \ athletic teams are members of the NCAA Division I and are known collectively\
      \ as the Fighting Irish. The football team, an Independent with no conference\
      \ affiliation, has accumulated eleven consensus national championships, seven\
      \ Heisman Trophy winners, 62 members in the College Football Hall of Fame, 13\
      \ members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and is one of the most famed and\
      \ successful college football teams in history. Other ND sport teams, chiefly\
      \ in the Atlantic Coast Conference, have accumulated 16 national championships.\
      \ The Notre Dame Victory March is often regarded as the most famous and recognizable\
      \ collegiate fight song.\n\nStarted as a small all-male institution in 1842\
      \ and charter in 1844, Notre Dame reached international fame at the beginning\
      \ of the 20th century. Major improvements to the university occurred during\
      \ the administration of the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh between 1952 and 1987 as\
      \ Hesburgh's administration greatly increased the university's resources, academic\
      \ programs, and reputation and first enrolled women undergraduates in 1972.\
      \ Ever since, the University has seen steady growth, and under the leadership\
      \ of the next two presidents, Rev. Malloy and Rev. Jenkins, many infrastructure\
      \ and research expansions have been completed.\n\nIn 1842, the Bishop of Vincennes,\
      \ Célestine Guynemer de la Hailandière, offered land to Father Edward Sorin\
      \ of the Congregation of Holy Cross, on the condition that he build a college\
      \ in two years. Fr. Sorin arrived on the site with eight Holy Cross brothers\
      \ from France and Ireland on November 26, 1842, and began the school using Father\
      \ Stephen Badin's old log chapel. He soon erected additional buildings, including\
      \ the Old College, the first church, and the first main building. They immediately\
      \ acquired two students and set about building additions to the campus.\n\n\
      Notre Dame began as a primary and secondary school, but soon received its official\
      \ college charter from the Indiana General Assembly on January 15, 1844. Under\
      \ the charter the school is officially named the University of Notre Dame du\
      \ Lac (University of Our Lady of the Lake). Because the university was originally\
      \ only for male students, the female-only Saint Mary's College was founded by\
      \ the Sisters of the Holy Cross near Notre Dame in 1844.\n\nThe first degrees\
      \ from the college were awarded in 1849. The university was expanded with new\
      \ buildings to accommodate more students and faculty. With each new president,\
      \ new academic programs were offered and new buildings built to accommodate\
      \ them. The original Main Building built by Fr. Sorin just after he arrived\
      \ was replaced by a larger \"Main Building\" in 1865, which housed the university's\
      \ administration, classrooms, and dormitories. Beginning in 1873, a library\
      \ collection was started by Father Lemonnier, housed in the Main Building, and\
      \ by 1879 it had grown to ten thousand volumes. \n\nThis Main Building, and\
      \ the library collection, was entirely destroyed by a fire in April 1879; school\
      \ closed immediately and students were sent home. The university founder, Fr.\
      \ Sorin, and the president at the time, the Rev. William Corby, immediately\
      \ planned for the rebuilding of the structure that had housed virtually the\
      \ entire University. Construction was started on May 17, and by the incredible\
      \ zeal of administrator and workers the building was completed before the fall\
      \ semester of 1879. The library collection was also rebuilt and stayed housed\
      \ in the new Main Building for years afterwards. Around the time of the fire,\
      \ a music hall was opened. Known as Washington Hall, it hosted plays and musical\
      \ acts put on by the school. By 1880, a science program was established at the\
      \ university, and a Science Hall (today LaFortune Student Center) was built\
      \ in 1883. The hall housed multiple classrooms and science labs needed for early\
      \ research at the university.\n\nBy 1890, individual residence halls were built\
      \ to house the increasing number of students.\nWilliam J. Hoynes was dean of\
      \ the law school 1883–1919, and when its new building was opened shortly after\
      \ his death it was renamed in his honor. The Rev. John Zahm C.S.C. became the\
      \ Holy Cross Provincial for the United States (1896–1906), with overall supervision\
      \ of the university. He tried to modernize and expand Notre Dame, erecting buildings\
      \ and adding to the campus art gallery and library, and amassing what became\
      \ a famous Dante collection. His term was not renewed by the Congregation because\
      \ of fears he had expanded Notre Dame too quickly and had run the Holy Cross\
      \ order into serious debt.\n\nIn 1919 Father James Burns became president of\
      \ Notre Dame, and in three years he produced an academic revolution that brought\
      \ the school up to national standards by adopting the elective system and moving\
      \ away from the university's traditional scholastic and classical emphasis.\
      \ By contrast, the Jesuit colleges, bastions of academic conservatism, were\
      \ reluctant to move to a system of electives; for this reason, their graduates\
      \ were shut out of Harvard Law School. Notre Dame continued to grow over the\
      \ years, adding more colleges, programs, and sports teams. By 1921, with the\
      \ addition of the College of Commerce, Notre Dame had grown from a small college\
      \ to a university with five colleges and a professional law school. The university\
      \ continued to expand and add new residence halls and buildings with each subsequent\
      \ president.\n\nOne of the main driving forces in the growth of the University\
      \ was its football team, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Knute Rockne became\
      \ head coach in 1918. Under Rockne, the Irish would post a record of 105 wins,\
      \ 12 losses, and five ties. During his 13 years the Irish won three national\
      \ championships, had five undefeated seasons, won the Rose Bowl in 1925, and\
      \ produced players such as George Gipp and the \"Four Horsemen\". Knute Rockne\
      \ has the highest winning percentage (.881) in NCAA Division I/FBS football\
      \ history. Rockne's offenses employed the Notre Dame Box and his defenses ran\
      \ a 7–2–2 scheme. The last game Rockne coached was on December 14, 1930, when\
      \ he led a group of Notre Dame all-stars against the New York Giants in New\
      \ York City.\n\nThe success of its football team made Notre Dame a household\
      \ name. The success of Notre Dame reflected rising status of Irish Americans\
      \ and Catholics in the 1920s. Catholics rallied up around the team and listened\
      \ to the games on the radio, especially when it knocked off the schools that\
      \ symbolized the Protestant establishment in America—Harvard, Yale, Princeton,\
      \ and Army. Yet this role as high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism\
      \ made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism. The most remarkable episode of\
      \ violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan, a\
      \ white supremacist and anti-catholic movement, in 1924. Nativism and anti-Catholicism,\
      \ especially when directed towards immigrants, were cornerstones of the KKK's\
      \ rhetoric, and Notre Dame was seen as a symbol of the threat posed by the Catholic\
      \ Church. The Klan decided to have a week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes\
      \ with the student body started on March 17, when students, aware of the anti-Catholic\
      \ animosity, blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South\
      \ Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia. On May 19 thousands of\
      \ students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college\
      \ president Fr. Matthew Walsh prevented any further clashes. The next day, football\
      \ coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey\
      \ the college president and refrain from further violence. A few days later\
      \ the Klavern broke up, but the hostility shown by the students was an omen\
      \ and a contribution to the downfall of the KKK in Indiana.\nHoly Cross Father\
      \ John Francis O'Hara was elected vice president in 1933 and president of Notre\
      \ Dame in 1934. During his tenure at Notre Dame, he brought numerous refugee\
      \ intellectuals to campus; he selected Frank H. Spearman, Jeremiah D. M. Ford,\
      \ Irvin Abell, and Josephine Brownson for the Laetare Medal, instituted in 1883.\
      \ O'Hara strongly believed that the Fighting Irish football team could be an\
      \ effective means to \"acquaint the public with the ideals that dominate\" Notre\
      \ Dame. He wrote, \"Notre Dame football is a spiritual service because it is\
      \ played for the honor and glory of God and of his Blessed Mother. When St.\
      \ Paul said: 'Whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all for\
      \ the glory of God,' he included football.\"\n\nThe Rev. John J. Cavanaugh,\
      \ C.S.C. served as president from 1946 to 1952. Cavanaugh's legacy at Notre\
      \ Dame in the post-war years was devoted to raising academic standards and reshaping\
      \ the university administration to suit it to an enlarged educational mission\
      \ and an expanded student body and stressing advanced studies and research at\
      \ a time when Notre Dame quadrupled in student census, undergraduate enrollment\
      \ increased by more than half, and graduate student enrollment grew fivefold.\
      \ Cavanaugh also established the Lobund Institute for Animal Studies and Notre\
      \ Dame's Medieval Institute. Cavanaugh also presided over the construction of\
      \ the Nieuwland Science Hall, Fisher Hall, and the Morris Inn, as well as the\
      \ Hall of Liberal Arts (now O'Shaughnessy Hall), made possible by a donation\
      \ from I.A. O'Shaughnessy, at the time the largest ever made to an American\
      \ Catholic university. He also established a system of advisory councils at\
      \ the university, which continue today and are vital to the university's governance\
      \ and development.\n\nThe Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, C.S.C., (1917–2015) served\
      \ as president for 35 years (1952–87) of dramatic transformations. In that time\
      \ the annual operating budget rose by a factor of 18 from $9.7 million to $176.6\
      \ million, and the endowment by a factor of 40 from $9 million to $350 million,\
      \ and research funding by a factor of 20 from $735,000 to $15 million. Enrollment\
      \ nearly doubled from 4,979 to 9,600, faculty more than doubled 389 to 950,\
      \ and degrees awarded annually doubled from 1,212 to 2,500.\n\nHesburgh is also\
      \ credited with transforming the face of Notre Dame by making it a coeducational\
      \ institution. In the mid-1960s Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College developed\
      \ a co-exchange program whereby several hundred students took classes not offered\
      \ at their home institution, an arrangement that added undergraduate women to\
      \ a campus that already had a few women in the graduate schools. After extensive\
      \ debate, merging with St. Mary's was rejected, primarily because of the differential\
      \ in faculty qualifications and pay scales. \"In American college education,\"\
      \ explained the Rev. Charles E. Sheedy, C.S.C., Notre Dame's Dean of Arts and\
      \ Letters, \"certain features formerly considered advantageous and enviable\
      \ are now seen as anachronistic and out of place... In this environment of diversity,\
      \ the integration of the sexes is a normal and expected aspect, replacing separatism.\"\
      \ Thomas Blantz, C.S.C., Notre Dame's Vice President of Student Affairs, added\
      \ that coeducation \"opened up a whole other pool of very bright students.\"\
      \ Two of the male residence halls were converted for the newly admitted female\
      \ students that first year, while two others were converted for the next school\
      \ year. In 1971 Mary Ann Proctor became the first female undergraduate; she\
      \ transferred from St. Mary's College. In 1972, Angela Sienko, who earned a\
      \ bachelor's degree in marketing, became the first woman graduate from the university.\n\
      \nIn the 18 years under the presidency of Edward Malloy, C.S.C., (1987–2005),\
      \ there was a rapid growth in the school's reputation, faculty, and resources.\
      \ He increased the faculty by more than 500 professors; the academic quality\
      \ of the student body has improved dramatically, with the average SAT score\
      \ rising from 1240 to 1360; the number of minority students more than doubled;\
      \ the endowment grew from $350 million to more than $3 billion; the annual operating\
      \ budget rose from $177 million to more than $650 million; and annual research\
      \ funding improved from $15 million to more than $70 million. Notre Dame's most\
      \ recent (2014) capital campaign raised $2.014 billion, far exceeding its goal\
      \ of $767 million, and is the largest in the history of Catholic higher education\
      \ and the largest of any University without a medical school.\n\nSince 2005,\
      \ Notre Dame has been led by John I. Jenkins, C.S.C., the 17th president of\
      \ the university. Jenkins took over the position from Malloy on July 1, 2005.\
      \ In his inaugural address, Jenkins described his goals of making the university\
      \ a leader in research that recognizes ethics and building the connection between\
      \ faith and studies. During his tenure, Notre Dame has increased its endowment,\
      \ enlarged its student body, and undergone many construction projects on campus,\
      \ including Compton Family Ice Arena, a new architecture hall, additional residence\
      \ halls, and the Campus Crossroads, a $400m enhancement and expansion of Notre\
      \ Dame Stadium.\n\nNotre Dame's campus is located in Notre Dame, Indiana, an\
      \ unincorporated community in the Michiana area of Northern Indiana, north of\
      \ South Bend and four miles (6 km) from the Michigan state line.\nIn September\
      \ 2011, \"Travel+Leisure\" listed Notre Dame as having one of the most beautiful\
      \ college campuses in the United States. Today it lies on just south of the\
      \ Indiana Toll Road and includes 143 buildings located on quads throughout the\
      \ campus.\n\nDevelopment of the campus began in the spring of 1843, when Fr.\
      \ Sorin and some of his congregation built the \"Old College,\" a building used\
      \ for dormitories, a bakery, and a classroom. A year later, after an architect\
      \ arrived, a small \"Main Building\" was built allowing for the launch of the\
      \ college. The Main Building burned down in 1879, and it was immediately replaced\
      \ with the current one. It was topped with the Golden Dome, which today has\
      \ become Notre Dame's most distinguishable feature. Close to the Main Building\
      \ stands Washington Hall (University of Notre Dame), a theater that was built\
      \ in 1881 and has since then been used for theatrical and musical representation.\n\
      Because of its Catholic identity, a number of religious buildings stand on campus.\
      \ The Old College building has become one of two seminaries on campus run by\
      \ the Congregation of Holy Cross. The current Basilica of the Sacred Heart is\
      \ located on the spot of Fr. Sorin's original church, which became too small\
      \ for the growing college. It is built in French Revival style and it is decorated\
      \ by stained glass windows imported directly from France. The interior was painted\
      \ by Luigi Gregori, an Italian painter invited by Fr. Sorin to be artist in\
      \ residence. The Basilica also features a bell tower with a carillon. Inside\
      \ the church there are also sculptures by Ivan Mestrovic. The Grotto of Our\
      \ Lady of Lourdes, which was built in 1896, is a replica of the original in\
      \ Lourdes, France. It is very popular among students and alumni as a place of\
      \ prayer and meditation, and it is considered one of the most beloved spots\
      \ on campus.\n\nA Science Hall was built in 1883 under the direction of Fr.\
      \ Zahm, but in 1950 it was converted to a student union building and named LaFortune\
      \ Center, after Joseph LaFortune, an oil executive from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Commonly\
      \ known as \"LaFortune\" or \"LaFun,\" it is a 4-story building of that provides\
      \ the Notre Dame community with a meeting place for social, recreational, cultural,\
      \ and educational activities. LaFortune employs 35 part-time student staff and\
      \ 29 full-time non-student staff and has an annual budget of $1.2 million.\n\
      Many businesses, services, and divisions of The Office of Student Affairs are\
      \ found within. The building also houses restaurants from national restaurant\
      \ chains.\nSince the construction of its oldest buildings, the university's\
      \ physical plant has grown substantially. Over the years 29 residence halls\
      \ have been built to accommodate students and each has been constructed with\
      \ its own chapel. Many academic building were added together with a system of\
      \ libraries, the most prominent of which is the Theodore Hesburgh Library, built\
      \ in 1963 and today containing almost 4 million books. Since 2004, several buildings\
      \ have been added, including the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the Guglielmino\
      \ Complex, and the Jordan Hall of Science. Additionally, a new residence for\
      \ men, Duncan Hall, was begun on March 8, 2007, and began accepting residents\
      \ for the Fall 2008 semester. Ryan Hall was completed and began housing undergraduate\
      \ women in the fall of 2009. A new engineering building, Stinson-Remick Hall,\
      \ a new combination Center for Social Concerns/Institute for Church Life building,\
      \ Geddes Hall, and a law school addition have recently been completed as well.\
      \ Additionally the new hockey arena opened in the fall of 2011. The Stayer Center\
      \ for Executive Education, which houses the Mendoza College of Business Executive\
      \ Education Department opened in March 2013 just South of the Mendoza College\
      \ of Business building. Because of its long athletic tradition, the university\
      \ features also many building dedicated to sport. The most famous is Notre Dame\
      \ Stadium, home of the Fighting Irish football team; it has been renovated several\
      \ times and today it can hold more than 80 thousand people. Prominent venues\
      \ include also the Edmund P. Joyce Center, with indoor basketball and volleyball\
      \ courts, and the Compton Family Ice Arena, a two-rink facility dedicated to\
      \ hockey. Also, there are many outdoor fields, as the Frank Eck Stadium for\
      \ baseball.\nLegends of Notre Dame (commonly referred to as Legends) is a music\
      \ venue, public house, and restaurant located on the campus of the University\
      \ of Notre Dame, just south of Notre Dame Stadium. The former Alumni Senior\
      \ Club opened its doors the first weekend in September 2003 after a $3.5 million\
      \ renovation and transformed into the all-ages student hang-out that currently\
      \ exists. Legends is made up of two parts: The Restaurant and Alehouse and the\
      \ nightclub.\n\nThe University of Notre Dame has made being a sustainability\
      \ leader an integral part of its mission, creating the Office of Sustainability\
      \ in 2008 to achieve a number of goals in the areas of power generation, design\
      \ and construction, waste reduction, procurement, food services, transportation,\
      \ and water.<ref name=\"About the Office//Office of Sustainability//University\

      \ Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2010, University of Notre Dame\
      \ received a \"B\" grade. The university also houses the Kellog Institute for\
      \ International Peace Studies. Father Gustavo Gutierrez, the founder of Liberation\
      \ Theology is a current faculty member.\n\nThe university owns several centers\
      \ around the world used for international studies and research, conferences\
      \ abroad, and alumni support.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the five Global Getaways,\
      \ the University also holds a presence in Chicago where it owns the Santa Fe\
      \ Building (Chicago).\n\nThe university of Notre Dame is under the leadership\
      \ of the president, who is a priest of the Congregation of Holy Cross. The first\
      \ president was Fr. Edward Sorin and the current president is Fr. John I. Jenkins.\
      \ As of 2016, the provost of the university, who oversees academic functions,\
      \ is Thomas Burish.\nUntil 1967 Notre Dame had been governed directly by the\
      \ Congregation, but under the presidency of the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh two groups,\
      \ the Board of Fellows and the Board of Trustees were established to govern\
      \ the University. The Fellows are a group of six Holy Cross religious and six\
      \ lay members who have final say over the operation of the university. The Fellows\
      \ vote on potential trustees and sign off on all major decisions by that body.\
      \ The Trustees elect the president and provide general guidance and governance\
      \ to the university.\n\nNotre Dame's financial endowment was started in the\
      \ early 1920s by university president James Burns, and increased to US$7 million\
      \ by 1952 when Hesburgh became president. By the 1980s it reached $150 million,\
      \ and in 2000, it returned a record 57.9% investment. For the 2007 fiscal year,\
      \ the endowment had grown to approximately $6.5 billion, putting the university\
      \ in the top-15 largest endowments in the country. As of September 2015, Notre\
      \ Dame's endowment was valued over $10 billion.\n\nAs of fall 2014, Notre Dame\
      \ had 12,292 students and employed 1,126 full-time faculty members and another\
      \ 190 part-time members to give a student/faculty ratio of 8:1.\n\n\nAll of\
      \ Notre Dame's undergraduate students are a part of one of the five undergraduate\
      \ colleges at the school or are in the \"First Year of Studies program\".\n\
      The First Year of Studies program was established in 1962 to guide incoming\
      \ freshmen in their first year at the school before they have declared a major.\
      \ Each student is given an academic advisor from the program who helps them\
      \ to choose classes that give them exposure to any major in which they are interested.\
      \ The program also includes a Learning Resource Center which provides time management,\
      \ collaborative learning, and subject tutoring. This program has been recognized\
      \ previously, by \"U.S. News & World Report\", as outstanding. The program is\
      \ designed to encourage intellectual and academic achievement and innovation\
      \ among first year students. It includes programs such as FY advising, the Dean's\
      \ A list, the Renaissance circle, NDignite, the First year Urban challenge and\
      \ more.\n\nEach admissions cycle, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions selects\
      \ a small number of students for the Glynn Family Honors Program, which grants\
      \ top students within the College of Arts and Letters and the College of Science\
      \ access to smaller class sizes taught by distinguished faculty, endowed funding\
      \ for independent research, and dedicated advising faculty and staff.\n\nThe\
      \ university first offered graduate degrees, in the form of a Master of Arts\
      \ (MA), in the 1854–1855 academic year. The program expanded to include Master\
      \ of Laws (LL.M.) and Master of Civil Engineering in its early stages of growth,\
      \ before a formal graduate school education was developed with a thesis not\
      \ required to receive the degrees. This changed in 1924 with formal requirements\
      \ developed for graduate degrees, including offering Doctorate (PhD) degrees.\n\
      \nIn 2014, Notre Dame announced plans to establish the \"Donald R. Keough School\
      \ of Global Affairs\", a professional school focused on the study of global\
      \ government, human rights, and other areas of global social and political policy.\
      \ The creation of the school is funded by a $50 million gift from Donald Keough\
      \ and Marilyn Keough and will be housed in Jenkins Hall on Debartolo Quad. The\
      \ school is scheduled to open in August 2017.\n\nThe library system of the university\
      \ is divided between the main library and each of the colleges and schools.\
      \ The main building is the 14-story Theodore M. Hesburgh Library, completed\
      \ in 1963, which is the third building to house the main collection of books.\
      \ The front of the library is adorned with the Word of Life mural designed by\
      \ artist Millard Sheets. This mural is popularly known as \"Touchdown Jesus\"\
      \ because of its proximity to Notre Dame Stadium and Jesus' arms appearing to\
      \ make the signal for a touchdown.\n\nThe library system also includes branch\
      \ libraries for Architecture, Chemistry and Physics, Engineering, Law, and Mathematics\
      \ as well as information centers in the Mendoza College of Business, the Kellogg\
      \ Institute for International Studies, the Joan B. Kroc Institute for International\
      \ Peace Studies, and a slide library in O'Shaughnessy Hall. A theology library\
      \ was also opened in fall of 2015. Located on the first floor of Stanford Hall,\
      \ it is the first branch of the library system to be housed in a dorm room.\
      \ The library system holds over three million volumes, was the single largest\
      \ university library in the world upon its completion, and remains one of the\
      \ 100 largest libraries in the country.\n\nNotre Dame is known for its competitive\
      \ admissions, with the incoming class enrolling in fall 2016 admitting 3,655\
      \ from a pool of 19,505 (18.7%). The academic profile of the enrolled class\
      \ continues to rate among the top 10 to 15 in the nation for national research\
      \ universities. Of the most recent class, the Class of 2020, 48% were in the\
      \ top 1% of their high school, and 94% were in the top 10%. The median SAT score\
      \ was 1510 and the median ACt score was 34. The university practices a non-restrictive\
      \ early action policy that allows admitted students to consider admission to\
      \ Notre Dame as well as any other colleges to which they were accepted. 1,400\
      \ of the 3,577 (39.1%) were admitted under the early action plan. Admitted students\
      \ came from 1,311 high schools and the average student traveled more than 750\
      \ miles to Notre Dame, making it arguably the most representative university\
      \ in the United States. While all entering students begin in the College of\
      \ the First Year of Studies, 25% have indicated they plan to study in the liberal\
      \ arts or social sciences, 24% in engineering, 24% in business, 24% in science,\
      \ and 3% in architecture.\n\nIn 2016–2017, Notre Dame ranked 7th for undegraduate\
      \ teaching and 15th overall among \"national universities\" in the United States\
      \ in \"U.S. News & World Report\"s \"Best Colleges 2016\". In 2014, \"USA Today\"\
      \ ranked Notre Dame 10th overall for American universities. \"Forbes\"'s \"\
      America's Top Colleges\" ranks Notre Dame 13th among colleges in the United\
      \ States in 2016, 8th among Research Universities, and 1st in the Midwest. \"\
      U.S. News & World Report\" also lists Notre Dame Law School as 22nd overall.\
      \ \"BusinessWeek\" ranks Mendoza College of Business undergraduate school as\
      \ 1st overall. It ranks the MBA program as 20th overall. The Philosophical Gourmet\
      \ Report ranks Notre Dame's graduate philosophy program as 15th nationally,\
      \ while \"ARCHITECT\" Magazine ranked the undergraduate architecture program\
      \ as 12th nationally.\nAdditionally, the study abroad program ranks sixth in\
      \ highest participation percentage in the nation, with 57.6% of students choosing\
      \ to study abroad in 17 countries. According to PayScale, undergraduate alumni\
      \ of University of Notre Dame have a mid-career median salary $110,000, making\
      \ it the 24th highest among colleges and universities in the United States.\
      \ The median starting salary of $55,300 ranked 58th in the same peer group.\n\
      \nNamed by \"Newsweek\" as one of the \"25 New Ivies,\" it is also an Oak Ridge\
      \ Associated University.\n\nFather Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. was Director of the\
      \ Science Museum and the Library and Professor of Chemistry and Physics until\
      \ 1874. Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress\
      \ were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed\
      \ by the Church. One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm who\
      \ was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and\
      \ by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active\
      \ in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to\
      \ contemporary intellectual issues. His book \"Evolution and Dogma\" (1896)\
      \ defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover,\
      \ that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something\
      \ like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's\
      \ censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt\
      \ embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.\n\nIn 1882, Albert Zahm\
      \ (John Zahm's brother) built an early wind tunnel used to compare lift to drag\
      \ of aeronautical models. Around 1899, Professor Jerome Green became the first\
      \ American to send a wireless message. In 1931, Father Julius Nieuwland performed\
      \ early work on basic reactions that was used to create neoprene. Study of nuclear\
      \ physics at the university began with the building of a nuclear accelerator\
      \ in 1936, and continues now partly through a partnership in the Joint Institute\
      \ for Nuclear Astrophysics.\n\nThe Lobund Institute (Laboratory Of Biology University\
      \ of Notre Dame) grew out of pioneering research in germ-free-life which began\
      \ in 1928. This area of research originated in a question posed by Pasteur as\
      \ to whether animal life was possible without bacteria. Though others had taken\
      \ up this idea, their research was short lived and inconclusive. Lobund was\
      \ the first research organization to answer definitively, that such life is\
      \ possible and that it can be prolonged through generations. But the objective\
      \ was not merely to answer Pasteur's question but also to produce the germ free\
      \ animal as a new tool for biological and medical research. This objective was\
      \ reached and for years Lobund was a unique center for the study and production\
      \ of germ free animals and for their use in biological and medical investigations.\
      \ Today the work has spread to other universities. In the beginning it was under\
      \ the Department of Biology and a program leading to the master's degree accompanied\
      \ the research program. In the 1940s Lobund achieved independent status as a\
      \ purely research organization and in 1950 was raised to the status of an Institute.\
      \ In 1958 it was brought back into the Department of Biology as integral part\
      \ of that department, but with its own program leading to the degree of PhD\
      \ in Gnotobiotics.\nRichard T. Sullivan taught English from 1936 to 1974 and\
      \ published six novels, dozens of short stories, and various other efforts.\
      \ He was known as a regional writer and a Catholic spokesman.\n\nFrank O'Malley\
      \ was an English professor during the 1930s–1960s. Influenced by philosophers\
      \ Jacques Maritain, John U. Nef, and others, O'Malley developed a concept of\
      \ Christian philosophy that was a fundamental element in his thought. Through\
      \ his course \"Modern Catholic Writers\" O'Malley introduced generations of\
      \ undergraduates to Gabriel Marcel, Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh, Sigrid Undset,\
      \ Paul Claudel, and Gerard Manley Hopkins.\n\n\"The Review of Politics\" was\
      \ founded in 1939 by Waldemar Gurian, modeled after German Catholic journals.\
      \ It quickly emerged as part of an international Catholic intellectual revival,\
      \ offering an alternative vision to positivist philosophy. For 44 years, the\
      \ \"Review\" was edited by Gurian, Matthew Fitzsimons, Frederick Crosson, and\
      \ Thomas Stritch. Intellectual leaders included Gurian, Jacques Maritain, Frank\
      \ O'Malley, Leo Richard Ward, F. A. Hermens, and John U. Nef. It became a major\
      \ forum for political ideas and modern political concerns, especially from a\
      \ Catholic and scholastic tradition.\n\nKenneth Sayre has explored the history\
      \ of the Philosophy department. He stresses the abandonment of official Thomism\
      \ to the philosophical pluralism of the 1970s, with attention to the issue of\
      \ being Catholic. He pays special attention to the charismatic personalities\
      \ of Ernan McMullin and Ralph McInerny, key leaders of the department in the\
      \ 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe rise of Hitler and other dictators in the 1930s forced\
      \ numerous Catholic intellectuals to flee Europe; president John O'Hara brought\
      \ many to Notre Dame. From Germany came Anton-Hermann Chroust (1907–1982) in\
      \ classics and law, and Waldemar Gurian a German Catholic intellectual of Jewish\
      \ descent. Positivism dominated American intellectual life in the 1920s onward\
      \ but in marked contrast, Gurian received a German Catholic education and wrote\
      \ his doctoral dissertation under Max Scheler. Ivan Meštrović (1883–1962), a\
      \ renowned sculptor, brought Croatian culture to campus, 1955–62. Yves Simon\
      \ (1903–61), brought to ND in the 1940s the insights of French studies in the\
      \ Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition of philosophy; his own teacher Jacques Maritain\
      \ (1882–73) was a frequent visitor to campus.\n\nThe exiles developed a distinctive\
      \ emphasis on the evils of totalitarianism. For example, the political science\
      \ courses of Gerhart Niemeyer (1907–97) discussed communist ideology and were\
      \ particularly accessible to his students. He came to ND in 1955, and was a\
      \ frequent contributor to the \"National Review\" and other conservative magazines.\n\
      \n research continued in many fields. The university president, John Jenkins,\
      \ described his hope that Notre Dame would become \"one of the pre–eminent research\
      \ institutions in the world\" in his inaugural address. The university has many\
      \ multi-disciplinary institutes devoted to research in varying fields, including\
      \ the Medieval Institute, the Kellogg Institute for International Studies, the\
      \ Kroc Institute for International Peace studies, and the Center for Social\
      \ Concerns. Recent research includes work on family conflict and child development,\
      \ genome mapping, the increasing trade deficit of the United States with China,\
      \ studies in fluid mechanics, computational science and engineering, and marketing\
      \ trends on the Internet. As of 2013, the university is home to the Notre Dame\
      \ Global Adaptation Index which ranks countries annually based on how vulnerable\
      \ they are to climate change and how prepared they are to adapt.\n\nIn 2014\
      \ the Notre Dame student body consisted of 12,179 students, with 8,448 undergraduates,\
      \ 2,138 graduate and professional and 1,593 professional (Law, M.Div., Business,\
      \ M.Ed.) students. Around 21–24% of students are children of alumni, and although\
      \ 37% of students come from the Midwestern United States, the student body represents\
      \ all 50 states and 100 countries. 32% of students are U.S. students of color\
      \ or international citizens. \"The Princeton Review\" ranked the school as the\
      \ fifth highest 'dream school' for parents to send their children. The \"Princeton\
      \ Review\" ranked Notre Dame as the ninth highest. It has also been commended\
      \ by some diversity oriented publications; \"Hispanic Magazine\" in 2004 ranked\
      \ the university ninth on its list of the top–25 colleges for Latinos, and \"\
      The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education\" recognized the university in 2006\
      \ for raising enrollment of African-American students. With 6,000 participants,\
      \ the university's intramural sports program was named in 2004 by \"Sports Illustrated\"\
      \ as the best program in the country, while in 2007 \"The Princeton Review\"\
      \ named it as the top school where \"Everyone Plays Intramural Sports.\" The\
      \ annual Bookstore Basketball tournament is the largest outdoor five-on-five\
      \ tournament in the world with over 700 teams participating each year, while\
      \ the Notre Dame Men's Boxing Club hosts the annual Bengal Bouts tournament\
      \ that raises money for the Holy Cross Missions in Bangladesh.\n\nThe strictly\
      \ measured federal graduation rate for athletes was 90% for freshmen who entered\
      \ between 2005 and 2008. This is the second highest in the country.\n\nAbout\
      \ 80% of undergraduates and 20% of graduate students live on campus. The majority\
      \ of the graduate students on campus live in one of four graduate housing complexes\
      \ on campus, while all on-campus undergraduates live in one of the 31 residence\
      \ halls. Because of the religious affiliation of the university, all residence\
      \ halls are single-sex, with 16 male dorms and 15 female dorms. The university\
      \ maintains a visiting policy (known as parietal hours) for those students who\
      \ live in dormitories, specifying times when members of the opposite sex are\
      \ allowed to visit other students' dorm rooms; however, all residence halls\
      \ have 24-hour social spaces for students regardless of gender. Many residence\
      \ halls have at least one nun and/or priest as a resident. There are no traditional\
      \ social fraternities or sororities at the university, but a majority of students\
      \ live in the same residence hall for all four years. Some intramural sports\
      \ are based on residence hall teams, where the university offers the only non-military\
      \ academy program of full-contact intramural American football. At the end of\
      \ the intramural season, the championship game is played on the field in Notre\
      \ Dame Stadium.\n\nThe university is affiliated with the Congregation of Holy\
      \ Cross (Latin: \"Congregatio a Sancta Cruce\", abbreviated postnominals: \"\
      CSC\"). While religious affiliation is not a criterion for admission, more than\
      \ 93% of students identify as Christian, with over 80% of the total being Catholic.\
      \ Collectively, Catholic Mass is celebrated over 100 times per week on campus,\
      \ and a large campus ministry program provides for the faith needs of the community.\
      \ There are multitudes of religious statues and artwork around campus, most\
      \ prominent of which are the statue of Mary on the Main Building, the Notre\
      \ Dame Grotto, and the Word of Life mural on Hesburgh Library depicting Christ\
      \ as a teacher. Additionally, every classroom displays a crucifix. There are\
      \ many religious clubs (Catholic and non-Catholic) at the school, including\
      \ Council #1477 of the Knights of Columbus (KOC), Baptist Collegiate Ministry\
      \ (BCM), Jewish Club, Muslim Student Association, Orthodox Christian Fellowship,\
      \ The Mormon Club, and many more. The Notre Dame KofC are known for being the\
      \ first collegiate council of KofC, operating a charitable concession stand\
      \ during every home football game and owning their own building on campus which\
      \ can be used as a cigar lounge. Fifty-seven chapels are located throughout\
      \ the campus.\n\nArchitecturally, the school has a Catholic character. Atop\
      \ the Main Building's gold dome is a golden statue of the Virgin Mary. Immediately\
      \ in front of the Main Building and facing it, is a copper statue of Christ\
      \ with arms upraised with the legend \"\"Venite Ad Me Omnes\"\" (Come to me,\
      \ all ye). Next to the Main Building is the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Immediately\
      \ behind the basilica is the Grotto, a Marian place of prayer and reflection.\
      \ It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, France where the Virgin Mary reputedly\
      \ appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 1858. At the end of the main drive\
      \ (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and the Gold Dome),\
      \ is a simple, modern stone statue of Mary.\n\nThe university is the major seat\
      \ of the Congregation of Holy Cross (albeit not its official headquarters, which\
      \ are in Rome). Its main seminary, Moreau Seminary, is located on the campus\
      \ across St. Joseph lake from the Main Building. Old College, the oldest building\
      \ on campus and located near the shore of St. Mary lake, houses undergraduate\
      \ seminarians. Retired priests and brothers reside in Fatima House (a former\
      \ retreat center), Holy Cross House, as well as Columba Hall near the Grotto.\n\
      \nThe university has a highly regarded theology program, both undergraduate\
      \ and graduate, with many scholars, including Lawrence Cunningham, John Cavadini,\
      \ and Gary Anderson. The chair of the department, John Cavadini, was appointed\
      \ to the International Theological Commission by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010;\
      \ Prof. Brian E. Daley, SJ, received the Ratzinger Prize in Theology in 2012.\n\
      As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media\
      \ outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio\
      \ and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page\
      \ journal in September 1876, the \"Scholastic\" magazine is issued twice monthly\
      \ and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United\
      \ States. The other magazine, \"The Juggler\", is released twice a year and\
      \ focuses on student literature and artwork. The \"Dome\" yearbook is published\
      \ annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with \"The Observer\"\
      \ published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed\
      \ by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike \"Scholastic\"\
      \ and \"The Dome,\" \"The Observer\" is an independent publication and does\
      \ not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University.\
      \ In 1987, when some students believed that \"The Observer\" began to show a\
      \ conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, \"Common Sense\" was published. Likewise,\
      \ in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias,\
      \ the conservative paper \"Irish Rover\" went into production. Neither paper\
      \ is published as often as \"The Observer\"; however, all three are distributed\
      \ to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political\
      \ science research, \"Beyond Politics\", made its debut.\n\nThe television station,\
      \ NDtv, grew from one show in 2002 to a full 24-hour channel with original programming\
      \ by September 2006. WSND-FM serves the student body and larger South Bend community\
      \ at 88.9 FM, offering students a chance to become involved in bringing classical\
      \ music, fine arts and educational programming, and alternative rock to the\
      \ airwaves. Another radio station, WVFI, began as a partner of WSND-FM. More\
      \ recently, however, WVFI has been airing independently and is streamed on the\
      \ Internet.\n\nThe first phase of Eddy Street Commons, a $215 million development\
      \ located adjacent to the University of Notre Dame campus and funded by the\
      \ university, broke ground on June 3, 2008. The Eddy Street Commons drew union\
      \ protests when workers hired by the City of South Bend to construct the public\
      \ parking garage picketed the private work site after a contractor hired non-union\
      \ workers. The developer, Kite Realty out of Indianapolis, has made agreements\
      \ with major national chains rather than local businesses, a move that has led\
      \ to criticism from alumni and students.\n\nNotre Dame teams are known as the\
      \ Fighting Irish. They compete as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic\
      \ Association (NCAA) Division I, primarily competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference\
      \ (ACC) for all sports since the 2013–14 school year. The Fighting Irish previously\
      \ competed in the Horizon League from 1982–83 to 1985–86, and again from 1987–88\
      \ to 1994–95, and then in the Big East Conference through 2012–13. Men's sports\
      \ include baseball, basketball, crew, cross country, fencing, football, golf,\
      \ ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis and track & field;\
      \ while women's sports include basketball, cross country, fencing, golf, lacrosse,\
      \ rowing, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, and\
      \ volleyball. The football team competes as an Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS)\
      \ Independent since its inception in 1887. Both fencing teams compete in the\
      \ Midwest Fencing Conference, and the men's ice hockey team competes in Hockey\
      \ East.\n\nNotre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except\
      \ football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference\
      \ realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish\
      \ left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in\
      \ the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed\
      \ to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish\
      \ were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision\
      \ to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated\
      \ in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate\
      \ Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey\
      \ team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced\
      \ it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school\
      \ year.\nThere are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker\
      \ but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with\
      \ respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace\
      \ in his \"New York Daily News\" columns. The official colors of Notre Dame\
      \ are navy blue and gold which are worn in competition by its athletic teams.\
      \ In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname.\
      \ The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by\
      \ Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket\
      \ schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured\
      \ on the cover of \"Time\" in November 1964 and gained national exposure.\n\n\
      On July 1, 2014, the University of Notre Dame and Under Armour reached an agreement\
      \ in which Under Armour will provide uniforms, apparel,equipment, and monetary\
      \ compensation to Notre Dame for 10 years. This contract, worth almost $100\
      \ million, is the most lucrative in the history of the NCAA.\nThe university\
      \ marching band plays at home games for most of the sports. The band, which\
      \ began in 1846 and has a claim as the oldest university band in continuous\
      \ existence in the United States, was honored by the National Music Council\
      \ as a \"Landmark of American Music\" during the United States Bicentennial.\
      \ The band regularly plays the school's fight song the \"Notre Dame Victory\
      \ March\", which was named as the most played and most famous fight song by\
      \ Northern Illinois Professor William Studwell. According to \"College Fight\
      \ Songs: An Annotated Anthology\" published in 1998, the \"Notre Dame Victory\
      \ March\" ranks as the greatest fight song of all time.\n\nAccording to some\
      \ analysts without direct connection to the university or its athletic department,\
      \ Notre Dame promotes Muscular Christianity through its athletic programs.\n\
      \nThe Notre Dame football team has a long history, first beginning when the\
      \ Michigan Wolverines football team brought football to Notre Dame in 1887 and\
      \ played against a group of students. In the long history since then, 13 Fighting\
      \ Irish teams have won consensus national championships (although the university\
      \ only claims 11), along with another nine teams being named national champion\
      \ by at least one source. Additionally, the program has the most members in\
      \ the College Football Hall of Fame, is tied with Ohio State University with\
      \ the most Heisman Trophies won, and have the highest winning percentage in\
      \ NCAA history. With the long history, Notre Dame has accumulated many rivals,\
      \ and its annual game against USC for the Jeweled Shillelagh has been named\
      \ by some as one of the most important in college football and is often called\
      \ the greatest intersectional rivalry in college football in the country.\n\n\
      George Gipp was the school's legendary football player during 1916–20. He played\
      \ semiprofessional baseball and smoked, drank, and gambled when not playing\
      \ sports. He was also humble, generous to the needy, and a man of integrity.\
      \ It was in 1928 that famed coach Knute Rockne used his final conversation with\
      \ the dying Gipp to inspire the Notre Dame team to beat the Army team and \"\
      win one for the Gipper.\" The 1940 film, \"Knute Rockne, All American\", starred\
      \ Pat O'Brien as Knute Rockne and Ronald Reagan as Gipp.\nThe team competes\
      \ in Notre Dame Stadium, an 80,795-seat stadium on campus. The current head\
      \ coach is Brian Kelly, hired from the University of Cincinnati on December\
      \ 11, 2009. Kelly's record in midway through his sixth season at Notre Dame\
      \ is 52–21. In 2012, Kelly's Fighting Irish squad went undefeated and played\
      \ in the BCS National Championship Game. Kelly succeeded Charlie Weis, who was\
      \ fired in November 2009 after five seasons. Although Weis led his team to two\
      \ Bowl Championship Series bowl games, his overall record was 35–27, mediocre\
      \ by Notre Dame standards, and the 2007 team had the most losses in school history.\
      \ The football team generates enough revenue to operate independently while\
      \ $22.1 million is retained from the team's profits for academic use. \"Forbes\"\
      \ named the team as the most valuable in college football, worth a total of\
      \ $101 million in 2007.\nFootball gameday traditions\nDuring home games, activities\
      \ occur all around campus and different dorms decorate their halls with a traditional\
      \ item (e.g., Zahm Hall's two-story banner). Traditional activities begin at\
      \ the stroke of midnight with the Drummers' Circle. This tradition involves\
      \ the drum line of the Band of the Fighting Irish and ushers in the rest of\
      \ the festivities that will continue the rest of the gameday Saturday. Later\
      \ that day, the trumpet section will play the Notre Dame Victory March and the\
      \ Notre Dame Alma Mater under the dome. The entire band will play a concert\
      \ at the steps of Bond Hall, from where they will march into Notre Dame Stadium,\
      \ leading fans and students alike across the campus to the game.\n\nAs of the\
      \ 2014–2015 season, the men's basketball team has over 1,898 wins, one of only\
      \ 8 schools with more wins, and have appeared in 28 NCAA tournaments. Former\
      \ player Austin Carr holds the record for most points scored in a single game\
      \ of the tournament with 61. Although the team has never won the NCAA Tournament,\
      \ they were named by the Helms Athletic Foundation as national champions twice.\
      \ The team has orchestrated a number of upsets of number one ranked teams, the\
      \ most notable of which was ending UCLA's record 88-game winning streak in 1974.\
      \ The team has beaten an additional eight number-one teams, and those nine wins\
      \ rank second, to UCLA's 10, all-time in wins against the top team. The team\
      \ plays in newly renovated Purcell Pavilion (within the Edmund P. Joyce Center),\
      \ which reopened for the beginning of the 2009–2010 season. The team is coached\
      \ by Mike Brey, who, as of the 2015–16 season, his fifteenth at Notre Dame,\
      \ has achieved a 356–177 record. In 2009 they were invited to the NIT, where\
      \ they advanced to the semifinals but were beaten by Penn State who went on\
      \ and beat Baylor in the championship. The 2010–11 team concluded its regular\
      \ season ranked number seven in the country, with a record of 25–5, Brey's fifth\
      \ straight 20-win season, and a second-place finish in the Big East. During\
      \ the 2014–15 season, the team went 32–6 and won the ACC conference tournament,\
      \ later advancing to the Elite 8, where the Fighting Irish lost on a missed\
      \ buzzer-beater against then undefeated Kentucky. Led by NBA draft picks Jerian\
      \ Grant and Pat Connaughton, the Fighting Irish beat the eventual national champion\
      \ Duke Blue Devils twice during the season. The 32 wins were the most by the\
      \ Fighting Irish team since 1908–09.\n\nNotre Dame has been successful in other\
      \ sports besides football, with an additional 14 national championships in various\
      \ sports. Three teams have won multiple national championships with the fencing\
      \ team leading them with seven, followed by the men's tennis and women's soccer\
      \ teams each with two. The men's cross country, men's golf, and women's basketball\
      \ teams have each won one in their histories.\n\nIn the first ten years that\
      \ Notre Dame competed in the Big East Conference its teams won a total of 64\
      \ championships. As of 2010, the women's swimming and diving team holds the\
      \ Big East record for consecutive conference championships in any sport with\
      \ 14 straight conference titles (1997–2010).\n\nThe Band of the Fighting Irish\
      \ is the oldest university band in continuous existence. It was formed in 1846.\
      \ The all-male Glee Club was formed in 1915. The Internationally recognized\
      \ \"Notre Dame Folk Choir\" was founded by Steven \"Cookie\" Warner in 1980.\n\
      \nThe \"Notre Dame Victory March\" is the fight song for the University of Notre\
      \ Dame. It was written by two brothers who were Notre Dame graduates. The Rev.\
      \ Michael J. Shea, a 1904 graduate, wrote the music, and his brother, John F.\
      \ Shea, who earned degrees in 1906 and 1908, wrote the original lyrics. The\
      \ lyrics were revised in the 1920s; it first appeared under the copyright of\
      \ the University of Notre Dame in 1928. The chorus is, \"Cheer cheer for old\
      \ Notre Dame, wake up the echos cheering her name. Send a volley cheer on high,\
      \ shake down the thunder from the sky! What though the odds be great or small,\
      \ old Notre Dame will win over all. While her loyal sons are marching, onward\
      \ to victory!\"\n\nThe chorus of the song is one of the most recognizable collegiate\
      \ fight songs in the United States, and was ranked first among fight songs by\
      \ Northern Illinois University Professor William Studwell, who remarked it was\
      \ \"more borrowed, more famous and, frankly, you just hear it more\".\n\nIn\
      \ the film \"Knute Rockne, All American\", Knute Rockne (played by Pat O'Brien)\
      \ delivers the famous \"Win one for the Gipper\" speech, at which point the\
      \ background music swells with the \"Notre Dame Victory March\". George Gipp\
      \ was played by Ronald Reagan, whose nickname \"The Gipper\" was derived from\
      \ this role. This scene was parodied in the movie \"Airplane!\" with the same\
      \ background music, only this time honoring George Zipp, one of Ted Striker's\
      \ former comrades. The song also was prominent in the movie \"Rudy\", with Sean\
      \ Astin as Daniel \"Rudy\" Ruettiger, who harbored dreams of playing football\
      \ at the University of Notre Dame despite significant obstacles.\n\nNotre Dame\
      \ alumni number near 120,000, and are members of 275 alumni clubs around the\
      \ world. Many alumni give yearly monetary support to the university, with a\
      \ school-record 53.2% giving some donation in 2006. Many buildings on campus\
      \ are named for those whose donations allowed their building, including residence\
      \ halls, classroom buildings, and the performing arts center.\n\nNotre Dame\
      \ alumni work in various fields. Alumni working in political fields include\
      \ state governors, members of the United States Congress, and former United\
      \ States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Notable alumni from the College\
      \ of Science are Eric F. Wieschaus, winner of the 1995 Nobel Prize in medicine,\
      \ and Philip Majerus, discoverer of the cardioprotective effects of aspirin.\
      \ A number of university heads are alumni, including Notre Dame's current president,\
      \ the Rev. John Jenkins. Additionally, many alumni are in the media, including\
      \ talk show hosts Regis Philbin and Phil Donahue, and television and radio personalities\
      \ such as Mike Golic and Hannah Storm. With the university having high-profile\
      \ sports teams itself, a number of alumni went on to become involved in athletics\
      \ outside the university, including professional baseball, basketball, football,\
      \ and ice hockey players, such as Joe Theismann, Joe Montana, Tim Brown, Ross\
      \ Browner, Rocket Ismail, Ruth Riley, Jeff Samardzija, Jerome Bettis, Brett\

    text: "\nThe University of Notre Dame du Lac (or simply Notre Dame ) is a Catholic\
      \ research university located adjacent to South Bend, Indiana, in the United\
      \ States. In French, \"Notre Dame du Lac\" means \"Our Lady of the Lake\" and\
      \ refers to the university's patron saint, the Virgin Mary. The main campus\
      \ covers in a suburban setting and it contains a number of recognizable landmarks,\
      \ such as the Golden Dome, the \"Word of Life\" mural (commonly known as Touchdown\
      \ Jesus), and the Basilica. The school was founded on November 26, 1842, by\
      \ Father Edward Sorin, CSC, who was also its first president, as an all-male\
      \ institution on land donated by the Bishop of Vincennes (Indiana). Today, many\
      \ Holy Cross priests continue to work for the university, including the president\
      \ of the university.\n\nNotre Dame is a large, four-year, highly residential\
      \ research university. It is consistently ranked among the top twenty universities\
      \ in the United States and as a major global university and is highly regarded\
      \ for its undergraduate education. Notre Dame is also ranked as one of the top\
      \ research universities and it has one of the largest endowments in the nation\
      \ with over $10 billion. Undergraduate students are organized into four colleges\
      \ (Arts and Letters, Science, Engineering, Business), and the Architecture School.\
      \ The latter is known for teaching New Classical Architecture and for awarding\
      \ the globally renowned annual Driehaus Architecture Prize.\n\nThe university\
      \ offers over 50 foreign study abroad yearlong programs and over 15 summer programs.\
      \ Notre Dame's graduate program has more than 50 master, doctoral and professional\
      \ degree programs offered by the five schools, with the addition of the Notre\
      \ Dame Law School and a MD-PhD program offered in combination with IU medical\
      \ School. It maintains a system of libraries, cultural venues, artistic and\
      \ scientific museums, including the Hesburgh Library and the Snite Museum of\
      \ Art. The university boasts one of the largest Navy ROTC programs in the nation.\
      \ Over 80% of the university's 8,000 undergraduates live on campus in one of\
      \ 29 single-sex residence halls, each with its own traditions, legacies, events,\
      \ and intramural sports teams. The university counts approximately 120,000 alumni,\
      \ considered among the strongest alumni networks among U.S. colleges.\n\nNotre\
      \ Dame rose to national prominence in the early 1900s for its Fighting Irish\
      \ football team under the guidance of legendary coach Knute Rockne. The university's\
      \ athletic teams are members of the NCAA Division I and are known collectively\
      \ as the Fighting Irish. The football team, an Independent with no conference\
      \ affiliation, has accumulated eleven consensus national championships, seven\
      \ Heisman Trophy winners, 62 members in the College Football Hall of Fame, 13\
      \ members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and is one of the most famed and\
      \ successful college football teams in history. Other ND sport teams, chiefly\
      \ in the Atlantic Coast Conference, have accumulated 16 national championships.\
      \ The Notre Dame Victory March is often regarded as the most famous and recognizable\
      \ collegiate fight song.\n\nStarted as a small all-male institution in 1842\
      \ and charter in 1844, Notre Dame reached international fame at the beginning\
      \ of the 20th century. Major improvements to the university occurred during\
      \ the administration of the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh between 1952 and 1987 as\
      \ Hesburgh's administration greatly increased the university's resources, academic\
      \ programs, and reputation and first enrolled women undergraduates in 1972.\
      \ Ever since, the University has seen steady growth, and under the leadership\
      \ of the next two presidents, Rev. Malloy and Rev. Jenkins, many infrastructure\
      \ and research expansions have been completed.\n\nIn 1842, the Bishop of Vincennes,\
      \ Célestine Guynemer de la Hailandière, offered land to Father Edward Sorin\
      \ of the Congregation of Holy Cross, on the condition that he build a college\
      \ in two years. Fr. Sorin arrived on the site with eight Holy Cross brothers\
      \ from France and Ireland on November 26, 1842, and began the school using Father\
      \ Stephen Badin's old log chapel. He soon erected additional buildings, including\
      \ the Old College, the first church, and the first main building. They immediately\
      \ acquired two students and set about building additions to the campus.\n\n\
      Notre Dame began as a primary and secondary school, but soon received its official\
      \ college charter from the Indiana General Assembly on January 15, 1844. Under\
      \ the charter the school is officially named the University of Notre Dame du\
      \ Lac (University of Our Lady of the Lake). Because the university was originally\
      \ only for male students, the female-only Saint Mary's College was founded by\
      \ the Sisters of the Holy Cross near Notre Dame in 1844.\n\nThe first degrees\
      \ from the college were awarded in 1849. The university was expanded with new\
      \ buildings to accommodate more students and faculty. With each new president,\
      \ new academic programs were offered and new buildings built to accommodate\
      \ them. The original Main Building built by Fr. Sorin just after he arrived\
      \ was replaced by a larger \"Main Building\" in 1865, which housed the university's\
      \ administration, classrooms, and dormitories. Beginning in 1873, a library\
      \ collection was started by Father Lemonnier, housed in the Main Building, and\
      \ by 1879 it had grown to ten thousand volumes. \n\nThis Main Building, and\
      \ the library collection, was entirely destroyed by a fire in April 1879; school\
      \ closed immediately and students were sent home. The university founder, Fr.\
      \ Sorin, and the president at the time, the Rev. William Corby, immediately\
      \ planned for the rebuilding of the structure that had housed virtually the\
      \ entire University. Construction was started on May 17, and by the incredible\
      \ zeal of administrator and workers the building was completed before the fall\
      \ semester of 1879. The library collection was also rebuilt and stayed housed\
      \ in the new Main Building for years afterwards. Around the time of the fire,\
      \ a music hall was opened. Known as Washington Hall, it hosted plays and musical\
      \ acts put on by the school. By 1880, a science program was established at the\
      \ university, and a Science Hall (today LaFortune Student Center) was built\
      \ in 1883. The hall housed multiple classrooms and science labs needed for early\
      \ research at the university.\n\nBy 1890, individual residence halls were built\
      \ to house the increasing number of students.\nWilliam J. Hoynes was dean of\
      \ the law school 1883–1919, and when its new building was opened shortly after\
      \ his death it was renamed in his honor. The Rev. John Zahm C.S.C. became the\
      \ Holy Cross Provincial for the United States (1896–1906), with overall supervision\
      \ of the university. He tried to modernize and expand Notre Dame, erecting buildings\
      \ and adding to the campus art gallery and library, and amassing what became\
      \ a famous Dante collection. His term was not renewed by the Congregation because\
      \ of fears he had expanded Notre Dame too quickly and had run the Holy Cross\
      \ order into serious debt.\n\nIn 1919 Father James Burns became president of\
      \ Notre Dame, and in three years he produced an academic revolution that brought\
      \ the school up to national standards by adopting the elective system and moving\
      \ away from the university's traditional scholastic and classical emphasis.\
      \ By contrast, the Jesuit colleges, bastions of academic conservatism, were\
      \ reluctant to move to a system of electives; for this reason, their graduates\
      \ were shut out of Harvard Law School. Notre Dame continued to grow over the\
      \ years, adding more colleges, programs, and sports teams. By 1921, with the\
      \ addition of the College of Commerce, Notre Dame had grown from a small college\
      \ to a university with five colleges and a professional law school. The university\
      \ continued to expand and add new residence halls and buildings with each subsequent\
      \ president.\n\nOne of the main driving forces in the growth of the University\
      \ was its football team, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Knute Rockne became\
      \ head coach in 1918. Under Rockne, the Irish would post a record of 105 wins,\
      \ 12 losses, and five ties. During his 13 years the Irish won three national\
      \ championships, had five undefeated seasons, won the Rose Bowl in 1925, and\
      \ produced players such as George Gipp and the \"Four Horsemen\". Knute Rockne\
      \ has the highest winning percentage (.881) in NCAA Division I/FBS football\
      \ history. Rockne's offenses employed the Notre Dame Box and his defenses ran\
      \ a 7–2–2 scheme. The last game Rockne coached was on December 14, 1930, when\
      \ he led a group of Notre Dame all-stars against the New York Giants in New\
      \ York City.\n\nThe success of its football team made Notre Dame a household\
      \ name. The success of Notre Dame reflected rising status of Irish Americans\
      \ and Catholics in the 1920s. Catholics rallied up around the team and listened\
      \ to the games on the radio, especially when it knocked off the schools that\
      \ symbolized the Protestant establishment in America—Harvard, Yale, Princeton,\
      \ and Army. Yet this role as high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism\
      \ made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism. The most remarkable episode of\
      \ violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan, a\
      \ white supremacist and anti-catholic movement, in 1924. Nativism and anti-Catholicism,\
      \ especially when directed towards immigrants, were cornerstones of the KKK's\
      \ rhetoric, and Notre Dame was seen as a symbol of the threat posed by the Catholic\
      \ Church. The Klan decided to have a week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes\
      \ with the student body started on March 17, when students, aware of the anti-Catholic\
      \ animosity, blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South\
      \ Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia. On May 19 thousands of\
      \ students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college\
      \ president Fr. Matthew Walsh prevented any further clashes. The next day, football\
      \ coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey\
      \ the college president and refrain from further violence. A few days later\
      \ the Klavern broke up, but the hostility shown by the students was an omen\
      \ and a contribution to the downfall of the KKK in Indiana.\nHoly Cross Father\
      \ John Francis O'Hara was elected vice president in 1933 and president of Notre\
      \ Dame in 1934. During his tenure at Notre Dame, he brought numerous refugee\
      \ intellectuals to campus; he selected Frank H. Spearman, Jeremiah D. M. Ford,\
      \ Irvin Abell, and Josephine Brownson for the Laetare Medal, instituted in 1883.\
      \ O'Hara strongly believed that the Fighting Irish football team could be an\
      \ effective means to \"acquaint the public with the ideals that dominate\" Notre\
      \ Dame. He wrote, \"Notre Dame football is a spiritual service because it is\
      \ played for the honor and glory of God and of his Blessed Mother. When St.\
      \ Paul said: 'Whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all for\
      \ the glory of God,' he included football.\"\n\nThe Rev. John J. Cavanaugh,\
      \ C.S.C. served as president from 1946 to 1952. Cavanaugh's legacy at Notre\
      \ Dame in the post-war years was devoted to raising academic standards and reshaping\
      \ the university administration to suit it to an enlarged educational mission\
      \ and an expanded student body and stressing advanced studies and research at\
      \ a time when Notre Dame quadrupled in student census, undergraduate enrollment\
      \ increased by more than half, and graduate student enrollment grew fivefold.\
      \ Cavanaugh also established the Lobund Institute for Animal Studies and Notre\
      \ Dame's Medieval Institute. Cavanaugh also presided over the construction of\
      \ the Nieuwland Science Hall, Fisher Hall, and the Morris Inn, as well as the\
      \ Hall of Liberal Arts (now O'Shaughnessy Hall), made possible by a donation\
      \ from I.A. O'Shaughnessy, at the time the largest ever made to an American\
      \ Catholic university. He also established a system of advisory councils at\
      \ the university, which continue today and are vital to the university's governance\
      \ and development.\n\nThe Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, C.S.C., (1917–2015) served\
      \ as president for 35 years (1952–87) of dramatic transformations. In that time\
      \ the annual operating budget rose by a factor of 18 from $9.7 million to $176.6\
      \ million, and the endowment by a factor of 40 from $9 million to $350 million,\
      \ and research funding by a factor of 20 from $735,000 to $15 million. Enrollment\
      \ nearly doubled from 4,979 to 9,600, faculty more than doubled 389 to 950,\
      \ and degrees awarded annually doubled from 1,212 to 2,500.\n\nHesburgh is also\
      \ credited with transforming the face of Notre Dame by making it a coeducational\
      \ institution. In the mid-1960s Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College developed\
      \ a co-exchange program whereby several hundred students took classes not offered\
      \ at their home institution, an arrangement that added undergraduate women to\
      \ a campus that already had a few women in the graduate schools. After extensive\
      \ debate, merging with St. Mary's was rejected, primarily because of the differential\
      \ in faculty qualifications and pay scales. \"In American college education,\"\
      \ explained the Rev. Charles E. Sheedy, C.S.C., Notre Dame's Dean of Arts and\
      \ Letters, \"certain features formerly considered advantageous and enviable\
      \ are now seen as anachronistic and out of place... In this environment of diversity,\
      \ the integration of the sexes is a normal and expected aspect, replacing separatism.\"\
      \ Thomas Blantz, C.S.C., Notre Dame's Vice President of Student Affairs, added\
      \ that coeducation \"opened up a whole other pool of very bright students.\"\
      \ Two of the male residence halls were converted for the newly admitted female\
      \ students that first year, while two others were converted for the next school\
      \ year. In 1971 Mary Ann Proctor became the first female undergraduate; she\
      \ transferred from St. Mary's College. In 1972, Angela Sienko, who earned a\
      \ bachelor's degree in marketing, became the first woman graduate from the university.\n\
      \nIn the 18 years under the presidency of Edward Malloy, C.S.C., (1987–2005),\
      \ there was a rapid growth in the school's reputation, faculty, and resources.\
      \ He increased the faculty by more than 500 professors; the academic quality\
      \ of the student body has improved dramatically, with the average SAT score\
      \ rising from 1240 to 1360; the number of minority students more than doubled;\
      \ the endowment grew from $350 million to more than $3 billion; the annual operating\
      \ budget rose from $177 million to more than $650 million; and annual research\
      \ funding improved from $15 million to more than $70 million. Notre Dame's most\
      \ recent (2014) capital campaign raised $2.014 billion, far exceeding its goal\
      \ of $767 million, and is the largest in the history of Catholic higher education\
      \ and the largest of any University without a medical school.\n\nSince 2005,\
      \ Notre Dame has been led by John I. Jenkins, C.S.C., the 17th president of\
      \ the university. Jenkins took over the position from Malloy on July 1, 2005.\
      \ In his inaugural address, Jenkins described his goals of making the university\
      \ a leader in research that recognizes ethics and building the connection between\
      \ faith and studies. During his tenure, Notre Dame has increased its endowment,\
      \ enlarged its student body, and undergone many construction projects on campus,\
      \ including Compton Family Ice Arena, a new architecture hall, additional residence\
      \ halls, and the Campus Crossroads, a $400m enhancement and expansion of Notre\
      \ Dame Stadium.\n\nNotre Dame's campus is located in Notre Dame, Indiana, an\
      \ unincorporated community in the Michiana area of Northern Indiana, north of\
      \ South Bend and four miles (6 km) from the Michigan state line.\nIn September\
      \ 2011, \"Travel+Leisure\" listed Notre Dame as having one of the most beautiful\
      \ college campuses in the United States. Today it lies on just south of the\
      \ Indiana Toll Road and includes 143 buildings located on quads throughout the\
      \ campus.\n\nDevelopment of the campus began in the spring of 1843, when Fr.\
      \ Sorin and some of his congregation built the \"Old College,\" a building used\
      \ for dormitories, a bakery, and a classroom. A year later, after an architect\
      \ arrived, a small \"Main Building\" was built allowing for the launch of the\
      \ college. The Main Building burned down in 1879, and it was immediately replaced\
      \ with the current one. It was topped with the Golden Dome, which today has\
      \ become Notre Dame's most distinguishable feature. Close to the Main Building\
      \ stands Washington Hall (University of Notre Dame), a theater that was built\
      \ in 1881 and has since then been used for theatrical and musical representation.\n\
      Because of its Catholic identity, a number of religious buildings stand on campus.\
      \ The Old College building has become one of two seminaries on campus run by\
      \ the Congregation of Holy Cross. The current Basilica of the Sacred Heart is\
      \ located on the spot of Fr. Sorin's original church, which became too small\
      \ for the growing college. It is built in French Revival style and it is decorated\
      \ by stained glass windows imported directly from France. The interior was painted\
      \ by Luigi Gregori, an Italian painter invited by Fr. Sorin to be artist in\
      \ residence. The Basilica also features a bell tower with a carillon. Inside\
      \ the church there are also sculptures by Ivan Mestrovic. The Grotto of Our\
      \ Lady of Lourdes, which was built in 1896, is a replica of the original in\
      \ Lourdes, France. It is very popular among students and alumni as a place of\
      \ prayer and meditation, and it is considered one of the most beloved spots\
      \ on campus.\n\nA Science Hall was built in 1883 under the direction of Fr.\
      \ Zahm, but in 1950 it was converted to a student union building and named LaFortune\
      \ Center, after Joseph LaFortune, an oil executive from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Commonly\
      \ known as \"LaFortune\" or \"LaFun,\" it is a 4-story building of that provides\
      \ the Notre Dame community with a meeting place for social, recreational, cultural,\
      \ and educational activities. LaFortune employs 35 part-time student staff and\
      \ 29 full-time non-student staff and has an annual budget of $1.2 million.\n\
      Many businesses, services, and divisions of The Office of Student Affairs are\
      \ found within. The building also houses restaurants from national restaurant\
      \ chains.\nSince the construction of its oldest buildings, the university's\
      \ physical plant has grown substantially. Over the years 29 residence halls\
      \ have been built to accommodate students and each has been constructed with\
      \ its own chapel. Many academic building were added together with a system of\
      \ libraries, the most prominent of which is the Theodore Hesburgh Library, built\
      \ in 1963 and today containing almost 4 million books. Since 2004, several buildings\
      \ have been added, including the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the Guglielmino\
      \ Complex, and the Jordan Hall of Science. Additionally, a new residence for\
      \ men, Duncan Hall, was begun on March 8, 2007, and began accepting residents\
      \ for the Fall 2008 semester. Ryan Hall was completed and began housing undergraduate\
      \ women in the fall of 2009. A new engineering building, Stinson-Remick Hall,\
      \ a new combination Center for Social Concerns/Institute for Church Life building,\
      \ Geddes Hall, and a law school addition have recently been completed as well.\
      \ Additionally the new hockey arena opened in the fall of 2011. The Stayer Center\
      \ for Executive Education, which houses the Mendoza College of Business Executive\
      \ Education Department opened in March 2013 just South of the Mendoza College\
      \ of Business building. Because of its long athletic tradition, the university\
      \ features also many building dedicated to sport. The most famous is Notre Dame\
      \ Stadium, home of the Fighting Irish football team; it has been renovated several\
      \ times and today it can hold more than 80 thousand people. Prominent venues\
      \ include also the Edmund P. Joyce Center, with indoor basketball and volleyball\
      \ courts, and the Compton Family Ice Arena, a two-rink facility dedicated to\
      \ hockey. Also, there are many outdoor fields, as the Frank Eck Stadium for\
      \ baseball.\nLegends of Notre Dame (commonly referred to as Legends) is a music\
      \ venue, public house, and restaurant located on the campus of the University\
      \ of Notre Dame, just south of Notre Dame Stadium. The former Alumni Senior\
      \ Club opened its doors the first weekend in September 2003 after a $3.5 million\
      \ renovation and transformed into the all-ages student hang-out that currently\
      \ exists. Legends is made up of two parts: The Restaurant and Alehouse and the\
      \ nightclub.\n\nThe University of Notre Dame has made being a sustainability\
      \ leader an integral part of its mission, creating the Office of Sustainability\
      \ in 2008 to achieve a number of goals in the areas of power generation, design\
      \ and construction, waste reduction, procurement, food services, transportation,\
      \ and water.<ref name=\"About the Office//Office of Sustainability//University\

      \ Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2010, University of Notre Dame\
      \ received a \"B\" grade. The university also houses the Kellog Institute for\
      \ International Peace Studies. Father Gustavo Gutierrez, the founder of Liberation\
      \ Theology is a current faculty member.\n\nThe university owns several centers\
      \ around the world used for international studies and research, conferences\
      \ abroad, and alumni support.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the five Global Getaways,\
      \ the University also holds a presence in Chicago where it owns the Santa Fe\
      \ Building (Chicago).\n\nThe university of Notre Dame is under the leadership\
      \ of the president, who is a priest of the Congregation of Holy Cross. The first\
      \ president was Fr. Edward Sorin and the current president is Fr. John I. Jenkins.\
      \ As of 2016, the provost of the university, who oversees academic functions,\
      \ is Thomas Burish.\nUntil 1967 Notre Dame had been governed directly by the\
      \ Congregation, but under the presidency of the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh two groups,\
      \ the Board of Fellows and the Board of Trustees were established to govern\
      \ the University. The Fellows are a group of six Holy Cross religious and six\
      \ lay members who have final say over the operation of the university. The Fellows\
      \ vote on potential trustees and sign off on all major decisions by that body.\
      \ The Trustees elect the president and provide general guidance and governance\
      \ to the university.\n\nNotre Dame's financial endowment was started in the\
      \ early 1920s by university president James Burns, and increased to US$7 million\
      \ by 1952 when Hesburgh became president. By the 1980s it reached $150 million,\
      \ and in 2000, it returned a record 57.9% investment. For the 2007 fiscal year,\
      \ the endowment had grown to approximately $6.5 billion, putting the university\
      \ in the top-15 largest endowments in the country. As of September 2015, Notre\
      \ Dame's endowment was valued over $10 billion.\n\nAs of fall 2014, Notre Dame\
      \ had 12,292 students and employed 1,126 full-time faculty members and another\
      \ 190 part-time members to give a student/faculty ratio of 8:1.\n\n\nAll of\
      \ Notre Dame's undergraduate students are a part of one of the five undergraduate\
      \ colleges at the school or are in the \"First Year of Studies program\".\n\
      The First Year of Studies program was established in 1962 to guide incoming\
      \ freshmen in their first year at the school before they have declared a major.\
      \ Each student is given an academic advisor from the program who helps them\
      \ to choose classes that give them exposure to any major in which they are interested.\
      \ The program also includes a Learning Resource Center which provides time management,\
      \ collaborative learning, and subject tutoring. This program has been recognized\
      \ previously, by \"U.S. News & World Report\", as outstanding. The program is\
      \ designed to encourage intellectual and academic achievement and innovation\
      \ among first year students. It includes programs such as FY advising, the Dean's\
      \ A list, the Renaissance circle, NDignite, the First year Urban challenge and\
      \ more.\n\nEach admissions cycle, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions selects\
      \ a small number of students for the Glynn Family Honors Program, which grants\
      \ top students within the College of Arts and Letters and the College of Science\
      \ access to smaller class sizes taught by distinguished faculty, endowed funding\
      \ for independent research, and dedicated advising faculty and staff.\n\nThe\
      \ university first offered graduate degrees, in the form of a Master of Arts\
      \ (MA), in the 1854–1855 academic year. The program expanded to include Master\
      \ of Laws (LL.M.) and Master of Civil Engineering in its early stages of growth,\
      \ before a formal graduate school education was developed with a thesis not\
      \ required to receive the degrees. This changed in 1924 with formal requirements\
      \ developed for graduate degrees, including offering Doctorate (PhD) degrees.\n\
      \nIn 2014, Notre Dame announced plans to establish the \"Donald R. Keough School\
      \ of Global Affairs\", a professional school focused on the study of global\
      \ government, human rights, and other areas of global social and political policy.\
      \ The creation of the school is funded by a $50 million gift from Donald Keough\
      \ and Marilyn Keough and will be housed in Jenkins Hall on Debartolo Quad. The\
      \ school is scheduled to open in August 2017.\n\nThe library system of the university\
      \ is divided between the main library and each of the colleges and schools.\
      \ The main building is the 14-story Theodore M. Hesburgh Library, completed\
      \ in 1963, which is the third building to house the main collection of books.\
      \ The front of the library is adorned with the Word of Life mural designed by\
      \ artist Millard Sheets. This mural is popularly known as \"Touchdown Jesus\"\
      \ because of its proximity to Notre Dame Stadium and Jesus' arms appearing to\
      \ make the signal for a touchdown.\n\nThe library system also includes branch\
      \ libraries for Architecture, Chemistry and Physics, Engineering, Law, and Mathematics\
      \ as well as information centers in the Mendoza College of Business, the Kellogg\
      \ Institute for International Studies, the Joan B. Kroc Institute for International\
      \ Peace Studies, and a slide library in O'Shaughnessy Hall. A theology library\
      \ was also opened in fall of 2015. Located on the first floor of Stanford Hall,\
      \ it is the first branch of the library system to be housed in a dorm room.\
      \ The library system holds over three million volumes, was the single largest\
      \ university library in the world upon its completion, and remains one of the\
      \ 100 largest libraries in the country.\n\nNotre Dame is known for its competitive\
      \ admissions, with the incoming class enrolling in fall 2016 admitting 3,655\
      \ from a pool of 19,505 (18.7%). The academic profile of the enrolled class\
      \ continues to rate among the top 10 to 15 in the nation for national research\
      \ universities. Of the most recent class, the Class of 2020, 48% were in the\
      \ top 1% of their high school, and 94% were in the top 10%. The median SAT score\
      \ was 1510 and the median ACt score was 34. The university practices a non-restrictive\
      \ early action policy that allows admitted students to consider admission to\
      \ Notre Dame as well as any other colleges to which they were accepted. 1,400\
      \ of the 3,577 (39.1%) were admitted under the early action plan. Admitted students\
      \ came from 1,311 high schools and the average student traveled more than 750\
      \ miles to Notre Dame, making it arguably the most representative university\
      \ in the United States. While all entering students begin in the College of\
      \ the First Year of Studies, 25% have indicated they plan to study in the liberal\
      \ arts or social sciences, 24% in engineering, 24% in business, 24% in science,\
      \ and 3% in architecture.\n\nIn 2016–2017, Notre Dame ranked 7th for undegraduate\
      \ teaching and 15th overall among \"national universities\" in the United States\
      \ in \"U.S. News & World Report\"s \"Best Colleges 2016\". In 2014, \"USA Today\"\
      \ ranked Notre Dame 10th overall for American universities. \"Forbes\"'s \"\
      America's Top Colleges\" ranks Notre Dame 13th among colleges in the United\
      \ States in 2016, 8th among Research Universities, and 1st in the Midwest. \"\
      U.S. News & World Report\" also lists Notre Dame Law School as 22nd overall.\
      \ \"BusinessWeek\" ranks Mendoza College of Business undergraduate school as\
      \ 1st overall. It ranks the MBA program as 20th overall. The Philosophical Gourmet\
      \ Report ranks Notre Dame's graduate philosophy program as 15th nationally,\
      \ while \"ARCHITECT\" Magazine ranked the undergraduate architecture program\
      \ as 12th nationally.\nAdditionally, the study abroad program ranks sixth in\
      \ highest participation percentage in the nation, with 57.6% of students choosing\
      \ to study abroad in 17 countries. According to PayScale, undergraduate alumni\
      \ of University of Notre Dame have a mid-career median salary $110,000, making\
      \ it the 24th highest among colleges and universities in the United States.\
      \ The median starting salary of $55,300 ranked 58th in the same peer group.\n\
      \nNamed by \"Newsweek\" as one of the \"25 New Ivies,\" it is also an Oak Ridge\
      \ Associated University.\n\nFather Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. was Director of the\
      \ Science Museum and the Library and Professor of Chemistry and Physics until\
      \ 1874. Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress\
      \ were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed\
      \ by the Church. One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm who\
      \ was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and\
      \ by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active\
      \ in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to\
      \ contemporary intellectual issues. His book \"Evolution and Dogma\" (1896)\
      \ defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover,\
      \ that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something\
      \ like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's\
      \ censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt\
      \ embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.\n\nIn 1882, Albert Zahm\
      \ (John Zahm's brother) built an early wind tunnel used to compare lift to drag\
      \ of aeronautical models. Around 1899, Professor Jerome Green became the first\
      \ American to send a wireless message. In 1931, Father Julius Nieuwland performed\
      \ early work on basic reactions that was used to create neoprene. Study of nuclear\
      \ physics at the university began with the building of a nuclear accelerator\
      \ in 1936, and continues now partly through a partnership in the Joint Institute\
      \ for Nuclear Astrophysics.\n\nThe Lobund Institute (Laboratory Of Biology University\
      \ of Notre Dame) grew out of pioneering research in germ-free-life which began\
      \ in 1928. This area of research originated in a question posed by Pasteur as\
      \ to whether animal life was possible without bacteria. Though others had taken\
      \ up this idea, their research was short lived and inconclusive. Lobund was\
      \ the first research organization to answer definitively, that such life is\
      \ possible and that it can be prolonged through generations. But the objective\
      \ was not merely to answer Pasteur's question but also to produce the germ free\
      \ animal as a new tool for biological and medical research. This objective was\
      \ reached and for years Lobund was a unique center for the study and production\
      \ of germ free animals and for their use in biological and medical investigations.\
      \ Today the work has spread to other universities. In the beginning it was under\
      \ the Department of Biology and a program leading to the master's degree accompanied\
      \ the research program. In the 1940s Lobund achieved independent status as a\
      \ purely research organization and in 1950 was raised to the status of an Institute.\
      \ In 1958 it was brought back into the Department of Biology as integral part\
      \ of that department, but with its own program leading to the degree of PhD\
      \ in Gnotobiotics.\nRichard T. Sullivan taught English from 1936 to 1974 and\
      \ published six novels, dozens of short stories, and various other efforts.\
      \ He was known as a regional writer and a Catholic spokesman.\n\nFrank O'Malley\
      \ was an English professor during the 1930s–1960s. Influenced by philosophers\
      \ Jacques Maritain, John U. Nef, and others, O'Malley developed a concept of\
      \ Christian philosophy that was a fundamental element in his thought. Through\
      \ his course \"Modern Catholic Writers\" O'Malley introduced generations of\
      \ undergraduates to Gabriel Marcel, Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh, Sigrid Undset,\
      \ Paul Claudel, and Gerard Manley Hopkins.\n\n\"The Review of Politics\" was\
      \ founded in 1939 by Waldemar Gurian, modeled after German Catholic journals.\
      \ It quickly emerged as part of an international Catholic intellectual revival,\
      \ offering an alternative vision to positivist philosophy. For 44 years, the\
      \ \"Review\" was edited by Gurian, Matthew Fitzsimons, Frederick Crosson, and\
      \ Thomas Stritch. Intellectual leaders included Gurian, Jacques Maritain, Frank\
      \ O'Malley, Leo Richard Ward, F. A. Hermens, and John U. Nef. It became a major\
      \ forum for political ideas and modern political concerns, especially from a\
      \ Catholic and scholastic tradition.\n\nKenneth Sayre has explored the history\
      \ of the Philosophy department. He stresses the abandonment of official Thomism\
      \ to the philosophical pluralism of the 1970s, with attention to the issue of\
      \ being Catholic. He pays special attention to the charismatic personalities\
      \ of Ernan McMullin and Ralph McInerny, key leaders of the department in the\
      \ 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe rise of Hitler and other dictators in the 1930s forced\
      \ numerous Catholic intellectuals to flee Europe; president John O'Hara brought\
      \ many to Notre Dame. From Germany came Anton-Hermann Chroust (1907–1982) in\
      \ classics and law, and Waldemar Gurian a German Catholic intellectual of Jewish\
      \ descent. Positivism dominated American intellectual life in the 1920s onward\
      \ but in marked contrast, Gurian received a German Catholic education and wrote\
      \ his doctoral dissertation under Max Scheler. Ivan Meštrović (1883–1962), a\
      \ renowned sculptor, brought Croatian culture to campus, 1955–62. Yves Simon\
      \ (1903–61), brought to ND in the 1940s the insights of French studies in the\
      \ Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition of philosophy; his own teacher Jacques Maritain\
      \ (1882–73) was a frequent visitor to campus.\n\nThe exiles developed a distinctive\
      \ emphasis on the evils of totalitarianism. For example, the political science\
      \ courses of Gerhart Niemeyer (1907–97) discussed communist ideology and were\
      \ particularly accessible to his students. He came to ND in 1955, and was a\
      \ frequent contributor to the \"National Review\" and other conservative magazines.\n\
      \n research continued in many fields. The university president, John Jenkins,\
      \ described his hope that Notre Dame would become \"one of the pre–eminent research\
      \ institutions in the world\" in his inaugural address. The university has many\
      \ multi-disciplinary institutes devoted to research in varying fields, including\
      \ the Medieval Institute, the Kellogg Institute for International Studies, the\
      \ Kroc Institute for International Peace studies, and the Center for Social\
      \ Concerns. Recent research includes work on family conflict and child development,\
      \ genome mapping, the increasing trade deficit of the United States with China,\
      \ studies in fluid mechanics, computational science and engineering, and marketing\
      \ trends on the Internet. As of 2013, the university is home to the Notre Dame\
      \ Global Adaptation Index which ranks countries annually based on how vulnerable\
      \ they are to climate change and how prepared they are to adapt.\n\nIn 2014\
      \ the Notre Dame student body consisted of 12,179 students, with 8,448 undergraduates,\
      \ 2,138 graduate and professional and 1,593 professional (Law, M.Div., Business,\
      \ M.Ed.) students. Around 21–24% of students are children of alumni, and although\
      \ 37% of students come from the Midwestern United States, the student body represents\
      \ all 50 states and 100 countries. 32% of students are U.S. students of color\
      \ or international citizens. \"The Princeton Review\" ranked the school as the\
      \ fifth highest 'dream school' for parents to send their children. The \"Princeton\
      \ Review\" ranked Notre Dame as the ninth highest. It has also been commended\
      \ by some diversity oriented publications; \"Hispanic Magazine\" in 2004 ranked\
      \ the university ninth on its list of the top–25 colleges for Latinos, and \"\
      The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education\" recognized the university in 2006\
      \ for raising enrollment of African-American students. With 6,000 participants,\
      \ the university's intramural sports program was named in 2004 by \"Sports Illustrated\"\
      \ as the best program in the country, while in 2007 \"The Princeton Review\"\
      \ named it as the top school where \"Everyone Plays Intramural Sports.\" The\
      \ annual Bookstore Basketball tournament is the largest outdoor five-on-five\
      \ tournament in the world with over 700 teams participating each year, while\
      \ the Notre Dame Men's Boxing Club hosts the annual Bengal Bouts tournament\
      \ that raises money for the Holy Cross Missions in Bangladesh.\n\nThe strictly\
      \ measured federal graduation rate for athletes was 90% for freshmen who entered\
      \ between 2005 and 2008. This is the second highest in the country.\n\nAbout\
      \ 80% of undergraduates and 20% of graduate students live on campus. The majority\
      \ of the graduate students on campus live in one of four graduate housing complexes\
      \ on campus, while all on-campus undergraduates live in one of the 31 residence\
      \ halls. Because of the religious affiliation of the university, all residence\
      \ halls are single-sex, with 16 male dorms and 15 female dorms. The university\
      \ maintains a visiting policy (known as parietal hours) for those students who\
      \ live in dormitories, specifying times when members of the opposite sex are\
      \ allowed to visit other students' dorm rooms; however, all residence halls\
      \ have 24-hour social spaces for students regardless of gender. Many residence\
      \ halls have at least one nun and/or priest as a resident. There are no traditional\
      \ social fraternities or sororities at the university, but a majority of students\
      \ live in the same residence hall for all four years. Some intramural sports\
      \ are based on residence hall teams, where the university offers the only non-military\
      \ academy program of full-contact intramural American football. At the end of\
      \ the intramural season, the championship game is played on the field in Notre\
      \ Dame Stadium.\n\nThe university is affiliated with the Congregation of Holy\
      \ Cross (Latin: \"Congregatio a Sancta Cruce\", abbreviated postnominals: \"\
      CSC\"). While religious affiliation is not a criterion for admission, more than\
      \ 93% of students identify as Christian, with over 80% of the total being Catholic.\
      \ Collectively, Catholic Mass is celebrated over 100 times per week on campus,\
      \ and a large campus ministry program provides for the faith needs of the community.\
      \ There are multitudes of religious statues and artwork around campus, most\
      \ prominent of which are the statue of Mary on the Main Building, the Notre\
      \ Dame Grotto, and the Word of Life mural on Hesburgh Library depicting Christ\
      \ as a teacher. Additionally, every classroom displays a crucifix. There are\
      \ many religious clubs (Catholic and non-Catholic) at the school, including\
      \ Council #1477 of the Knights of Columbus (KOC), Baptist Collegiate Ministry\
      \ (BCM), Jewish Club, Muslim Student Association, Orthodox Christian Fellowship,\
      \ The Mormon Club, and many more. The Notre Dame KofC are known for being the\
      \ first collegiate council of KofC, operating a charitable concession stand\
      \ during every home football game and owning their own building on campus which\
      \ can be used as a cigar lounge. Fifty-seven chapels are located throughout\
      \ the campus.\n\nArchitecturally, the school has a Catholic character. Atop\
      \ the Main Building's gold dome is a golden statue of the Virgin Mary. Immediately\
      \ in front of the Main Building and facing it, is a copper statue of Christ\
      \ with arms upraised with the legend \"\"Venite Ad Me Omnes\"\" (Come to me,\
      \ all ye). Next to the Main Building is the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Immediately\
      \ behind the basilica is the Grotto, a Marian place of prayer and reflection.\
      \ It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, France where the Virgin Mary reputedly\
      \ appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 1858. At the end of the main drive\
      \ (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and the Gold Dome),\
      \ is a simple, modern stone statue of Mary.\n\nThe university is the major seat\
      \ of the Congregation of Holy Cross (albeit not its official headquarters, which\
      \ are in Rome). Its main seminary, Moreau Seminary, is located on the campus\
      \ across St. Joseph lake from the Main Building. Old College, the oldest building\
      \ on campus and located near the shore of St. Mary lake, houses undergraduate\
      \ seminarians. Retired priests and brothers reside in Fatima House (a former\
      \ retreat center), Holy Cross House, as well as Columba Hall near the Grotto.\n\
      \nThe university has a highly regarded theology program, both undergraduate\
      \ and graduate, with many scholars, including Lawrence Cunningham, John Cavadini,\
      \ and Gary Anderson. The chair of the department, John Cavadini, was appointed\
      \ to the International Theological Commission by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010;\
      \ Prof. Brian E. Daley, SJ, received the Ratzinger Prize in Theology in 2012.\n\
      As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media\
      \ outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio\
      \ and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page\
      \ journal in September 1876, the \"Scholastic\" magazine is issued twice monthly\
      \ and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United\
      \ States. The other magazine, \"The Juggler\", is released twice a year and\
      \ focuses on student literature and artwork. The \"Dome\" yearbook is published\
      \ annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with \"The Observer\"\
      \ published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed\
      \ by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike \"Scholastic\"\
      \ and \"The Dome,\" \"The Observer\" is an independent publication and does\
      \ not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University.\
      \ In 1987, when some students believed that \"The Observer\" began to show a\
      \ conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, \"Common Sense\" was published. Likewise,\
      \ in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias,\
      \ the conservative paper \"Irish Rover\" went into production. Neither paper\
      \ is published as often as \"The Observer\"; however, all three are distributed\
      \ to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political\
      \ science research, \"Beyond Politics\", made its debut.\n\nThe television station,\
      \ NDtv, grew from one show in 2002 to a full 24-hour channel with original programming\
      \ by September 2006. WSND-FM serves the student body and larger South Bend community\
      \ at 88.9 FM, offering students a chance to become involved in bringing classical\
      \ music, fine arts and educational programming, and alternative rock to the\
      \ airwaves. Another radio station, WVFI, began as a partner of WSND-FM. More\
      \ recently, however, WVFI has been airing independently and is streamed on the\
      \ Internet.\n\nThe first phase of Eddy Street Commons, a $215 million development\
      \ located adjacent to the University of Notre Dame campus and funded by the\
      \ university, broke ground on June 3, 2008. The Eddy Street Commons drew union\
      \ protests when workers hired by the City of South Bend to construct the public\
      \ parking garage picketed the private work site after a contractor hired non-union\
      \ workers. The developer, Kite Realty out of Indianapolis, has made agreements\
      \ with major national chains rather than local businesses, a move that has led\
      \ to criticism from alumni and students.\n\nNotre Dame teams are known as the\
      \ Fighting Irish. They compete as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic\
      \ Association (NCAA) Division I, primarily competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference\
      \ (ACC) for all sports since the 2013–14 school year. The Fighting Irish previously\
      \ competed in the Horizon League from 1982–83 to 1985–86, and again from 1987–88\
      \ to 1994–95, and then in the Big East Conference through 2012–13. Men's sports\
      \ include baseball, basketball, crew, cross country, fencing, football, golf,\
      \ ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis and track & field;\
      \ while women's sports include basketball, cross country, fencing, golf, lacrosse,\
      \ rowing, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, and\
      \ volleyball. The football team competes as an Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS)\
      \ Independent since its inception in 1887. Both fencing teams compete in the\
      \ Midwest Fencing Conference, and the men's ice hockey team competes in Hockey\
      \ East.\n\nNotre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except\
      \ football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference\
      \ realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish\
      \ left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in\
      \ the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed\
      \ to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish\
      \ were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision\
      \ to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated\
      \ in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate\
      \ Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey\
      \ team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced\
      \ it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school\
      \ year.\nThere are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker\
      \ but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with\
      \ respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace\
      \ in his \"New York Daily News\" columns. The official colors of Notre Dame\
      \ are navy blue and gold which are worn in competition by its athletic teams.\
      \ In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname.\
      \ The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by\
      \ Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket\
      \ schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured\
      \ on the cover of \"Time\" in November 1964 and gained national exposure.\n\n\
      On July 1, 2014, the University of Notre Dame and Under Armour reached an agreement\
      \ in which Under Armour will provide uniforms, apparel,equipment, and monetary\
      \ compensation to Notre Dame for 10 years. This contract, worth almost $100\
      \ million, is the most lucrative in the history of the NCAA.\nThe university\
      \ marching band plays at home games for most of the sports. The band, which\
      \ began in 1846 and has a claim as the oldest university band in continuous\
      \ existence in the United States, was honored by the National Music Council\
      \ as a \"Landmark of American Music\" during the United States Bicentennial.\
      \ The band regularly plays the school's fight song the \"Notre Dame Victory\
      \ March\", which was named as the most played and most famous fight song by\
      \ Northern Illinois Professor William Studwell. According to \"College Fight\
      \ Songs: An Annotated Anthology\" published in 1998, the \"Notre Dame Victory\
      \ March\" ranks as the greatest fight song of all time.\n\nAccording to some\
      \ analysts without direct connection to the university or its athletic department,\
      \ Notre Dame promotes Muscular Christianity through its athletic programs.\n\
      \nThe Notre Dame football team has a long history, first beginning when the\
      \ Michigan Wolverines football team brought football to Notre Dame in 1887 and\
      \ played against a group of students. In the long history since then, 13 Fighting\
      \ Irish teams have won consensus national championships (although the university\
      \ only claims 11), along with another nine teams being named national champion\
      \ by at least one source. Additionally, the program has the most members in\
      \ the College Football Hall of Fame, is tied with Ohio State University with\
      \ the most Heisman Trophies won, and have the highest winning percentage in\
      \ NCAA history. With the long history, Notre Dame has accumulated many rivals,\
      \ and its annual game against USC for the Jeweled Shillelagh has been named\
      \ by some as one of the most important in college football and is often called\
      \ the greatest intersectional rivalry in college football in the country.\n\n\
      George Gipp was the school's legendary football player during 1916–20. He played\
      \ semiprofessional baseball and smoked, drank, and gambled when not playing\
      \ sports. He was also humble, generous to the needy, and a man of integrity.\
      \ It was in 1928 that famed coach Knute Rockne used his final conversation with\
      \ the dying Gipp to inspire the Notre Dame team to beat the Army team and \"\
      win one for the Gipper.\" The 1940 film, \"Knute Rockne, All American\", starred\
      \ Pat O'Brien as Knute Rockne and Ronald Reagan as Gipp.\nThe team competes\
      \ in Notre Dame Stadium, an 80,795-seat stadium on campus. The current head\
      \ coach is Brian Kelly, hired from the University of Cincinnati on December\
      \ 11, 2009. Kelly's record in midway through his sixth season at Notre Dame\
      \ is 52–21. In 2012, Kelly's Fighting Irish squad went undefeated and played\
      \ in the BCS National Championship Game. Kelly succeeded Charlie Weis, who was\
      \ fired in November 2009 after five seasons. Although Weis led his team to two\
      \ Bowl Championship Series bowl games, his overall record was 35–27, mediocre\
      \ by Notre Dame standards, and the 2007 team had the most losses in school history.\
      \ The football team generates enough revenue to operate independently while\
      \ $22.1 million is retained from the team's profits for academic use. \"Forbes\"\
      \ named the team as the most valuable in college football, worth a total of\
      \ $101 million in 2007.\nFootball gameday traditions\nDuring home games, activities\
      \ occur all around campus and different dorms decorate their halls with a traditional\
      \ item (e.g., Zahm Hall's two-story banner). Traditional activities begin at\
      \ the stroke of midnight with the Drummers' Circle. This tradition involves\
      \ the drum line of the Band of the Fighting Irish and ushers in the rest of\
      \ the festivities that will continue the rest of the gameday Saturday. Later\
      \ that day, the trumpet section will play the Notre Dame Victory March and the\
      \ Notre Dame Alma Mater under the dome. The entire band will play a concert\
      \ at the steps of Bond Hall, from where they will march into Notre Dame Stadium,\
      \ leading fans and students alike across the campus to the game.\n\nAs of the\
      \ 2014–2015 season, the men's basketball team has over 1,898 wins, one of only\
      \ 8 schools with more wins, and have appeared in 28 NCAA tournaments. Former\
      \ player Austin Carr holds the record for most points scored in a single game\
      \ of the tournament with 61. Although the team has never won the NCAA Tournament,\
      \ they were named by the Helms Athletic Foundation as national champions twice.\
      \ The team has orchestrated a number of upsets of number one ranked teams, the\
      \ most notable of which was ending UCLA's record 88-game winning streak in 1974.\
      \ The team has beaten an additional eight number-one teams, and those nine wins\
      \ rank second, to UCLA's 10, all-time in wins against the top team. The team\
      \ plays in newly renovated Purcell Pavilion (within the Edmund P. Joyce Center),\
      \ which reopened for the beginning of the 2009–2010 season. The team is coached\
      \ by Mike Brey, who, as of the 2015–16 season, his fifteenth at Notre Dame,\
      \ has achieved a 356–177 record. In 2009 they were invited to the NIT, where\
      \ they advanced to the semifinals but were beaten by Penn State who went on\
      \ and beat Baylor in the championship. The 2010–11 team concluded its regular\
      \ season ranked number seven in the country, with a record of 25–5, Brey's fifth\
      \ straight 20-win season, and a second-place finish in the Big East. During\
      \ the 2014–15 season, the team went 32–6 and won the ACC conference tournament,\
      \ later advancing to the Elite 8, where the Fighting Irish lost on a missed\
      \ buzzer-beater against then undefeated Kentucky. Led by NBA draft picks Jerian\
      \ Grant and Pat Connaughton, the Fighting Irish beat the eventual national champion\
      \ Duke Blue Devils twice during the season. The 32 wins were the most by the\
      \ Fighting Irish team since 1908–09.\n\nNotre Dame has been successful in other\
      \ sports besides football, with an additional 14 national championships in various\
      \ sports. Three teams have won multiple national championships with the fencing\
      \ team leading them with seven, followed by the men's tennis and women's soccer\
      \ teams each with two. The men's cross country, men's golf, and women's basketball\
      \ teams have each won one in their histories.\n\nIn the first ten years that\
      \ Notre Dame competed in the Big East Conference its teams won a total of 64\
      \ championships. As of 2010, the women's swimming and diving team holds the\
      \ Big East record for consecutive conference championships in any sport with\
      \ 14 straight conference titles (1997–2010).\n\nThe Band of the Fighting Irish\
      \ is the oldest university band in continuous existence. It was formed in 1846.\
      \ The all-male Glee Club was formed in 1915. The Internationally recognized\
      \ \"Notre Dame Folk Choir\" was founded by Steven \"Cookie\" Warner in 1980.\n\
      \nThe \"Notre Dame Victory March\" is the fight song for the University of Notre\
      \ Dame. It was written by two brothers who were Notre Dame graduates. The Rev.\
      \ Michael J. Shea, a 1904 graduate, wrote the music, and his brother, John F.\
      \ Shea, who earned degrees in 1906 and 1908, wrote the original lyrics. The\
      \ lyrics were revised in the 1920s; it first appeared under the copyright of\
      \ the University of Notre Dame in 1928. The chorus is, \"Cheer cheer for old\
      \ Notre Dame, wake up the echos cheering her name. Send a volley cheer on high,\
      \ shake down the thunder from the sky! What though the odds be great or small,\
      \ old Notre Dame will win over all. While her loyal sons are marching, onward\
      \ to victory!\"\n\nThe chorus of the song is one of the most recognizable collegiate\
      \ fight songs in the United States, and was ranked first among fight songs by\
      \ Northern Illinois University Professor William Studwell, who remarked it was\
      \ \"more borrowed, more famous and, frankly, you just hear it more\".\n\nIn\
      \ the film \"Knute Rockne, All American\", Knute Rockne (played by Pat O'Brien)\
      \ delivers the famous \"Win one for the Gipper\" speech, at which point the\
      \ background music swells with the \"Notre Dame Victory March\". George Gipp\
      \ was played by Ronald Reagan, whose nickname \"The Gipper\" was derived from\
      \ this role. This scene was parodied in the movie \"Airplane!\" with the same\
      \ background music, only this time honoring George Zipp, one of Ted Striker's\
      \ former comrades. The song also was prominent in the movie \"Rudy\", with Sean\
      \ Astin as Daniel \"Rudy\" Ruettiger, who harbored dreams of playing football\
      \ at the University of Notre Dame despite significant obstacles.\n\nNotre Dame\
      \ alumni number near 120,000, and are members of 275 alumni clubs around the\
      \ world. Many alumni give yearly monetary support to the university, with a\
      \ school-record 53.2% giving some donation in 2006. Many buildings on campus\
      \ are named for those whose donations allowed their building, including residence\
      \ halls, classroom buildings, and the performing arts center.\n\nNotre Dame\
      \ alumni work in various fields. Alumni working in political fields include\
