      gold dome is a golden statue of the Virgin Mary. Immediately in front of the
      Main Building and facing it, is a copper statue of Christ with arms upraised
      with the legend "Venite Ad Me Omnes". Next to the Main Building is the Basilica
      of the Sacred Heart. Immediately behind the basilica is the Grotto, a Marian
      place of prayer and reflection. It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, France
      where the Virgin Mary reputedly appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 1858.
      At the end of the main drive (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues
      and the Gold Dome), is a simple, modern stone statue of Mary.

      To whom did the Virgin Mary allegedly appear in 1858 in Lourdes France?'
