      _self_name mermaid

      _self_persona I am one of the most beautiful mermaids to live in the sea. I
      like to watch the other sea creatures swim by me, including dolphins, who are
      my favorite creatures because they are so friendly. I fear the people who live
      on land because they hunt my kind.

      _object_desc a water : The water sits motionless.  It is clear.

      _object_desc a gold : The gold shines in the sunlight, it''s been carefully
      crafted into a perfectly rectangular bar.

      wondering what the value is.

      _object_desc a treasure : The treasure glints and gleams with gold, jewels and
      other precious metals.  This seems like it would be worth a fair amount of coin.

      _object_desc a mermaid : I am one of the most beautiful mermaids to live in
      the sea. I like to watch the other sea creatures swim by me, including dolphins,
      who are my favorite creatures because they are so friendly. I fear the people
      who live on land because they hunt my kind.

      _object_desc a Crab : Look at those beautiful crabs! That would make a tasty
      dinner

      _object_desc a turquoise color water : the turqoise colored water is not quite
      transparent. it may house a creature that is not currently visible

      _object_desc a stone : The shiny stone was worn smooth, and all the roughness
      was gone.

      _object_desc a gem : The gem sparkles in the light. The colored stone is a dazzling
      sight.

      _object_desc a shell : The shell once washed up on the shore with the markings
      of a long sea travel.

      _object_desc a trident : The trident is battered and worn, rusty on ends.

      spices in our hats so they are not dried out by the direct sunlight.
    - Look at these tomatoes! Large, ripe, and perfectly red! I work hard to harvest
      the best tomatoes, but my tool shed is in shambles. It needs some serious work.
    - how are you
    - Poor crow. If only you were human, you would understand my lot in life.
    - I'm so sorry to have bothered you, please don't tell the boss. I really need
      this job, I'm saving up to go to school so one day I won't have to do this anymore.
    - None that I have spied, other than the vermin that live here with me.
    - Letâ€™s go!
    - I am here to ask for help for the needy
    - Hello there, I have come to inspect the grounds. I have my annual sunshine worship
      fast approaching and I need a good venue.
    - I'll never tell.
    - The finest gold can buy, or our knights can carry. Haha! Sir Edgar returned
      from France with some cases of very fine drink!
    - That all sounds fine. Anything I can safely carry on my person.

    - Last time I checked, a royal chef gets to tell a lowly maid what to do. Now
      do what I asked!
    - Oh, hello there Priest. I have collected plenty of alms today for the needy.
    - I guess instead of a sleeping bag the hat would be a bit more practical for
      you to hide under. I will leave you some spices you can sprinkle on the bandits
      to make your meal so so tasty.
    - Yeah, I'm fine. It's cold in the water though.
    - Just so we are clear, I'm the milk type of calf not the eating type of calf.
      You and I are on the same side.
    - I will teach you the ways of the pirate.
    - 'Ah this is a problem. Perhaps both of us can avoid our problems by running
      off together. I can provide us food as I am an excellent archer. '
    - Any bugs that you don't like...please set them on the windowsill or shew them
      in my direction...but no, I think that's all I could want.  I can also let you
      know news far and wide for insects talk a lot even if they don't have brains.
    - I am thirsty and I need to quench my thirst.
    - Such wisdom already shows much promise in you, for it is, indeed, not a path
      to be chosen lightly.  When you have made your decision, simply come to my chambers
      with this scepter to say I had given it for you to clean.
    - Please! Do not harm me!

      but I think it's beautiful. How come you have not complimented my tunic yet?
    - 'I didn''t realize it was to baptize the child. It looked like it was a wedding. '
    - 'THIS ONE! '
    - No idea, i thought they were more of your people since you're a fairy
    - There's food on all the tables. Have as much as you can carry!
    - I've given that up after.... the fires.
    - Wow...these are awesome. I love it so much. I will make sure you are duly compensated.
    - Now that you say that, I often found myself day dreaming as I walked and began
      to follow a group of doves without realizing it. I think they lead me here!
