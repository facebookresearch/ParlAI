    - Good Evening. You must be the painter of this room.
    - Is someone here?
    - Is that an apple tree she's pointing at? Oh I can't believe it! This is like
      the best day ever!! OK LET'S RIDE HOLD ON LADY!! GIVE ME THAT BASKET I'M HOLDING
      ON TO IT!
    - I am sorry we do not have that here. You see I do not even have a wife yet....
      I have been searching...
    - Oh, have you seen my chambermaid.
    - Evil lurking? In such a tranquil lake house? Sure you're pulling my leg.
    - So what is it you are doing here in these dense forests. I came to collect grapes
      and berries for the sacrament and to meditate and save souls.
    - Oh, come on. I'm not that bad. I've got layers.
    - 'I just wanted some food. Everything looks great and this little rat is hungry '
    - Such a gentleman. Maybe I'll bring some of the other little ones next time.
    - Aye, you look experienced, but a man such as yerself shouldn't have to lower
      yourself as to watch yer back for such vile things. Tell you what, squire, me
      and my men can watch out for yer ship while ye tour the docks... fer a price!
    - Doesn't all this fish smell amazing?!
    - You really should stick to counting coppers because you are no detective. I
      know what you've been doing, and I know where the money is going. I'm here to
      end it. Right after I throw up ...
    - Remember what we fight for.
    - Are you sure that this is not the trick up your sleeve that you used to gain
      an unfair edge?
    - I can't give you a job, I'm just a kid. My mom gave me a pence to buy lunch.
      You and I can share.
    - I'm here cleaning up whatever I can of this mess. How about you?
    - Sounds good to me, dragon.
    - 'Ahhhh... I have one here for just such a cause. You must drink it at the stroke
      of midnight under a full moon. '
    - staring contest, go...

      _setting_name Castle Maids'' Room, Inside Castle

      _setting_desc Inside the maids room is dark and grey.  It is much different
      from the rest of the Castle which has grand walls and floors and paintings from
      famous painters around the wall.  The maid holds many secrets in this room.  One
      which is a secret door that holds paintings she should not have.

      _partner_name painter

      _self_name worker

      _self_persona I am a worker from a village up the river. I tie the logs our
      woodsmen fell into rafts, and steer them down to the next town for milling.
      I am hardworking and patient. I enjoy fishing off of the edge of the raft during
      quiet times on the raft.

      _object_desc a floor : THe floor is dusty and broken in several places. You
      don''t quite trust it will hold your full weight.

      _object_desc a brush : Upon close inspection, the brush is dainty and carved
      with roses.

      _object_desc a tape : The tape is rudimentary but does the job well of holding
      the bandage in place. You can see a sticky resin on one side of the material.

      _object_desc a paint brushes : The paint brush has a long handle and dry black
      bristles.

      _object_desc a fresh red paint : The paint is a bright red color and easy to
      apply on a surface.

      _object_desc a shirt : The shirt is tailored from finely woven cotton and is
      fastened up the front by a series of rounded buttons.

      _object_desc a Chain mail : The chain mail is heavy, but protective enough to
      be worn for battle.

      _object_desc a A quiver : The quiver contains a mess of arrows, its leather
      frame stretched from years of use.

    - Must be nice to have a steady income off of being here, I would come here everyday
      if I could afford to.
    - There are other ways of freeing me that are much easier and near foolproof.
    - Nurse! Have you seen my chambermaid?
    - Do you two know each other?
    - No! You are a frog! I can not marry a frog!
    - 'I have been invited to grand banquets here as I hold a powerful position in
      society. I have not seen the owners here in quite some time. '
    - Thank you for this good gift, priest. I'll love to keep it around for a bit.
    - I...used to be an Oarsman on one of the King's finest ships... We were attacked
      on both sides...I can still hear...no...
    - I hope that the king is paying you well this is some really fine work.  Don't
      overwork yourself now.
    - You could consider working it off, perhaps counting your steps for exercise
      purposes. Otherwise the armor would hardly fit.
    - I brought my pick and shovel with me, mind if I poke around as well?
    - Yes. 5 more days to the full moon.
    - Ha. Do you think I got to this rank by my own lucky stars? Besides, I have a
      prisoner in my tent. let me get him.
    - I should eat the nut before I go, just so the bird doesn't think I was declining
      its gift.
    - 'That was a very big mistake, foolish one '
    - Best wishes on the sea... steer your ship out to the point. I hear the fish
      are biting there.
    - From where did you get coal in a place like this, thief?
    - I am just a lowly worker. I think the red paint looks good. I can assist you
      with painting.
    - I don't suppose you know of a doctor that has dealt with magical sicknesses?
      She seems to have eaten a dark mushroom.
    - Again with the demands. My stew is the finest and I will not be rushed. If all
      you desire is a quick meal, perhaps you should seek elsewhere. If you would
      like the best, then I suggest you sit and offer some manners and patience.
