        have given nothing back to me!
      - I'm sure you are working on something very important, may I ask what it is?
      - I'll have to stop by! Have you always lived here in Dorwich?
      - Nope nothing is happening. Maybe it's in this leaf. Here, eat this!
      - Hello creature, are you friendly?  What are you doing here int he bazaar?
      - We are at the top of the tower, it is some way to where you want to be. Let
        me think..
      - I can  not help you blend in. But I would love to hear about your foreign
        polices from Slavic
      - What do you mean?
      - Hmm, it seems to be attracting the attention of flies and ants. Er, my arthritis
        seems to be acting up, my fingers have become rather stiff. Perhaps it would
        be best if you opened it.
      - I will see what I can find, is that the only request?
      - Ah, thank goodness you're here!  I've gotten, erm, a little turned around
        since I... well, I was robbed just a few hours again.
      - I think I'm just going to go for a swim while I am here! The water feels so
        refreshing. Care to joing?
      - You would make this ole' servants dreams come true!!! I would be so happy!!

      - which part of the village do you like the most apart from the room
      - That is of no import at the moment.  It is time for me to see the king...please
        be on your way so that I may be announced.
      - I’m looking for my dad
      - Halt there!  Who are you, and who let you into my castle?!  You have the look...
        the look of an assassin!  No, don't kill me, I'm too young to die!
      - No I just don't want any bandits to steal my spices from me.
      - Oh you scared me! I am a gravedigger but I live alone in solitary confinement
        in a dark and sad cemetery.
      - A poor excuse!
      - Ahh, Let's not make him too rusty.
      - So who's the suitor?
      - Yes of course! A fisherman like me always has a spare rod! Now take your pole
        and put a worm on the end!
      - Hey there. Don't often see a bride without a groom
      - That's fair enough, So what do you wanna talk about?
      - 'a small child who grew up in a nearby village. '
      - Who do you think you are to give me orders??? I only obey my boss
      - Oh trust me sister I am well aware.
      - Iron ore, for melting down and turning into shields. That's what I've been
        hired for anyway, but between you and me, I think there's something else going
        on.
      - So a bear is helping you with your economy? Interesting.
      - Yes, your majesty.  As you wish, your majesty.  I tremble before you.
      - Should we meet again, I am Arachnibald. What is your name?
