    text: 'One morning, Elena woke up, much like she did every day. She threw the
      covers on the floor and rolled out of bed, yawning hugely. She walked to the
      window and said, "Hello there, Mr. tree!" at the big tree in the yard. It waved
      its branches back at her. She walked over to her fish bowl next. "Hello there,
      Mr. Fish!" But wait. Where was Mr. Fish? The bowl was empty--oh, the rocks and
      water and tiny castle were all there alright, but the pretty blue fish with
      the long shiny tail was nowhere to be seen. Elena was very worried. She liked
      Mr. Fish very much. She looked all around her desk, but here wasn''t there.
      Then she looked on the floor behind the desk--and there he was! He was covered
      in dust bunnies and not moving. Elena picked him up and put him back in the
      bowl. And what do you know? He shook himself off and started swimming around
      again! multiple: What is the very first thing Elena does after waking up?'
