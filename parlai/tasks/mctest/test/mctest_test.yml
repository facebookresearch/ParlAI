    text: 'It was Sally''s birthday. She was very excited. She was going to have a
      sleepover at her house for her birthday. She invited all of her best friends.
      The party was at 1 on Saturday. Jessica, Erin, and Cathy all arrived at 1, but
      Jennifer was late. She did not come until 2, because she could not find her
      other shoe. The first thing they all did was go swimming in her pool. They had
      so much fun. They played with the foam noodles in the pool. Erin accidentally
      kicked Jennifer''s leg in the pool. After they swam, everyone rinsed off and
      went inside. They ate cake, opened presents, and watched TV. After it got dark,
      they ran up and down the stairway, played telephone, and told spooky stories.
      Sally tripped going down the stairs and hurt her foot, but it felt better soon
      after. Cathy got scared when they were telling stories, and wanted to call her
      mom to go home. The other girls told her that it is only a story. She felt better.
      They all fell asleep at 11. Sally was the first to wake up at 8 in the morning.
      She made pancakes for her and her friends. They all loved the pancakes, except
      Erin. She ate some fruit instead. At 10, all the girls went back home. Sally
      was happy that she had such a great birthday party. one: What time did the party
      start?'
