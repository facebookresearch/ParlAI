    text: "Pressuring Honey to take up teaching Ballet classes, her parents refuse\
      \ to help with the new dance studio. Honey gets a bank loan, and puts down a\
      \ deposit. Meanwhile, Honey pitches an idea to Ellis for Ginuwine's new video,\
      \ using the kids she teaches at the centre as the back up dancers, Ginuwine\
      \ acting like an urban Pied Piper. Gina's 25th birthday comes up, and Honey\
      \ makes plans to take her to Atlantic City, but Ellis convinces her to make\
      \ an appearance at a black and White party instead, where he subsequently makes\
      \ a drunken pass at her. She refuses his advances, slaps him on the face and\
      \ Michael begins to have a major outburst at Honey and Honey leaves the party.\
      \ Honey and the kids as background dancers dance for Ginuwine's new video but\
      \ Michael is not impressed and hires Katrina to be in Ginuwine's new video and\
      \ he fires her from Ginuwine's video, black balls her in the business, and installs\
      \ Katrina in her place. Her friendship with Gina, although strained, improves,\
      \ and she helps Honey realise she can still make her dreams come true. Honey\
      \ struggles to pay the down payment on the studio, and eventually comes up with\
      \ an idea to raise revenue. She holds a dance benefit, using an abandoned church\
      \ that will be torn down for the event. Honey spends time getting to know Raymond\
      \ and Benny, and is shocked to see Benny going down the wrong track. Any comparisons\
      \ between \"Honey\" and \"Glitter\" are probably due to both movies having script-work\
      \ by Kate Lanier (who, funnily enough, isn't listed on the completed movie)...\
      \ and, of course, to their having slightly similar plots. Except that \"Glitter\"\
      \ is likely to be more of a black mark on Mariah Carey's book than \"Honey\"\
      \ is on Jessica Alba's. This movie about a kind-hearted young woman in New York\
      \ who uses dancing to help the people in her neighbourhood (the people that\
      \ she meets when she's walking down the street... sorry, couldn't resist) and\
      \ who's plucked from a nightclub to become the Paula Abdul of the 21st century\
      \ - she even has a little mole on her face - is aptly named; it's as sweet-natured\
      \ as its title character and has little if any benefit on your system, except\
      \ to slip down nice and easy and leave not very much behind. It's filled with\
      \ all the realism you'd expect from the producer of \"Legally Blonde\" and \"\
      Josie and the Pussycats,\" but it's not quite as much fun as either. Part of\
      \ it is a personal thing (the Rodney Jerkins-executive produced music that permeates\
      \ the movie isn't my thing, rhythmic though it is), but the thin, originality-challenged\
      \ scripting and silly dialogue are more of a problem; when our bartender-by-night/dance-teacher-by-day\
      \ heroine tells a kid \"Your flava's hot\" it's a little embarrassing, although\
      \ in fairness \"Honey\"'s street talk doesn't make you wince as much as some\
      \ other examples of this kind of thing. To be honest, the movie pretty much\
      \ goes in one ear and out the other; there's not a single truly dramatic moment,\
      \ with the setbacks coming on cue (when Li'l Romeo's character gets arrested\
      \ it, and many other moments in the movie, plays like a less-than-brilliant\
      \ After School Special) and the characters are right out of Cliches Central,\
      \ from the almost saintly title character to the sexually predatory rival dancer.\
      \ (And note to the filmmakers: as anyone who's ever watched MTV, VH-1 et al\
      \ will confirm, music videos don't credit the choreographer on screen... regardless\
      \ of what the one that plays next to the movie's end credits might say.) But\
      \ it's impossible to really hate \"Honey\"; the movie's too harmless and good-tempered\
      \ for anyone to get into a hissyfit over its drawbacks, and though the R&B-flavoured\
      \ cameos mean a lot of people who see this movie will probably be going \"Who's\
      \ this Tweet person?\" Missy Elliott is genuinely funny in her very brief scenes.\
      \ The dancing's also good, which is one of the main reasons to go and see movies\
      \ like this; and though it doesn't actually seem to have anything like a narrative\
      \ drive (it just seems to end instead of climax), there have been worse movies\
      \ from music video directors, e. g. almost anything directed by Russell Mulcahy.\
      \ Oh yes, Jessica. She doesn't quite seem like the streetwise type, but she\
      \ isn't supposed to be; she looks the part and comes off reasonably well, as\
      \ well as having the edge over Jennifer Beals in \"Flashdance\" in that she\
      \ actually does most of her own dancing. This isn't really the best vehicle\
      \ for her, to be honest, but Jessica's an undeniable charmer on screen, and\
      \ far too sexy for this or anything she's been in (with the arguable exception\
      \ of \"Paranoid\") to be an unbearable experience. All she has to do is improve\
      \ her choice of scripts... I thought the acting was great but the movie was\
      \ over-long and needed a better ending. Just watched it and loved it! My understanding\
      \ is that it's very good. Oh, are you fo' real? Watchable for fans of the genre.\
      \ I agree, it's one of the gems that we get each year. It would have been impossible\
      \ for this or any movie to be as sweet as Jessica Alba, but that doesn't keep\
      \ it from trying. Is it better than Fish Tank? In my top 10 for sure. But you\
      \ have to see those other movies. I watch anime not whatever Honey is. Never\
      \ seen it. {} {} {} An attractive Jessica Alba and energetic dance numbers provide\
      \ some lift to this corny and formulaic movie. brings out the wholesome, affirmative\
      \ side of the hip-hop aesthetic without being overly preachy. \nI tend to agree\
      \ with NYT's review which says:"

    text: "Ellie (Queen Latifah) and Manny (Ray Romano) are expecting their first\
      \ child, and Manny is obsessed with making life perfect and safe for the family,\
      \ since his first experiences as a husband and father went bad when his family\
      \ were killed by hunters. At the same time, Diego (Denis Leary) finds himself\
      \ unable to catch a cocky gazelle (Bill Hader) he has been stalking and decides\
      \ to leave the herd, believing that he is losing his predatory nature as a tiger.\
      \ Sid (John Leguizamo) grows jealous of Manny and Ellie and adopts three apparently\
      \ abandoned eggs that he finds in an icy underground cavern and call them Eggbert,\
      \ Shelly, and Yoko. Manny tells him to put them back, but Sid instead looks\
      \ after the eggs, which hatch into baby Tyrannosaurus the next morning. Although\
      \ Sid tries his best to raise the three dinosaurs, their rambunctious behavior\
      \ scares away all the other animals young and ruins a playground Manny built\
      \ for Ellies baby. A female Tyrannosaurus, Momma, whose eggs Sid stole, soon\
      \ returns and carries both Sid and her young underground, with Diego in pursuit.\
      \ Manny, Ellie, Crash, and Eddie (Seann William Scott, Josh Peck) follow as\
      \ well and discover that the icy cavern leads to a vast jungle populated by\
      \ dinosaurs thought to be extinct. Here, an Ankylosaurus threatens the herd\
      \ despite Diegos efforts to fend it off; they are saved from a further crowd\
      \ of angry reptiles by an insane, one-eyed weasel named Buckminster, or Buck\
      \ (Simon Pegg). Buck has been living in this jungle for some time and is chasing\
      \ Rudy (a huge albino Baryonyx), intending to avenge the eye he lost to it.\
      \ He agrees to lead the herd through the jungles perils to Lava Falls, where\
      \ Momma has taken Sid and her babies. My wife and I attended an early press\
      \ screening for the third Ice Age installment two weeks ago and had a wonderful\
      \ time. The film easily tops the second outing of the series, and is right on\
      \ par with the first - with just the right mixture of new characters and settings\
      \ vs. the older ones we've all grown to love (especially Scrat. I can watch\
      \ a whole movie with this guy). This time around, Manny and Ellie are expecting\
      \ a baby mammoth, something that leads to unexpected responds from Diego and\
      \ Sid. When Sid decides to become a parent himself in return, he steals three\
      \ giant eggs he accidentally bumps into, only to later realize they're dinosaur\
      \ eggs that belong to a pretty angry mother. When mother-dinosaur kidnaps Sid,\
      \ it's up to Manny and friends to return him home safely. Adventures ensue as\
      \ they find out that underneath their icy world lives a land filled with enormous\
      \ and sometimes menacing dinosaurs, one which our friends would need to cross\
      \ in order to rescue Sid. Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is cute but not insulting,\
      \ the visuals are stunning and if you forgive the obvious historical loophole\
      \ (there were no dinosaurs during the Ice Age) you can actually have quite a\
      \ good time. The dinosaurs add a lot to the plot, and there's actually a very\
      \ cool, nice sense of adventure throughout the film, one that was somewhat missing\
      \ (in my opinion) from the previous installment. All this adds to a fun and\
      \ thrilling experience - alongside the visuals, jokes and general good atmosphere.\
      \ To sum things up - Ice Age 3 is an above average animated film, that'll appeal\
      \ to grown-ups and kids alike. I gave it 9 out of 10. Ice Age 3 delivers the\
      \ goods, and appeals to grown-ups and kids alike. Ice Age 3 is the return of\
      \ true family films. A Joyous Delight. I liked the one in which all are fighting\
      \ with big dinosaur. My favorite character was sid. I think it was really funny.\
      \ Do you remember what came out from eggs? much more of an emphasis on action\
      \ in this nicely crafted, fast-paced sequel. film's animation art is Seuss-imaginative.\
      \ the flatness of the story and indifferent voicework all the more obvious.\
      \ \nWhat do you think about the characters in this movie?"

    text: "When Beckham tries to hustle him further, James is amused and tells him\
      \ he can keep the money if he's able to block a shot at the makeshift goal area\
      \ Beckham has set up. Beckham blocks the shot and James agrees to buy another\
      \ movie from him, mildly threatening him if it's defective. The team goes out\
      \ to the desert to detonate some of the explosives they've collected on missions.\
      \ As they prepare to explode another bomb, James stops Sanborn to briefly drive\
      \ down to the blast zone to get the gloves he left there. While he's gone, Sanborn\
      \ tells Eldridge that, with the dangerous nature of the explosives they detonate\
      \ in the desert, it would be easy to \"frag\" him by exploding the bomb while\
      \ James is down there and claiming it was accidental. Sanborn seems pretty intent\
      \ on doing so but Eldridge convinces him not to. While heading back to the city,\
      \ the team sees two SUVs parked on their route. They approach them and the occupants\
      \ standing around as if they were any other threat. The men standing near the\
      \ vehicles quickly obey Sanborn and his team, dropping their weapons. One of\
      \ the men reveals himself to be a British commando and the bomb unit relaxes.\
      \ The Hurt Locker is a serious character study and a taut, suspenseful action\
      \ thriller at once. The subject matter itself - the work of a bomb expert, possibly\
      \ one of the most nerve-racking jobs on the planet - yields most of the suspense\
      \ but Bigelow manages to squeeze out every bit of tension of the premise. This\
      \ film to me was very apolitical - though set in Iraq, it is distinguished from\
      \ most of the Iraq-themed war films in that it concentrates much more on the\
      \ job itself than the political environment. Iraq seemed more like a backdrop\
      \ - any other war would do, The Hurt Locker does not preach about this one specifically.\
      \ The story is deeply emotional, depicting a thoroughly disturbed individual's\
      \ life in hell. Jeremy Renner gives an incredibly powerful performance as an\
      \ EOD officer completely hooked on adrenaline stemming from his everyday close\
      \ shaves with death. All aspects of film-making are top-notch, from the brilliantly\
      \ subversive screenplay through vivid cinematography, masterful directing and\
      \ perfectly paced editing. In its storytelling the filmmakers wisely break with\
      \ traditional Hollywood narrative techniques. There is no clear antagonist,\
      \ no rising action, no obvious character development and no climax. And yet\
      \ the film manages to be more interesting, tense and suspenseful than any Hollywood\
      \ action thriller I've seen in years while making a powerful, yet subtle statement\
      \ about the insane addiction that is war. Kudos for everyone involved for making\
      \ this film without compromising. This is pure quality, cinematic storytelling\
      \ at its best, a thinking man's actioner. He was wrong about the sitting around\
      \ joking about our dicks part. That is literally 90% of what we do. IED calls\
      \ are not excluded. A Perfectly Shattering Film Going Experience. The work of\
      \ a master filmmaker. The Brilliant Explosion Of Kathryn Bigelow. I don't know,\
      \ what's worse, a movie made by civilians trying to take war seriously, or a\
      \ movie like Battle: Los Angeles that shamelessly exploits the \"Marines are\
      \ real life GI Joes! Look at all this cool shit!\" nature of recruiting stupid\
      \ teenagers? Thanks a lot for posting this. It's interesting to know how an\
      \ actual vet feels about the movie. a leading contender for Academy Awards,\
      \ uses the barely perceptible ringing of tinnitus to amp up the tension. it\
      \ confronts the fact that men often take great pleasure in war. a totally immersive,\
      \ off-the-charts high-anxiety experience from beginning to end. its fuzzy (and\
      \ hardly original) psychology. signs of artificially straining for character\
      \ depth. My favorite character was Sergeant First Class William James. My favorite\
      \ character was Sergeant James because he wasn't a cliche character. My favorite\
      \ character was William James (Jeremy Renner) I liked the one in which James\
      \ begins his second tour at the end of the movie because he becomes too bored\
      \ with civillian life. I liked the one in which Sergeant James is relaxing back\
      \ in the bunk. I like the one which has the main character pulling out some\
      \ bombs out of the ground. I think it was a great movie; very well done! I think\
      \ it was enjoyable but not particularly rewatchable. I think i was a great film,\
      \ suspenseful and action packed. How does Lieutenant Colonel John Cambridge\
      \ die? Do you remember what happened to the psychiatrist? Do you remember the\
      \ type of cell phone the first enemy is using? \nWhat do you think about the\
      \ movie?"
