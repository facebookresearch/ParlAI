    text: 'Dracula (voiced by Adam Sandler) is the owner and creator of Hotel Transylvania,
      a five-star resort where the world''s monsters can be safe from human civilization.
      Dracula invites some of the most famous monsters like Frankenstein (Kevin James)
      and his wife Eunice (Fran Drescher), Murray the Mummy (Cee Lo Green), Wayne
      and Wanda Werewolf (Steve Buscemi and Molly Shannon), Griffin the Invisible
      Man (David Spade), Bigfoot, Steve the Blob, and other monsters to celebrate
      the 118th birthday of his daughter Mavis (voiced by Selena Gomez). However,
      Mavis prefers to explore the outside world with her father''s permission, but
      the village he directs her to is actually an elaborate deception to convince
      her of the threat of humans enough to coax her back. However, this charade inadvertently
      attracts the attention of an ordinary young traveler named Jonathan (voiced
      by Andy Samberg) who was exploring the surrounding forest and followed the staff
      to the hotel. Once Jonathan enters the hotel, Dracula frantically attempts to
      hide him from the patrons such as disguising him as a Flesh Golem named Johnny-stein
      with the later hasty cover story of being a relative of one of Frank''s body
      parts. Eventually, Jonathan is discovered by Mavis and company, forcing Dracula
      to claim he is going to arrange Mavis'' birthday party with a young perspective.
      In doing so, Jonathan manages to charm everyone at the hotel, especially Mavis.
      Eventually, even Dracula begins to like the human taking him into his confidence
      about his family''s traumatic past after the vampire notices the young man knows
      something about them in a respectful manner. Unfortunately, Chef Quasimodo Wilson
      (Jon Lovitz) realizes Jonathan is human and captures him to cook him, forcing
      Dracula to directly intervene by magically freezing the chef. Eventually, the
      birthday party happens and it is a raucous success until Dracula freaks out
      when Mavis and Jonathan have an innocent kiss. I went to see Hotel Transylvania
      last night in a small group of adults aged 24-30 and I LMAO as did the others.
      The theater was packed with little children who mostly laughed at not really
      funny parts and adults who laughed when the children were quite silent. The
      story is about Count Dracule trying to raise his only child safe and sound away
      from terrifying humans and invites all the monsters to his hotel to relax and
      celebrate his very young daughter''s 118th birthday which is accompanied by
      a surprise visitor! This is a really funny movie with a simple predictable story
      line and tons of characters that you will love. My favorites were the zombies
      who were the hotel staff and it took them forever to finish a task. I recommend
      this movie to anyone who like monsters (so afraid of a little boy licking ice-cream)and
      want to have a good laugh and take a break from Disney. Very enjoyable experience.
      I absolutely loved the first one! Can''t wait to see this one as well. Thanks.
      HT 2 all the way! <3. One of the best (funniest) animations I''ve seen in years!
      Mel brooks as: wtf op. Would this be appropriate for a four-year-old who hasn''t
      seen the first one? Saw it, I liked it a nice little kids film. Wasn''t a fan
      of it, it shouldn''t have gotten a sequel Edit; downvoted for having an opinion,
      thanks reddit. Let the child in you enjoy this adventure. Went in with low expectations,
      ended up enjoying it a lot. My favorite scene was where the human and the vampire
      fell in love and had a half breed baby. My favorite character was the father
      vampire. I think the movie was cute and appropriate for kids. Do you remember
      when the father switched from being pleasant and extremely volatile? box office

    text: 'On their next date, Jay and Hugh are having sex in his car, when he suddenly
      chloroforms her. When Jay awakens, she is tied up in a wheelchair. Hugh is there
      and he explains to her that when they had sex, he passed on a curse to her.
      This curse is an entity that can only be seen by the person with the curse (which
      is now Jay). The entity can take the form of any person and will follow her
      repeatedly at a walking pace. If IT catches her, it will kill her and will go
      after the previous person who had the curse (which would now be Hugh) to get
      them to pass the curse on to someone else. It is implied that Hugh had slept
      with the young woman from the beginning of the film, but since IT caught her,
      IT is continuing to stalk Hugh until he passes the curse on to someone else,
      hence why he slept with Jay. At that moment, Hugh spots a naked woman walking
      towards them. Jay and Hugh then flee. Hugh drops Jay off at home and continues
      to flee. Inspired by 70''s and 80''s horror, it follows is a refreshing psychological
      horror film with a simple premise and a chilling concept. The cinematography
      is electrifying, every shot is beautiful and the score holds brilliance, it
      carries a very obvious John Carpenter vibe to it. The tension is raw, avoiding
      cheap jump scares and relies on music. Its eerie atmosphere is extremely effective
      keeping you inches above your seat for the majority of the runtime. The characters
      are interesting, providing depth and emotional attachment, most modern horror
      films seem to forget the importance of character development, its nice to see
      the genre hasn''t completely lost it yet. There are several jumps scares, but
      they work, as they are not carried with unnecessary piecing music jolts but
      with the use of disturbing and sudden imagery. The only errors I could detect
      were the unconventional editing style, the transitions were a little dodgy lacking
      fluency, this left the film to appear choppy at times but this flaw can be easily
      forgiven. Its outstanding cinematography and soundtrack make up for this. The
      film leaves a daunting stain of disturbing after effects that follow you for
      a long while, with a constant reminder to always check behind your back. An
      exceptional low budget indie horror film, strongly recommend. It Follows (2014)
      It Follows breathes new life into a dying genre. A Modern Horror Classic. Great
      film. John Carpenter/80s throwback feel as many here are saying and the score
      is something like Drive meets The Shining. creepy, mesmerizing exercise in minimalist
      horror. {{cite web| url=http://www. vice. com/read/it-follows-is-the-new-horror-movie-about-a-sexually-transmitted-monster-456|
      title=''It Follows'' Is the Best Horror Film in Years| work=VICE}} and critic
      Mark Frauenfelder called it. My favorite character was Jay Height. My favorite
      character was Paul because he seemed so innocent and was in love with Jay. My
      favorite character was Jamie. I liked the one in which Hugh and Jay have sex
      in a car. I liked the one in which Jay swims to the boat hoping to finally end
      what is following her. I liked the one in which they lure it into the pool and
      try to electrocute it. I think it was gripping and psychologically intense.
      I think it was a great horror movie. I think it was creepy and clever. Do you
      remember where Jay first saw the supernatural being? Do you remember who was
      Paul''s first kiss? Do you remember how to get rid of "it"? box office $14,673,301
