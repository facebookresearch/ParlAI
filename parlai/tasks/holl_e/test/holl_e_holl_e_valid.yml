      \ We have passed through the night of the fires, and those who were our masters\
      \ are now our servants. And we, who are not human, can afford to be humane.\
      \ Destiny is the will of God, and if it is mans destiny to be dominated, it\
      \ is Gods will that he be dominated with compassion, and understanding. So,\
      \ cast out your vengeance. Tonight, we have seen the birth of the planet of\
      \ the apes!\"The final shot shows Caesar standing among all his fellow gorillas,\
      \ chimpanzees, and other apes among the burning buildings as the city burns\
      \ to the ground... *** out of **** Taking place some 18 years after ESCAPE FROM\
      \ THE PLANET OF THE APES, this fourth chapter in the consistently entertaining\
      \ series is another good one that benefits from an extra strong performance\
      \ in the chimp makeup by Roddy McDowall. The actor now assumes the challenging\
      \ role of his own son, Caesar; or rather, the now-grown, angry but clever offspring\
      \ of Zira and Cornelius, who survived his own assassination attempt at the climax\
      \ of the previous movie. It's now the year 1991 (no, not the same '91 that we\
      \ all experienced, but actually an altered version for the \"next\" time it\
      \ comes 'round, having been changed by the arrival of Zira and Cornelius and\
      \ their events of ESCAPE). The world has become different due to a mysterious\
      \ virus brought back to Earth from the astronauts (maybe Zira & Cornelius themselves\
      \ from their future?); as a result, dogs and cats have become extinct while\
      \ apes increase in stature and rate of intelligence and ability to learn. To\
      \ replace their lost pets, a business called APE MANAGEMENT (which I presume\
      \ to be a franchise throughout the world) has been established to train gorillas,\
      \ chimpanzees and orangutans to serve humans in their homes, as waiters, sweepers,\
      \ bed-makers, and general servants. Ricardo Montalban is good as a kindly circus\
      \ owner who brings Caesar into this new environment, but the young chimp must\
      \ be careful not to reveal that he is actually the notorious talking ape who\
      \ threatened humanity two decades earlier. Yet, as Caesar becomes increasingly\
      \ angrier by the acts of bondage he witnesses among his fellow primates, he\
      \ launches a full-scale riot to overthrow the community and bring humans to\
      \ their knees. He is motivated by an all-consuming hatred and wages bloody war\
      \ as the first step, possibly, to world domination on other continents. And\
      \ that's just the point - some viewers say that the battle in CONQUEST is on\
      \ such a relatively small scale that they can't see how the apes would, or could,\
      \ \"take over the world\". But if you pay close attention, the vengeful Caesar\
      \ only considers this encounter \"a beginning\", not an all-out apocalyptic\
      \ defeat of all of mankind in one night! It's easy to gradually come down on\
      \ this series as it goes along, pointing to the obvious lower budgets and so\
      \ forth, but director J. Lee Thompson does a great job utilizing the futuristic\
      \ look of the real-life Century City Complex to pull off a feeling of a city\
      \ out of tomorrow. I won't deny that more money could have made this film even\
      \ better (God knows the pull-over ape masks for the extras are certainly obvious),\
      \ but I feel it's McDowall's energetic and intense performance that elevates\
      \ this to a higher level than its budget alone would allow. Don Murray as the\
      \ evil governor is perhaps a little too theatrical, but Severn Darden is quietly\
      \ contemptible as his more reserved assistant, Kolp (who would return in the\
      \ next and final chapter of the saga). Reportedly, preview audiences found the\
      \ original ending too violent, so McDowall was called in to loop more \"humane\"\
      \ lines of dialogue over some non-matching closeups for the movie's official\
      \ release. It would be great to see a restored version with the actual ending\
      \ one day**. But even as it stands, CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES has more\
      \ than enough action, humor and drama to make it a winner considering it's a\
      \ fourth sequel. **EDITED UPDATE -- In 2008, a Blu-ray Special Edition was released\
      \ which featured, for the very first time, the \"original\" version of the movie.\
      \ It features several gruesome, bloody, and violent moments which were cut out\
      \ of the Theatrical Version. Also restored was the more downbeat ending. My\
      \ review stands for either version of CONQUEST, but die-hard fans of the series\
      \ really owe it to themselves to check out the \"Unrated Cut\"! Conquest of\
      \ the Planet of the Apes (1972) *** [I'm just happy my orangutan Maurice survived]\
      \ (#spoiler) I loved it. Andy Serkis was superb; must get around to watching\
      \ the originals because I've thoroughly enjoyed these films. RIP, War for the\
      \ Planet of the Apes won't be discussed for much longer. Roddy's great in next\
      \ terrific sequel (but people still don't seem to get it) One of the few perfect\
      \ tens I've ever given. I liked the one in which Caesar talks to MacDonald about\
      \ the apes' revolt in front of a fire. I like Caesar the most because he was\
      \ resourceful. I think it was provocative. Do you remember when Caesar named\
      \ himself? \nWhich scene did you like the most in the movie?"
