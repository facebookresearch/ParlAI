      Elon Musk first described his idea for a futuristic transportation system that
      would send passenger pods through tubes at speeds of hundreds of miles an hour
      back in 2013. At the time, the idea of actually building and operating a so-called
      "hyperloop" seemed far-fetched, to say the least.

      But hyperloops are no longer quite so hypothetical. A handful of firms are now
      competing to develop the necessary technology. And in addition to designing
      the magnetically levitated pods and testing them on small-scale tracks, the
      firms are taking preliminary steps to set up hyperloop routes in the U.S. and
      abroad.

      Hyperloop is essentially a train system that Musk calls  a cross between a Concorde,
      a railgun, and an air hockey table . It s based on the very high-speed transit
      (VHST) system proposed in 1972, which combines a magnetic levitation train and
      a low pressure transit tube. It evolves some of the original ideas of VHST,
      but it still uses tunnels and pods or capsules to move from place to place.

      Hyperloop Outperforms All Other Modes of Transport.

      Linear induction motors, axial compressors, and air bearings enable full-scale
      Hyperloop Pods to sustain speeds upwards of 760 mph inside partially evacuated
      tubes with a fraction of the aerodynamic losses experienced by planes, trains,
      and automobiles. The result is a mass transportation system with faster travel
      times, greater energy efficiency, and lower costs than any previous mode of
      transportation.

      Elon Musk s Hyperloop Alpha, a white paper released in 2013, was the first introduction
      to the Hyperloop concept and an effort to inspire a transportation revolution.
      Connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco at speeds up to 760 mph with total
      construction and operation costs orders of magnitude lower than the California
      High Speed Rail, Hyperloop Alpha readily exceeds traditional transportation
      solutions in both performance and value.

      Five minute station times, top speeds of 760 mph, isolated internal tube environments,
      and a capacity of 840 passengers per hour make the Hyperloop the fastest, safest,
      and most efficient mass transportation system ever proposed.

      With approximately 594 acres of solar cell coverage on top of the tubes, the
      all-electric Hyperloop is completely self powering during peak solar activity,
      ensuring a responsible and reliable transportation solution for the future.

      The LA-SF Hyperloop offers the fastest ground transportation ever proposed at
      a total cost of just $6 billion, where as the California High Speed Rail project
      costs an estimated $68 billion and has a maximum speed of only 220 mph.

      Elon Musk s original proposed Hyperloop Alpha, which runs in a 2.23m (7ft4 )
      diameter tube, at an absolute pressure of 100 Pa ( 1/1000 atmosphere). It used
      air bearing skis, with an air compressor to provide air. Acceleration thrust
      is from linear motors on limited sections of the track.

      Cheetah is a design variation released by Richard Macfarlane in January 2014,
      with a number of changes to simplify and solve problems.

      Wheels are used which provide traction. Steam from the cooling system is ejected
      into the tube, increasing the speed of sound, and reducing aerodynamic drag.

      The pod is 3 seats wide, and the tube is now 2.6 - 2.8m diameter. The seats
      are in 3 seating modules which roll out at the station.

      Maglev and air bearing skis

      Hyperloop Alpha originally proposed air ski bearings for levitation. But there
      may be insufficient airflow in the near-vacuum. See air skis here.

      The tube in the 2016 Pod Competition has an aluminium plate for maglev, but
      any plate maglev will suffer high drag. See passive maglev plate here. See Arx

    - 'Musk''s Hyperloop math doesn''t add up

      TransitBy Matt Johnson (Editorial Board Alum) August 14, 2013194

      On Monday, entrepreneur Elon Musk announced plans to build

      a design for a super-fast tube train connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco.
      He believes his plan will obviate the need for the California High-Speed Rail.
      Unfortunately, his math doesn''t add up.

      The "Hyperloop" would be a pair of tubes stretching from Los Angeles to the
      Bay Area. Pods within these tubes would travel at up to 760 mph, making the
      trip between California''s largest metro areas in 35 minutes. Musk says he became
      motivated to invent this technology because he grew disenchanted with the California
      High-Speed Rail project''s expense ($53 billion in 2013 dollars) and sloth (it
      will travel at an average of 168 mph).

      Musk claims the Hyperloop system could be built for just $6 billion, 10% of
      the cost of HSR. Some are wondering if this is a serious proposal or a ploy
      intended to derail the California High-Speed Rail project. Evidence seems to
      point to the latter. After all, the guy proposing this revolution in transit
      owns a car company.

      The Hyperloop concept has gotten a lot of press over the past few days. It seems
      to have inspired the masses like an idea out of Popular Mechanics. And it may
      very well be possible to build a system much like this one. Perhaps one day
      in my lifetime, people will be taking Hyperloops all over the nation.

      Hyperloop Outperforms All Other Modes of Transport.

      Linear induction motors, axial compressors, and air bearings enable full-scale
      Hyperloop Pods to sustain speeds upwards of 760 mph inside partially evacuated
      tubes with a fraction of the aerodynamic losses experienced by planes, trains,
      and automobiles. The result is a mass transportation system with faster travel
      times, greater energy efficiency, and lower costs than any previous mode of
      transportation.

      Elon Musk s Hyperloop Alpha, a white paper released in 2013, was the first introduction
      to the Hyperloop concept and an effort to inspire a transportation revolution.
      Connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco at speeds up to 760 mph with total
      construction and operation costs orders of magnitude lower than the California
      High Speed Rail, Hyperloop Alpha readily exceeds traditional transportation
      solutions in both performance and value.

      Five minute station times, top speeds of 760 mph, isolated internal tube environments,
      and a capacity of 840 passengers per hour make the Hyperloop the fastest, safest,
      and most efficient mass transportation system ever proposed.

      With approximately 594 acres of solar cell coverage on top of the tubes, the
      all-electric Hyperloop is completely self powering during peak solar activity,
      ensuring a responsible and reliable transportation solution for the future.

      The LA-SF Hyperloop offers the fastest ground transportation ever proposed at
      a total cost of just $6 billion, where as the California High Speed Rail project
      costs an estimated $68 billion and has a maximum speed of only 220 mph.

      waves, and out-competing air travel are similar.
    - 'Hyperloop

      A Hyperloop is a proposed mode of passenger and/or freight transportation, first
      used to describe an open-source vactrain design released by a joint team from
      Tesla and SpaceX. Drawing heavily from Robert Goddard''s vactrain, a hyperloop
      comprises a sealed tube or system of tubes through which a pod may travel free
      of air resistance or friction conveying people or objects at high speed while
      being very efficient.

      Elon Musk''s version of the concept, first publicly mentioned in 2012, incorporates
      reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on air bearings driven
      by linear induction motors and air compressors.

      The Hyperloop Alpha concept was first published in August 2013, proposing and
      examining a route running from the Los Angeles region to the San Francisco Bay
      Area roughly following the Interstate 5 corridor. The paper conceived of a hyperloop
      system that would propel passengers along the route at an average speed of around
      , with a top speed of , allowing for a travel time of 35 minutes, which is considerably
      faster than current rail or air travel times. Preliminary cost estimates for
      this LA-SF suggested route were included in the white paper-- for a passenger-only
      version, and for a somewhat larger-diameter version transporting passengers
      and vehicles--although transportation analysts had doubts that the system could
      be constructed on that budget; some analysts claimed that the Hyperloop would
      be several billion dollars overbudget, taking into consideration construction,
      development and operation costs.

      The Hyperloop concept has been explicitly "open-sourced" by Musk and SpaceX,
      and others have been encouraged to take the ideas and further'

      republished keeping in mind the announcement of Virgin Hyperloop One announcement
      to begin an operational hyperloop route between Mumbai and Pune, at the ongoing
      Magnetic Maharashtra Summit.

      Elon Musk s Hyperloop transit system idea was announced in 2012 promising a
      pneumatic tube transportation system. The average speed that these Hyperloop
      pods are expected to achieve is 970 kmph with a top speed of 1200 kmph. This
      brings with it the promise of covering long distances in a matter of minutes.

      Since 2012, the Hyperloop concept has been taken forward by companies such as
      Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) and Hyperloop One. Apart from these
      there are many independent entities working on the different aspects of this
      transportation systems such as the pods, the tubes and so on.

      Both HTT and Hyperloop One have expressed interest in getting the Hyperloop
      project to India. HTT chairman Bibop Gabriele Gresta has proposed a loop between
      Mumbai and Pune in a meeting with transport minister Nitin Gadkari. Hyperloop
      One, on the other hand, has proposed a country-wide network which connects all
      the major cities in India.

        at the ongoing Magnetic Maharashtra Summit.

        Elon Musk s Hyperloop transit system idea was announced in 2012 promising
        a pneumatic tube transportation system. The average speed that these Hyperloop
        pods are expected to achieve is 970 kmph with a top speed of 1200 kmph. This
        brings with it the promise of covering long distances in a matter of minutes.

        Since 2012, the Hyperloop concept has been taken forward by companies such
        as Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) and Hyperloop One. Apart from
        these there are many independent entities working on the different aspects
        of this transportation systems such as the pods, the tubes and so on.

        Both HTT and Hyperloop One have expressed interest in getting the Hyperloop
        project to India. HTT chairman Bibop Gabriele Gresta has proposed a loop between
        Mumbai and Pune in a meeting with transport minister Nitin Gadkari. Hyperloop
        One, on the other hand, has proposed a country-wide network which connects
        all the major cities in India.

    - 'Great News for Everyone! Elon Musk Is Building a Hyperloop

      Elon Musk is back in the loop.

      Four years after encouraging anyone and everyone to try making his crazy hyperloop
      idea work, the Silicon Valley titan has decided he s not too busy to do it himself
      after all. You could see this coming last month, of course. That s when Musk
      announced his tunneling outfit, the Boring Company, received  verbal government
      approval  to dig a hyperloop tunnel between New York and Washington, DC. When
      WIRED asked Musk via Twitter who might build the hyperloop that would fill that
      tunnel, he replied,  the Boring Company.

      Speculation ramped up last week when Bloomberg, citing  sources close to Musk,  reported
      on his plans. On Monday, a spokesperson for the Boring Company confirmed it
      to WIRED.

      At the Boring Company, we plan to build low-cost, fast-to-dig tunnels that will
      house new high-speed transportation systems,  the spokesperson wrote in a statement.  Most
      will be standard pressurized tunnels with electric skates going 125+ mph. For
      long-distance routes in straight lines, such as NY to DC, it will make sense
      to use pressurized pods in a depressurized tunnel to allow speeds up to approximately
      600+ mph (aka Hyperloop).

    - 'Richard Branson Wants To Build A High-Speed Hyperloop In India

      The proposed route between Mumbai and Pune could cut travel time from over three
      hours to 25 minutes.

      Richard Branson s project, Virgin Hyperloop One, seeks to decrease travel time
      using vacuum-based underground tunnels.

      British billionaire Richard Branson has announced plans to build a high-speed
      shuttle in India that could potentially revolutionize travel in the country.

      The proposed hyperloop route between Mumbai and Pune, two major cities in the
      western state of Maharashtra, would reduce travel time from over three hours
      by train to just 25 minutes, according to a Virgin press release.

      Branson, co-founder of the British multinational conglomerate, signed a preliminary
      agreement with Maharashtra''s government on Sunday, the Press Trust of India
      reports. The project will now undergo an extensive feasibility study.

      "I believe Virgin Hyperloop One could have the same impact upon India in the
      21st century as trains did in the 20th century," Branson said in the press release.
      "The Pune-Mumbai route is an ideal first corridor as part of a national hyperloop
      network that will dramatically reduce travel times between most of India''s
      major cities to under two hours."

      A post shared by HyperloopOne (@hyperloopone) on Feb 17, 2018 at 9:26am PST

      The hyperloop will also connect passengers to the proposed Navi Mumbai International
      Airport, which is being built near Mumbai. Branson estimated that the shuttle
      would support 150 million passenger trips per year and "create a thriving, competitive
      megaregion."

      Entrepreneur Elon Musk first published a white paper outlining his vision for
      a vacuum-based, high-speed, underground shuttle system, or hyperloop,'
    - 'Hyperloop

      A Hyperloop is a proposed mode of passenger and/or freight transportation, first
      used to describe an open-source vactrain design released by a joint team from
      Tesla and SpaceX. Drawing heavily from Robert Goddard''s vactrain, a hyperloop
      comprises a sealed tube or system of tubes through which a pod may travel free
      of air resistance or friction conveying people or objects at high speed while
      being very efficient.

      Elon Musk''s version of the concept, first publicly mentioned in 2012, incorporates
      reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on air bearings driven
      by linear induction motors and air compressors.

      The Hyperloop Alpha concept was first published in August 2013, proposing and
      examining a route running from the Los Angeles region to the San Francisco Bay
      Area roughly following the Interstate 5 corridor. The paper conceived of a hyperloop
      system that would propel passengers along the route at an average speed of around
      , with a top speed of , allowing for a travel time of 35 minutes, which is considerably
      faster than current rail or air travel times. Preliminary cost estimates for
      this LA-SF suggested route were included in the white paper-- for a passenger-only
      version, and for a somewhat larger-diameter version transporting passengers
      and vehicles--although transportation analysts had doubts that the system could
      be constructed on that budget; some analysts claimed that the Hyperloop would
      be several billion dollars overbudget, taking into consideration construction,
      development and operation costs.

      The Hyperloop concept has been explicitly "open-sourced" by Musk and SpaceX,
      and others have been encouraged to take the ideas and further'

        about our approach is that we introduced an interdisciplinary, collaborative
        and participatory approach to developing a Hyperloop in Colorado.

        We asked ourselves and hundreds of Coloradans, what if we could help design
        this project in a way that is more human-centered? To design it in a way that
        will help the communities and not hurt them.

        The Hyperloop is all about connection. It is about eliminating borders and
        going beyond the limitations of time and space. It is meant to empower communities
        and that''s why we wanted to incorporate these future users.

        We used social media and surveys to gather information about how Coloradans
        might use a Front Range Hyperloop. Though these surveys we found:

        Equal interest in a Northern route from Denver to Fort Collins as well as
        a southern route from Denver to Pueblo.

        Hyperloop construction would benefit Colorado infrastructure, energy and technology
        sectors as well as tourism and quality of life measurements. There was special
        interest in connecting Hyperloop with recreational areas like National Parks,
        ski and rafting.

        Transport Canada is officially funding a study of the hyperloop train: an
        electric tunnel that will be able to take passengers from Toronto to Montreal
        in just 45 minutes.

        The government agency has announced that it s looking for researchers to look
        into the new transportation method, which is still in prototype mode.

        Transport Canada released a call out for consultants who can gauge the safety
        of hyperloop technology, as well as its cost-effectiveness in comparison to
        high-speed rail.

        The Elon Musk-introduced tech, which originally came via American company
        Virgin Hyperloop One, has been featured in talks to arrive here since 2016,
        when the company first launched its Hyperloop One Global Challenge.

        Multiple hyperloop startups have sprung up worldwide since then, including
        the Toronto-based TransPod, which has developed its own hyperloop prototype
        that would see a network of tubes containing pods travelling at speeds greater
        than 1,000 km/hour.

        Hyperloop technology has been debated widely by transportation experts, some
        who see the tube as more of a novel idea than a practical way of getting around.
        There are no hyperloop systems currently operating anywhere in the world.

        According to the TransPod website, a one-way trip on their hyperloop from
        Toronto to Monreal would cost $80, if booked for a same-day trip.'

          Elon Musk is back in the loop.

          Four years after encouraging anyone and everyone to try making his crazy
          hyperloop idea work, the Silicon Valley titan has decided he s not too busy
          to do it himself after all. You could see this coming last month, of course.
          That s when Musk announced his tunneling outfit, the Boring Company, received  verbal
          government approval  to dig a hyperloop tunnel between New York and Washington,
          DC. When WIRED asked Musk via Twitter who might build the hyperloop that
          would fill that tunnel, he replied,  the Boring Company.

          Speculation ramped up last week when Bloomberg, citing  sources close to
          Musk,  reported on his plans. On Monday, a spokesperson for the Boring Company
          confirmed it to WIRED.

          At the Boring Company, we plan to build low-cost, fast-to-dig tunnels that
          will house new high-speed transportation systems,  the spokesperson wrote
          in a statement.  Most will be standard pressurized tunnels with electric
          skates going 125+ mph. For long-distance routes in straight lines, such
          as NY to DC, it will make sense to use pressurized pods in a depressurized

        Wants To Build A High-Speed Hyperloop In India

        The proposed route between Mumbai and Pune could cut travel time from over
        three hours to 25 minutes.

        Richard Branson s project, Virgin Hyperloop One, seeks to decrease travel
        time using vacuum-based underground tunnels.

        British billionaire Richard Branson has announced plans to build a high-speed
        shuttle in India that could potentially revolutionize travel in the country.

        The proposed hyperloop route between Mumbai and Pune, two major cities in
        the western state of Maharashtra, would reduce travel time from over three
        hours by train to just 25 minutes, according to a Virgin press release.

        Branson, co-founder of the British multinational conglomerate, signed a preliminary
        agreement with Maharashtra''s government on Sunday, the Press Trust of India
        reports. The project will now undergo an extensive feasibility study.

        "I believe Virgin Hyperloop One could have the same impact upon India in the
        21st century as trains did in the 20th century," Branson said in the press
        release. "The Pune-Mumbai route is an ideal first corridor as part of a national
        hyperloop network that will dramatically reduce travel times between most
        of India''s major cities to under two hours."

        A post shared by HyperloopOne (@hyperloopone) on Feb 17, 2018 at 9:26am PST

        The hyperloop will also connect passengers to the proposed Navi Mumbai International
        Airport, which is being built near Mumbai. Branson estimated that the shuttle
        would support 150 million passenger trips per year and "create a thriving,
        competitive megaregion."

        Entrepreneur Elon Musk first published a white paper outlining his vision
        for a vacuum-based, high-speed, underground shuttle system, or hyperloop,'
      - 'Hyperloop Wikipedia_0 | Hyperloop

        A Hyperloop is a proposed mode of passenger and/or freight transportation,
        first used to describe an open-source vactrain design released by a joint
        team from Tesla and SpaceX. Drawing heavily from Robert Goddard''s vactrain,
        a hyperloop comprises a sealed tube or system of tubes through which a pod
        may travel free of air resistance or friction conveying people or objects
        at high speed while being very efficient.

        Elon Musk''s version of the concept, first publicly mentioned in 2012, incorporates
        reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on air bearings
        driven by linear induction motors and air compressors.

        The Hyperloop Alpha concept was first published in August 2013, proposing
        and examining a route running from the Los Angeles region to the San Francisco
        Bay Area roughly following the Interstate 5 corridor. The paper conceived
        of a hyperloop system that would propel passengers along the route at an average
        speed of around , with a top speed of , allowing for a travel time of 35 minutes,
        which is considerably faster than current rail or air travel times. Preliminary
        cost estimates for this LA-SF suggested route were included in the white paper--
        for a passenger-only version, and for a somewhat larger-diameter version transporting
        passengers and vehicles--although transportation analysts had doubts that
        the system could be constructed on that budget; some analysts claimed that
        the Hyperloop would be several billion dollars overbudget, taking into consideration
        construction, development and operation costs.

        The Hyperloop concept has been explicitly "open-sourced" by Musk and SpaceX,

      Hyperloop One says it s getting closer to its first full-scale test run.

      A Hyperloop One tube in North Las Vegas, Nevada.

      If you believe the hype, the Hyperloop is the future of long-distance travel.
      For a while, however, it looked like that future would arrive first outside
      of the United States.

      Since its first public test run in Nevada in May 2016, Los Angeles-based Hyperloop
      One has announced feasibility studies across the globe, in the United Arab Emirates,
      the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K., and Russia. While much
      of the initial discussion when the company was founded in 2014 focused on a
      potential Los Angeles-San Francisco route, the company s blueprint has been
      bereft of any formal plan to deeply explore development in the U.S.

      Now, the startup is turning its attention back to America. On Thursday, the
      company announced that it has created a list of 35 potential routes from across
      the globe vying to be the world s first route. Of those 35 routes, 11 are in
      the U.S. They were chosen from submissions, largely put together by local governments.

      According to a post on the company s website, the plan is to choose three of
      those routes for further study. The teams behind those three routes will work
      closely with Hyperloop One to analyze logistics and financing.

      The candidates include routes linking:

      Miami and Orlando

      Boston and Providence

      Chicago and Pittsburgh

      Reno and Las Vegas

      The only specific technical hints Musk has provided is that it s not a vacuum

      Ever wanted to ride to work in a screaming roller-coaster gun? If your answer
      was yes: good news!

      Elon Musk - of SpaceX and Tesla Motors fame - recently proposed the "Hyperloop,"
      a high-speed floating train that''s accelerated by magnets and coasts between
      destinations. Hailed as the train of the future, the concept is indeed pretty
      fancy. Described by Musk himself as "the fifth mode of transport," it''s intended
      to provide fast and safe transit, largely self-powered with electricity generated
      by its own solar panels.

      Musk recently announced his company would build a test track in California.
      But I don''t think the Hyperloop is going to work well in California - or in
      fact anywhere else on Earth. It could, however, work quite well on a different
      planet. Mars, for instance. But to appreciate why, we need to take a closer
      look at the train in more detail.

      Buckle up for the Hyperloop ride. SpaceX, CC BY

      How would Hyperloop work?

      The Hyperloop train concept is based on the idea of a "vactrain." That''s a
      high-speed train run in a tube that has had all the air removed, making it a
      vacuum - hence the name. Having no air in the tube means (almost) no drag, the
      aerodynamic force that pushes in the opposite direction from which a train'
    - 'Hyperloop

      A Hyperloop is a proposed mode of passenger and/or freight transportation, first
      used to describe an open-source vactrain design released by a joint team from
      Tesla and SpaceX. Drawing heavily from Robert Goddard''s vactrain, a hyperloop
      comprises a sealed tube or system of tubes through which a pod may travel free
      of air resistance or friction conveying people or objects at high speed while
      being very efficient.

      Elon Musk''s version of the concept, first publicly mentioned in 2012, incorporates
      reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on air bearings driven
      by linear induction motors and air compressors.

      The Hyperloop Alpha concept was first published in August 2013, proposing and
      examining a route running from the Los Angeles region to the San Francisco Bay
      Area roughly following the Interstate 5 corridor. The paper conceived of a hyperloop
      system that would propel passengers along the route at an average speed of around
      , with a top speed of , allowing for a travel time of 35 minutes, which is considerably
      faster than current rail or air travel times. Preliminary cost estimates for
      this LA-SF suggested route were included in the white paper-- for a passenger-only
      version, and for a somewhat larger-diameter version transporting passengers
      and vehicles--although transportation analysts had doubts that the system could
      be constructed on that budget; some analysts claimed that the Hyperloop would
      be several billion dollars overbudget, taking into consideration construction,
      development and operation costs.

      The Hyperloop concept has been explicitly "open-sourced" by Musk and SpaceX,
      and others have been encouraged to take the ideas and further'

        focused on a potential Los Angeles-San Francisco route, the company s blueprint
        has been bereft of any formal plan to deeply explore development in the U.S.

        Now, the startup is turning its attention back to America. On Thursday, the
        company announced that it has created a list of 35 potential routes from across
        the globe vying to be the world s first route. Of those 35 routes, 11 are
        in the U.S. They were chosen from submissions, largely put together by local
        governments.

        According to a post on the company s website, the plan is to choose three
        of those routes for further study. The teams behind those three routes will
        work closely with Hyperloop One to analyze logistics and financing.

        The candidates include routes linking:

        Miami and Orlando

        Boston and Providence

        Chicago and Pittsburgh

        Reno and Las Vegas

        a triangle connecting Houston, Dallas, and Austin

        What is Elon Musk s Hyperloop? (Photo: Shutterstock)

        Over the past year, Elon Musk, billionaire founder of PayPal, Tesla, and SpaceX,
        has been floating the notion of a  Hyperloop  as a future replacement for
        bullet trains; one that would get commuters from San Francisco to Los Angeles
        in as little as 30 minutes. There has been much speculation over how the Hyperloop
        works, as Musk has revealed very few details. So what has Musk actually said
        and what might this translate to in the real world?

        What has Musk actually revealed about the Hyperloop? Putting together the
        bits and pieces from his comments over the past year amounts to something
        of a performance brief for what the Hyperloop would be capable of. In addition
        to the killer feature (downtown Los Angeles to downtown San Francisco in 30
        minutes), we know that Hyperloop would double the gate-to-gate average speed
        of an aircraft over that distance, which is 560 km (350 miles). Musk has said
        Hyperloop is a non-scheduled service which leaves when you arrive, is immune
        to the weather and never crashes. The only specific technical hints Musk has
        provided is that it s not a vacuum tunnel, but is a cross between Concorde,
        a railgun and an air hockey table. This makes quite an impressive list of
        attributes. Naturally, there is a lot of speculation as to what Musk s Hyperloop
        must be.

        It s clear that he is proposing a system for subsonic transport. Travelling

        Ever wanted to ride to work in a screaming roller-coaster gun? If your answer
        was yes: good news!

        Elon Musk - of SpaceX and Tesla Motors fame - recently proposed the "Hyperloop,"
        a high-speed floating train that''s accelerated by magnets and coasts between
        destinations. Hailed as the train of the future, the concept is indeed pretty
        fancy. Described by Musk himself as "the fifth mode of transport," it''s intended
        to provide fast and safe transit, largely self-powered with electricity generated
        by its own solar panels.

        Musk recently announced his company would build a test track in California.
        But I don''t think the Hyperloop is going to work well in California - or
        in fact anywhere else on Earth. It could, however, work quite well on a different
        planet. Mars, for instance. But to appreciate why, we need to take a closer
        look at the train in more detail.

        How would Hyperloop work?

        The Hyperloop train concept is based on the idea of a "vactrain." That''s
        a high-speed train run in a tube that has had all the air removed, making
        it a vacuum - hence the name. Having no air in the tube means (almost) no
        drag, the aerodynamic force that pushes in the opposite direction from which
        a train'

        A Hyperloop is a proposed mode of passenger and/or freight transportation,
        first used to describe an open-source vactrain design released by a joint
        team from Tesla and SpaceX. Drawing heavily from Robert Goddard''s vactrain,
        a hyperloop comprises a sealed tube or system of tubes through which a pod
        may travel free of air resistance or friction conveying people or objects
        at high speed while being very efficient.

        Elon Musk''s version of the concept, first publicly mentioned in 2012, incorporates
        reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on air bearings
        driven by linear induction motors and air compressors.

        The Hyperloop Alpha concept was first published in August 2013, proposing
        and examining a route running from the Los Angeles region to the San Francisco
        Bay Area roughly following the Interstate 5 corridor. The paper conceived
        of a hyperloop system that would propel passengers along the route at an average
        speed of around , with a top speed of , allowing for a travel time of 35 minutes,
        which is considerably faster than current rail or air travel times. Preliminary
        cost estimates for this LA-SF suggested route were included in the white paper--
        for a passenger-only version, and for a somewhat larger-diameter version transporting
        passengers and vehicles--although transportation analysts had doubts that
        the system could be constructed on that budget; some analysts claimed that
        the Hyperloop would be several billion dollars overbudget, taking into consideration
        construction, development and operation costs.

        The Hyperloop concept has been explicitly "open-sourced" by Musk and SpaceX,
        and others have been encouraged to take the ideas and further'
