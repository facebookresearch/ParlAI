      Meet Terrell (TJ)

      I am a 1st generation college graduate and 1st generation post graduate from
      Hampton University and University of Maryland respectively. I have a B.S. and
      M.S. in Electrical Engineering. My academic success is due to my mom''s dedication
      to my education from an early age. My mother also suffers from a mental illness,
      in particularly, schizophrenia.As a result, my childhood and my younger siblings
      were split between my mom and my grandparents.

      My grandparents taught me how to cook. I''ve been cooking since I was 14 years
      old for myself and others. One of my grandfather''s specialties and a favorite
      of my mom''s was cheesecakes.

      In finding the company in 2016, we wanted to create a company that contributed
      funding to alternate treatments of people who suffer mental illness instead
      of institutionalization. These are mothers, fathers, kids, sisters, brothers,
      aunts, uncles, cousins, friends...family. The goal is to find more effective
      ways for people to heal at home with family.

      Peanut Butter Honey Truffles

      Published October 19, 2012 - Last Updated August 13, 2018

      I wanted to share a quick, easy treat before the weekend, and these Peanut Butter
      Honey Truffles seemed like the perfect choice. I make a batch of these little
      snacks every so often and keep them in the fridge. I learned to make them back
      in elementary school at a summer day camp. Once a week, between tie die and
      ceramics class, they would teach us a new recipe. We made easy things like granola
      and trail mix. Of all the recipes we learned, I liked these truffles the best.
      They''re made from simple, natural, unprocessed ingredients- peanut butter,
      oats, honey, and coconut. What could be bad?

      Back in camp we made the truffles with whole oats, but over the years I''ve
      discovered that I like them better when I blend the oats to a powder. They''re
      perfect for when I need a little protein pick-me-up. The honey satisfies my
      sweet tooth, and the peanut butter satiates my hunger. They''re very filling;
      a couple of truffles totally tide me over between meals. They''re also gluten
      free if you use GF certified oats. They''re really easy to make and you can
      get the kids involved- they''ll have fun rolling the truffles with you. It''s
      simple, unprocessed snack food you can feel good about. Shabbat shalom!

      August 19th is National Honey Bee Day and I think this is a great reason to
      select and share some of my all-time favorite honey recipes. As you can probably
      guess from the name of this website, I am a big fan of honey. I have talked
      to multiple bee keepers and visited countless hives to learn as much as I can
      about nature''s sweetest bounty and it''s creator.

      I have even let bees crawl all over me - some say I''m crazy for doing this
      but I have learned enough to lose much of my fear of being stung. Don''t swat
      at the bees - they''re just looking for their honey.

      We have yet to become apiary owners ourselves but that doesn''t stop us from
      enjoying all things honey. I have created many honey recipes over the years
      of this blog and I have favorites of course. Below you will find what I believe
      are the best honey recipes!

      Easy Orange Honey Ham

      This ham recipe is going to be your new go-to for the holidays!

      Orange Honey Roast Chicken

      Perfectly light and savory Orange Honey Roast Chicken baked at a high heat and
      basted in an orange zest honey.

      Easy Honey Blue Cheese Crostini

      An easy appetizer recipe - perfect for parties!

      Bacon wrapped dates topped with a honey balsamic reduction - fancy finger food!
      This is the perfect party appetizer.

      Different varieties lend themselves to different uses,  says Test Kitchen Pro
      and Resident Cooking Light Beekepper Adam Hickman. Clover and orange blossom
      are the workhorse honeys. More abundant (and therefore less expensive), they
      have a straightforward flavor that s great for cooking, baking, or sweetening
      iced tea. Harder-to-come-by varietals, like tupelo and sage,  have nuanced flavors
      you don t want to cook out or mask.  These recipes celebrate the pure, sweet
      liquid gold and make brilliant use of honey s delicious, unique character.

      Did you know? Each bee makes about 1/12 of a teaspoon of honey in its life.
      Honey is the sweet nectar of a bee s lifetime work. These healthy honey recipes
      feature several varietals of honey. Consult your local beekeeper for something
      unique and different if you want to break away from classic clover or orange
      blossom honey.

      Because the wings get a good bit of char, the type of honey you use isn t as
      important here (it ll lose its subtler nuances). Though we remove the skin from
      the wings, you d never know it--they pick up an irresistible crispy crunch as
      the glaze cooks under the broiler. Give yourself a better grip when skinning
      each wing by holding it with a paper towel in one hand and pulling the skin
      with another paper towel in the other hand.

        Meet Terrell (TJ)

        I am a 1st generation college graduate and 1st generation post graduate from
        Hampton University and University of Maryland respectively. I have a B.S.
        and M.S. in Electrical Engineering. My academic success is due to my mom''s
        dedication to my education from an early age. My mother also suffers from
        a mental illness, in particularly, schizophrenia.As a result, my childhood
        and my younger siblings were split between my mom and my grandparents.

        My grandparents taught me how to cook. I''ve been cooking since I was 14 years
        old for myself and others. One of my grandfather''s specialties and a favorite
        of my mom''s was cheesecakes.

        In finding the company in 2016, we wanted to create a company that contributed
        funding to alternate treatments of people who suffer mental illness instead
        of institutionalization. These are mothers, fathers, kids, sisters, brothers,
        aunts, uncles, cousins, friends...family. The goal is to find more effective
        ways for people to heal at home with family.

        Peanut Butter Honey Truffles

        Published October 19, 2012 - Last Updated August 13, 2018

        I wanted to share a quick, easy treat before the weekend, and these Peanut
        Butter Honey Truffles seemed like the perfect choice. I make a batch of these
        little snacks every so often and keep them in the fridge. I learned to make
        them back in elementary school at a summer day camp. Once a week, between
        tie die and ceramics class, they would teach us a new recipe. We made easy
        things like granola and trail mix. Of all the recipes we learned, I liked
        these truffles the best. They''re made from simple, natural, unprocessed ingredients-
        peanut butter, oats, honey, and coconut. What could be bad?

        Back in camp we made the truffles with whole oats, but over the years I''ve
        discovered that I like them better when I blend the oats to a powder. They''re
        perfect for when I need a little protein pick-me-up. The honey satisfies my
        sweet tooth, and the peanut butter satiates my hunger. They''re very filling;
        a couple of truffles totally tide me over between meals. They''re also gluten
        free if you use GF certified oats. They''re really easy to make and you can
        get the kids involved- they''ll have fun rolling the truffles with you. It''s
        simple, unprocessed snack food you can feel good about. Shabbat shalom!

        August 19th is National Honey Bee Day and I think this is a great reason to
        select and share some of my all-time favorite honey recipes. As you can probably
        guess from the name of this website, I am a big fan of honey. I have talked
        to multiple bee keepers and visited countless hives to learn as much as I
        can about nature''s sweetest bounty and it''s creator.

        I have even let bees crawl all over me - some say I''m crazy for doing this
        but I have learned enough to lose much of my fear of being stung. Don''t swat
        at the bees - they''re just looking for their honey.

        We have yet to become apiary owners ourselves but that doesn''t stop us from
        enjoying all things honey. I have created many honey recipes over the years
        of this blog and I have favorites of course. Below you will find what I believe
        are the best honey recipes!

        Different varieties lend themselves to different uses,  says Test Kitchen
        Pro and Resident Cooking Light Beekepper Adam Hickman. Clover and orange blossom
        are the workhorse honeys. More abundant (and therefore less expensive), they
        have a straightforward flavor that s great for cooking, baking, or sweetening
        iced tea. Harder-to-come-by varietals, like tupelo and sage,  have nuanced
        flavors you don t want to cook out or mask.  These recipes celebrate the pure,
        sweet liquid gold and make brilliant use of honey s delicious, unique character.

        Did you know? Each bee makes about 1/12 of a teaspoon of honey in its life.
        Honey is the sweet nectar of a bee s lifetime work. These healthy honey recipes
        feature several varietals of honey. Consult your local beekeeper for something
        unique and different if you want to break away from classic clover or orange
        blossom honey.

        Because the wings get a good bit of char, the type of honey you use isn t
        as important here (it ll lose its subtler nuances). Though we remove the skin
        from the wings, you d never know it--they pick up an irresistible crispy crunch
        as the glaze cooks under the broiler. Give yourself a better grip when skinning
        each wing by holding it with a paper towel in one hand and pulling the skin
        with another paper towel in the other hand.

        Meet Terrell (TJ)

        I am a 1st generation college graduate and 1st generation post graduate from
        Hampton University and University of Maryland respectively. I have a B.S.
        and M.S. in Electrical Engineering. My academic success is due to my mom''s
        dedication to my education from an early age. My mother also suffers from
        a mental illness, in particularly, schizophrenia.As a result, my childhood
        and my younger siblings were split between my mom and my grandparents.

        My grandparents taught me how to cook. I''ve been cooking since I was 14 years
        old for myself and others. One of my grandfather''s specialties and a favorite
        of my mom''s was cheesecakes.

        In finding the company in 2016, we wanted to create a company that contributed
        funding to alternate treatments of people who suffer mental illness instead
        of institutionalization. These are mothers, fathers, kids, sisters, brothers,
        aunts, uncles, cousins, friends...family. The goal is to find more effective
        ways for people to heal at home with family.

        How can our services help you and your company???

        Peanut Butter Honey Truffles

        Published October 19, 2012 - Last Updated August 13, 2018

        I wanted to share a quick, easy treat before the weekend, and these Peanut
        Butter Honey Truffles seemed like the perfect choice. I make a batch of these
        little snacks every so often and keep them in the fridge. I learned to make
        them back in elementary school at a summer day camp. Once a week, between
        tie die and ceramics class, they would teach us a new recipe. We made easy
        things like granola and trail mix. Of all the recipes we learned, I liked
        these truffles the best. They''re made from simple, natural, unprocessed ingredients-
        peanut butter, oats, honey, and coconut. What could be bad?

        Back in camp we made the truffles with whole oats, but over the years I''ve
        discovered that I like them better when I blend the oats to a powder. They''re
        perfect for when I need a little protein pick-me-up. The honey satisfies my
        sweet tooth, and the peanut butter satiates my hunger. They''re very filling;
        a couple of truffles totally tide me over between meals. They''re also gluten
        free if you use GF certified oats. They''re really easy to make and you can
        get the kids involved- they''ll have fun rolling the truffles with you. It''s
        simple, unprocessed snack food you can feel good about. Shabbat shalom!

        August 19th is National Honey Bee Day and I think this is a great reason to
        select and share some of my all-time favorite honey recipes. As you can probably
        guess from the name of this website, I am a big fan of honey. I have talked
        to multiple bee keepers and visited countless hives to learn as much as I
        can about nature''s sweetest bounty and it''s creator.

        I have even let bees crawl all over me - some say I''m crazy for doing this
        but I have learned enough to lose much of my fear of being stung. Don''t swat
        at the bees - they''re just looking for their honey.

        We have yet to become apiary owners ourselves but that doesn''t stop us from
        enjoying all things honey. I have created many honey recipes over the years
        of this blog and I have favorites of course. Below you will find what I believe
        are the best honey recipes!

        Different varieties lend themselves to different uses,  says Test Kitchen
        Pro and Resident Cooking Light Beekepper Adam Hickman. Clover and orange blossom
        are the workhorse honeys. More abundant (and therefore less expensive), they
        have a straightforward flavor that s great for cooking, baking, or sweetening
        iced tea. Harder-to-come-by varietals, like tupelo and sage,  have nuanced
        flavors you don t want to cook out or mask.  These recipes celebrate the pure,
        sweet liquid gold and make brilliant use of honey s delicious, unique character.

        Did you know? Each bee makes about 1/12 of a teaspoon of honey in its life.
        Honey is the sweet nectar of a bee s lifetime work. These healthy honey recipes
        feature several varietals of honey. Consult your local beekeeper for something
        unique and different if you want to break away from classic clover or orange
        blossom honey.

        Because the wings get a good bit of char, the type of honey you use isn t
        as important here (it ll lose its subtler nuances). Though we remove the skin
        from the wings, you d never know it--they pick up an irresistible crispy crunch
        as the glaze cooks under the broiler. Give yourself a better grip when skinning
        each wing by holding it with a paper towel in one hand and pulling the skin
        with another paper towel in the other hand.

      No-Bake Old-Fashioned Peanut Butter Balls

      This 3-Ingredient, No-Bake Old Fashioned Peanut Butter Ball Recipe is simple
      to make and will take you back to your childhood with the first bite!

      I grew up in West Virginia in a school that offered home cooked, fresh meals
      daily. We would have homemade biscuits and gravy, oatmeal and pancakes for breakfast
      and spaghetti, yeast dinner rolls and scrumptious desserts.

      Those were the days before food was overly processed or schools were being told
      to provide meals that are supposed to be "healthy" but the kids never eat.

      Our "cooks" were grandmas who loved to make meals and would come in before the
      sun came up to start preparing for the day.

      Old-Fashioned Peanut Butter Balls

      One of the things I loved on my tray was Peanut Butter Balls. Remember those
      sweet and peanut buttery balls that came along side your meal as a treat? I
      loved them!

      Nothing fancy but they sure bring back some memories. With only 3 ingredients,
      they''re simple and a healthy treat for my kids in their lunch boxes or as an
      afternoon snack!

      How To Make Old-Fashioned Peanut Butter Balls

      These Old- Fashioned Peanut Butter Balls are a breeze to make! Take peanut butter,
      honey and dry milk and mix together. Form into balls, roll in toppings and chill.
      That''s it!

      Make up a batch rolled in different toppings - corn flakes, powdered sugar,
      coconut, pecans - whatever your heart desires! Here''s a little secret between
      you and me'

    - 'No Bake Peanut Butter & Honey Protein Balls

      Listen, I''ve got a shocker for you. This recipe isn''t paleo. Peanuts aren''t
      actually "nuts" but rather legumes. That''s why peanut allergies are separate
      from tree-nut allergies. Some people have both types of allergies. Some have
      one or the other. Some have none. No one is telling you that you should or should
      not eat it. That''s your choice. But for me, when I was traveling in Seattle
      and found a local company selling incredibly high quality peanut products I
      stocked up with excitement. Of course, TSA took my peanut butter. But that''s
      a sad story for another day. Fortunately CB Nuts is on Amazon and I was able
      to share it with the family after all.

      No need to get your panties twisted. This recipe is nourishing and nutrient-dense.
      It''s high-protein. It''s full of healthy fats. It''s low sugar, and what is
      used is a natural source in low quantities of sweeteners full of vitamins and
      minerals. It''s a great snack for kid & adults alike. It''s also a recreation
      (by request) of Peanut Butter and Honey Balls, which is apparently some childhood
      snack I grew up knowing nothing about (thanks, Mom).

      Years ago our family gave up peanuts because they were on a list of potential
      gut irritants for people who follow a paleo diet. We tried using almond butter,
      a bajillion brands, but none of us ever really liked it. We switched to Sunbutter.
      We were hard core sunflower-seed junkies - since it had the closest taste recreation'

          to make and will take you back to your childhood with the first bite!

          I grew up in West Virginia in a school that offered home cooked, fresh meals
          daily. We would have homemade biscuits and gravy, oatmeal and pancakes for
          breakfast and spaghetti, yeast dinner rolls and scrumptious desserts.

          Those were the days before food was overly processed or schools were being
          told to provide meals that are supposed to be "healthy" but the kids never
          eat.

          Our "cooks" were grandmas who loved to make meals and would come in before
          the sun came up to start preparing for the day.

        Peanut Butter Honey Truffles

        Published October 19, 2012 - Last Updated August 13, 2018

        I wanted to share a quick, easy treat before the weekend, and these Peanut
        Butter Honey Truffles seemed like the perfect choice. I make a batch of these
        little snacks every so often and keep them in the fridge. I learned to make
        them back in elementary school at a summer day camp. Once a week, between
        tie die and ceramics class, they would teach us a new recipe. We made easy
        things like granola and trail mix. Of all the recipes we learned, I liked
        these truffles the best. They''re made from simple, natural, unprocessed ingredients-
        peanut butter, oats, honey, and coconut. What could be bad?

        Back in camp we made the truffles with whole oats, but over the years I''ve
        discovered that I like them better when I blend the oats to a powder. They''re
        perfect for when I need a little protein pick-me-up. The honey satisfies my
        sweet tooth, and the peanut butter satiates my hunger. They''re very filling;
        a couple of truffles totally tide me over between meals. They''re also gluten
        free if you use GF certified oats. They''re really easy to make and you can
        get the kids involved- they''ll have fun rolling the truffles with you. It''s
        simple, unprocessed snack food you can feel good about. Shabbat shalom!

        Peanut Butter Honey Truffles with Coconut - a simple, unprocessed, healthy
        snack for a burst'
      - 'Peanut Butter Truffles Recipe Food Network Kitchen_0 | Yield: about 40 truffles

        2 1/2 cups softened confectioners  sugar

        Possible truffle accompaniments:

        Crushed chocolate wafer cookies

        A variety of crushed nuts, such as peanuts or pistachios

        Miniature chocolate chips

        Crushed candy-coated peanut butter candies

        Beat the confectioners  sugar, peanut butter, melted butter, vanilla extract
        and salt with an electric mixer until well combined. Roll rounded teaspoons
        of the mixture into round balls and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.

        Roll the peanut butter balls in any or all of the possible truffle accompaniments.
        Chill until firm, about 20 minutes. These truffles are best served very chilled.

        Butter & Honey Protein Balls

        Listen, I''ve got a shocker for you. This recipe isn''t paleo. Peanuts aren''t
        actually "nuts" but rather legumes. That''s why peanut allergies are separate
        from tree-nut allergies. Some people have both types of allergies. Some have
        one or the other. Some have none. No one is telling you that you should or
        should not eat it. That''s your choice. But for me, when I was traveling in
        Seattle and found a local company selling incredibly high quality peanut products
        I stocked up with excitement. Of course, TSA took my peanut butter. But that''s
        a sad story for another day. Fortunately CB Nuts is on Amazon and I was able
        to share it with the family after all.

        No need to get your panties twisted. This recipe is nourishing and nutrient-dense.
        It''s high-protein. It''s full of healthy fats. It''s low sugar, and what
        is used is a natural source in low quantities of sweeteners full of vitamins
        and minerals. It''s a great snack for kid & adults alike. It''s also a recreation
        (by request) of Peanut Butter and Honey Balls, which is apparently some childhood
        snack I grew up knowing nothing about (thanks, Mom).

        Years ago our family gave up peanuts because they were on a list of potential
        gut irritants for people who follow a paleo diet. We tried using almond butter,
        a bajillion brands, but none of us ever really liked it. We switched to Sunbutter.
        We were hard core sunflower-seed junkies - since it had the closest taste

      Different varieties lend themselves to different uses,  says Test Kitchen Pro
      and Resident Cooking Light Beekepper Adam Hickman. Clover and orange blossom
      are the workhorse honeys. More abundant (and therefore less expensive), they
      have a straightforward flavor that s great for cooking, baking, or sweetening
      iced tea. Harder-to-come-by varietals, like tupelo and sage,  have nuanced flavors
      you don t want to cook out or mask.  These recipes celebrate the pure, sweet
      liquid gold and make brilliant use of honey s delicious, unique character.

      Did you know? Each bee makes about 1/12 of a teaspoon of honey in its life.
      Honey is the sweet nectar of a bee s lifetime work. These healthy honey recipes
      feature several varietals of honey. Consult your local beekeeper for something
      unique and different if you want to break away from classic clover or orange
      blossom honey.

      Because the wings get a good bit of char, the type of honey you use isn t as
      important here (it ll lose its subtler nuances). Though we remove the skin from
      the wings, you d never know it--they pick up an irresistible crispy crunch as
      the glaze cooks under the broiler. Give yourself a better grip when skinning
      each wing by holding it with a paper towel in one hand and pulling the skin
      with another paper towel in the other hand.

      I am a 1st generation college graduate and 1st generation post graduate from
      Hampton University and University of Maryland respectively. I have a B.S. and
      M.S. in Electrical Engineering. My academic success is due to my mom''s dedication
      to my education from an early age. My mother also suffers from a mental illness,
      in particularly, schizophrenia.As a result, my childhood and my younger siblings
      were split between my mom and my grandparents.

      My grandparents taught me how to cook. I''ve been cooking since I was 14 years
      old for myself and others. One of my grandfather''s specialties and a favorite
      of my mom''s was cheesecakes.

      In finding the company in 2016, we wanted to create a company that contributed
      funding to alternate treatments of people who suffer mental illness instead
      of institutionalization. These are mothers, fathers, kids, sisters, brothers,
      aunts, uncles, cousins, friends...family. The goal is to find more effective
      ways for people to heal at home with family.

      August 19th is National Honey Bee Day and I think this is a great reason to
      select and share some of my all-time favorite honey recipes. As you can probably
      guess from the name of this website, I am a big fan of honey. I have talked
      to multiple bee keepers and visited countless hives to learn as much as I can
      about nature''s sweetest bounty and it''s creator.

      I have even let bees crawl all over me - some say I''m crazy for doing this
      but I have learned enough to lose much of my fear of being stung. Don''t swat
      at the bees - they''re just looking for their honey.

      We have yet to become apiary owners ourselves but that doesn''t stop us from
      enjoying all things honey. I have created many honey recipes over the years

        Meet Terrell (TJ)

        I am a 1st generation college graduate and 1st generation post graduate from
        Hampton University and University of Maryland respectively. I have a B.S.
        and M.S. in Electrical Engineering. My academic success is due to my mom''s
        dedication to my education from an early age. My mother also suffers from
        a mental illness, in particularly, schizophrenia.As a result, my childhood
        and my younger siblings were split between my mom and my grandparents.

        My grandparents taught me how to cook. I''ve been cooking since I was 14 years
        old for myself and others. One of my grandfather''s specialties and a favorite
        of my mom''s was cheesecakes.

        In finding the company in 2016, we wanted to create a company that contributed
        funding to alternate treatments of people who suffer mental illness instead
        of institutionalization. These are mothers, fathers, kids, sisters, brothers,
        aunts, uncles, cousins, friends...family. The goal is to find more effective
        ways for people to heal at home with family.

        August 19th is National Honey Bee Day and I think this is a great reason to
        select and share some of my all-time favorite honey recipes. As you can probably
        guess from the name of this website, I am a big fan of honey. I have talked
        to multiple bee keepers and visited countless hives to learn as much as I
        can about nature''s sweetest bounty and it''s creator.

        I have even let bees crawl all over me - some say I''m crazy for doing this
        but I have learned enough to lose much of my fear of being stung. Don''t swat
        at the bees - they''re just looking for their honey.

        We have yet to become apiary owners ourselves but that doesn''t stop us from
        enjoying all things honey. I have created many honey recipes over the years
        of this blog and I have favorites of course. Below you will find what I believe
        are the best honey recipes!

        are the workhorse honeys. More abundant (and therefore less expensive), they
        have a straightforward flavor that s great for cooking, baking, or sweetening
        iced tea. Harder-to-come-by varietals, like tupelo and sage,  have nuanced
        flavors you don t want to cook out or mask.  These recipes celebrate the pure,
        sweet liquid gold and make brilliant use of honey s delicious, unique character.

        I am a 1st generation college graduate and 1st generation post graduate from
        Hampton University and University of Maryland respectively. I have a B.S.
        and M.S. in Electrical Engineering. My academic success is due to my mom''s
        dedication to my education from an early age. My mother also suffers from
        a mental illness, in particularly, schizophrenia.As a result, my childhood
        and my younger siblings were split between my mom and my grandparents.

        My grandparents taught me how to cook. I''ve been cooking since I was 14 years
        old for myself and others. One of my grandfather''s specialties and a favorite
        of my mom''s was cheesecakes.

        In finding the company in 2016, we wanted to create a company that contributed
        funding to alternate treatments of people who suffer mental illness instead
        of institutionalization. These are mothers, fathers, kids, sisters, brothers,
        aunts, uncles, cousins, friends...family. The goal is to find more effective

        August 19th is National Honey Bee Day and I think this is a great reason to
        select and share some of my all-time favorite honey recipes. As you can probably
        guess from the name of this website, I am a big fan of honey. I have talked
        to multiple bee keepers and visited countless hives to learn as much as I
        can about nature''s sweetest bounty and it''s creator.

        I have even let bees crawl all over me - some say I''m crazy for doing this
        but I have learned enough to lose much of my fear of being stung. Don''t swat
        at the bees - they''re just looking for their honey.

    - 'Sweet as Honey: Delicious Indian Desserts

      by Malar Gandhi | Oct 8, 2018 | Food, Recipes | 1 comment

      Honey was man''s first sweetener. Honey was also an important condiment in medieval
      times. We crave sweets, as our stone-age forefathers have been deprived of it
      for centuries. Humans (Homo sapiens) evolved some 50,000 years ago, whereas
      bees were making honey 40 million years before that. Honeybees as a group probably
      originated in South East Asia. It seems they developed social behavior and structural
      identity similar to what we observe in modern honey bees, some 30 million years
      ago. Apis mellifera, known as the western honey bee, is a commonly domesticated
      species. It is believed to have originated in Africa and spread later to Europe
      and Asia. Honey was the staple sweetener in Europe till the 1500s. The name
      "honey" comes from the English word "huning." In 1622, European colonists brought
      these sub-species to Americas. Cooking with honey was a mark of privilege and
      it was long used for preserving fruits whole or as a jam.

      Cave paintings in Spain from 7000 B.C show the earliest records of bee keeping.
      Honey is also mentioned in Sumerian and Babylonian cuneiform writings from 2100
      B.C. From available evidence, we know that humans have been collecting honey
      for 10,000 years. But the interplay between bees and flowers is understood much
      later in 1000 A.D.

      The pre-historic cave paintings at Bhimbetka in India show men despoiling beehives
      built on rocks, perhaps around 6000 B.C. Even as early as the Rigvedic period
      (2nd and 1st century)'

      Honey Posset: The Easiest Entertaining Dessert You''ve Never Heard Of

      This honey posset recipe is my go to entertaining dessert because they require
      no special ingredients, can be made ahead and they look so fancy! We won''t
      tell anyone how insanely simple they are.

      Up until about a year ago, I had never heard of a posset before. A sweet friend
      shared her recipe with me as her most made dessert and I was immediately so
      intrigued...just 4 ingredients and no tempering eggs or messing with gelatin?!

      My interest had been thoroughly peaked and I made it that week for a dinner
      party. I now consider this one of my greatest entertaining skill sets too!

      Today I''m sharing with you my favorite version of this dish....lavender honey
      posset. My guests are always a little thrown off by lavender showing up in their
      dessert but as soon as they taste it, all things are right again in the world.

      The flavors here are delicate, creamy, intricate, refreshingly different to
      the palate. The dish is thick and custardy but not in the way an egg custard
      is and nothing like a gelatin based dessert. Its simplicity is a thing of beauty.

      After my mind was blown by this new concept I got curious...why had no one ever
      heard of this? And I had to geek out on the history. Let''s jump in...

      Possets while relatively unheard of in modern history has a long and rich story
      spanning back generations. Shakespeare spoke'
    - 'we react to words in different ways. for instance, "interesting" to some people
      could mean what it was originally meant to be. "interesting" to my mom implies
      unusual, and not in a complementary way.

      in some of my friendships, i filter myself and how i phrase my words more. i
      can be a blunt, possibly even verbally aggressive, person, and there are some
      people who can''t handle that. that''s fine. we''ll just talk about classes
      and whatnot. and then there are the people who can handle my heat, and i''ll
      rant to them about whatever or tell them about insignificant little things in
      my day. probably in caps, perhaps with some autocorrect mistakes ("delirious"
      turned into "delicious" the other day. that was not my point, especially since
      my sentence in relation to finals studying, "we''re all delirious," became,
      "we''re all delicious." ack), sometimes with a vastly different language. that''s
      why i''m not fazed by some things that, for lack of a better phrase, would cause
      others to be like, "AW HELL NO." (somehow my family picked up on this phrase
      and i''m not sure how/why this came to be).

      like anything, we''re shaped by the experiences we''ve had, the people we surround
      ourselves with, the beliefs we live by. so to me, the kind of person who has
      had plenty of sweets in her life but doesn''t like particularly sugar-y things,
      "honeyed" has a cloying, candy corn (this is a disgrace to all candy everywhere,
      make no mistake) ring to it that i don''t like. good thing this'

      Greek Orange Honey Cake with Pistachios

      I''ve been having fun with olive oil cakes, including Italian Apple Olive Oil
      Cake and this Orange Ricotta Cake. But my very favorite currently is this Greek
      orange honey cake!

      This light, flavor-packed honey cake skips all the fuss. And it''s the simple
      cake that will feed a crowd.

      In search for easy desserts that aren''t laden with butter or frosting, I happened
      upon a slightly different version of today''s honey cake in Jamie Oliver''s
      Food Escapes cookbook. An inspiration from the island of Aegina, where pistachios
      and honey from local beekeepers are aplenty! I was immediately hooked!

      This Yiayia-approved honey cake can easily feed a crowd (12 to 15 or so). And
      it''s the kind of simple dessert where you dump all the ingredients in one single
      bowl and mix! But, there is more...

      Why this Honey Cake Works

      There is a lot to love about this honey cake. Top of the list, it''s insanely
      DELICIOUS and very easy to make! But here are a few more things bakers and non-bakers
      alike will appreciate:

      1. The combination of flours, all-purpose flour with coarse semolina (farina),
      gives it such interesting texture.

      2. Greek yogurt here lends a great light and fluffy texture. Plus, its slightly

          Honey was man''s first sweetener. Honey was also an important condiment
          in medieval times. We crave sweets, as our stone-age forefathers have been
          deprived of it for centuries. Humans (Homo sapiens) evolved some 50,000
          years ago, whereas bees were making honey 40 million years before that.
          Honeybees as a group probably originated in South East Asia. It seems they
          developed social behavior and structural identity similar to what we observe
          in modern honey bees, some 30 million years ago. Apis mellifera, known as
          the western honey bee, is a commonly domesticated species. It is believed
          to have originated in Africa and spread later to Europe and Asia. Honey
          was the staple sweetener in Europe till the 1500s. The name "honey" comes
          from the English word "huning." In 1622, European colonists brought these
          sub-species to Americas. Cooking with honey was a mark of privilege and
          it was long used for preserving fruits whole or as a jam.

          Cave paintings in Spain from 7000 B.C show the earliest records of bee keeping.
          Honey is also mentioned in Sumerian and Babylonian cuneiform writings from
          2100 B.C. From available evidence, we know that humans have been collecting
          honey for 10,000 years. But the interplay between bees and flowers is understood
          much later in 1000 A.D.

          The pre-historic cave paintings at Bhimbetka in India show men despoiling
          beehives built on rocks, perhaps around 6000 B.C. Even as early as the Rigvedic
          period (2nd and 1st century)'

          Up until about a year ago, I had never heard of a posset before. A sweet
          friend shared her recipe with me as her most made dessert and I was immediately
          so intrigued...just 4 ingredients and no tempering eggs or messing with
          gelatin?!

          My interest had been thoroughly peaked and I made it that week for a dinner

          up in their dessert but as soon as they taste it, all things are right again
          in the world.

          The flavors here are delicate, creamy, intricate, refreshingly different
          to the palate. The dish is thick and custardy but not in the way an egg
          custard is and nothing like a gelatin based dessert. Its simplicity is a
          thing of beauty.

          After my mind was blown by this new concept I got curious...why had no one

        ways. for instance, "interesting" to some people could mean what it was originally

        in some of my friendships, i filter myself and how i phrase my words more.
        i can be a blunt, possibly even verbally aggressive, person, and there are

        Greek Orange Honey Cake with Pistachios

        I''ve been having fun with olive oil cakes, including Italian Apple Olive
        Oil Cake and this Orange Ricotta Cake. But my very favorite currently is this
        Greek orange honey cake!

        This light, flavor-packed honey cake skips all the fuss. And it''s the simple
        cake that will feed a crowd.

        In search for easy desserts that aren''t laden with butter or frosting, I
        happened upon a slightly different version of today''s honey cake in Jamie
        Oliver''s Food Escapes cookbook. An inspiration from the island of Aegina,
        where pistachios and honey from local beekeepers are aplenty! I was immediately
        hooked!

        This Yiayia-approved honey cake can easily feed a crowd (12 to 15 or so).
        And it''s the kind of simple dessert where you dump all the ingredients in
        one single bowl and mix! But, there is more...

        Why this Honey Cake Works

        There is a lot to love about this honey cake. Top of the list, it''s insanely
        DELICIOUS and very easy to make! But here are a few more things bakers and
        non-bakers alike will appreciate:

        1. The combination of flours, all-purpose flour with coarse semolina (farina),
        gives it such interesting texture.

        2. Greek yogurt here lends a great light and fluffy texture. Plus, its slightly
        tangy flavor balances so well with crave-worthy citrus from the generous amounts
        of orange and lemon zest.

        3. The honey-pistachio SYRUP is king in this recipe! Admittedly, Jamie''s
        original recipe called for less syrup; I found that more of it was need for
        such a large cake.'

          Honey was man''s first sweetener. Honey was also an important condiment
          in medieval times. We crave sweets, as our stone-age forefathers have been
          deprived of it for centuries. Humans (Homo sapiens) evolved some 50,000
          years ago, whereas bees were making honey 40 million years before that.
          Honeybees as a group probably originated in South East Asia. It seems they
          developed social behavior and structural identity similar to what we observe
          in modern honey bees, some 30 million years ago. Apis mellifera, known as
          the western honey bee, is a commonly domesticated species. It is believed
          to have originated in Africa and spread later to Europe and Asia. Honey
          was the staple sweetener in Europe till the 1500s. The name "honey" comes
          from the English word "huning." In 1622, European colonists brought these
          sub-species to Americas. Cooking with honey was a mark of privilege and
          it was long used for preserving fruits whole or as a jam.

          Cave paintings in Spain from 7000 B.C show the earliest records of bee keeping.
          Honey is also mentioned in Sumerian and Babylonian cuneiform writings from
          2100 B.C. From available evidence, we know that humans have been collecting
          honey for 10,000 years. But the interplay between bees and flowers is understood
          much later in 1000 A.D.

          The pre-historic cave paintings at Bhimbetka in India show men despoiling
          beehives built on rocks, perhaps around 6000 B.C. Even as early as the Rigvedic
          period (2nd and 1st century)'

          Honey Posset: The Easiest Entertaining Dessert You''ve Never Heard Of

          This honey posset recipe is my go to entertaining dessert because they require
          no special ingredients, can be made ahead and they look so fancy! We won''t
          tell anyone how insanely simple they are.

          Up until about a year ago, I had never heard of a posset before. A sweet
          friend shared her recipe with me as her most made dessert and I was immediately
          so intrigued...just 4 ingredients and no tempering eggs or messing with
          gelatin?!

          My interest had been thoroughly peaked and I made it that week for a dinner
          party. I now consider this one of my greatest entertaining skill sets too!

          up in their dessert but as soon as they taste it, all things are right again
          in the world.

          The flavors here are delicate, creamy, intricate, refreshingly different
          to the palate. The dish is thick and custardy but not in the way an egg
          custard is and nothing like a gelatin based dessert. Its simplicity is a
          thing of beauty.

          After my mind was blown by this new concept I got curious...why had no one

        Greek Orange Honey Cake with Pistachios

        I''ve been having fun with olive oil cakes, including Italian Apple Olive
        Oil Cake and this Orange Ricotta Cake. But my very favorite currently is this
        Greek orange honey cake!

        This light, flavor-packed honey cake skips all the fuss. And it''s the simple
        cake that will feed a crowd.

        In search for easy desserts that aren''t laden with butter or frosting, I
        happened upon a slightly different version of today''s honey cake in Jamie
        Oliver''s Food Escapes cookbook. An inspiration from the island of Aegina,
        where pistachios and honey from local beekeepers are aplenty! I was immediately
        hooked!

        This Yiayia-approved honey cake can easily feed a crowd (12 to 15 or so).
        And it''s the kind of simple dessert where you dump all the ingredients in
        one single bowl and mix! But, there is more...

        Why this Honey Cake Works

        There is a lot to love about this honey cake. Top of the list, it''s insanely
        DELICIOUS and very easy to make! But here are a few more things bakers and
        non-bakers alike will appreciate:

        1. The combination of flours, all-purpose flour with coarse semolina (farina),
        gives it such interesting texture.

        2. Greek yogurt here lends a great light and fluffy texture. Plus, its slightly
        tangy flavor balances so well with crave-worthy citrus from the generous amounts
        of orange and lemon zest.

        3. The honey-pistachio SYRUP is king in this recipe! Admittedly, Jamie''s
        original recipe called for less syrup; I found that more of it was need for
        such a large cake.'

      "Be cheerful knight: thou shalt eat a posset to-night at my house" William Shakespeare,
      Hamlet

      Dating back to the middle ages, the posset is making a comeback. Like a custard
      crossed with a pudding, it''s perfect when you want to whip up a special dessert
      with minimal effort. It''s made with three ingredients, honey, lilac-infused
      cream and lemon juice - that''s it. These are gently boiled together and chilled
      overnight. There are no egg yolks, gelatin, flour, or cornstarch. It relies
      on the lemon juice to thicken and set - and the result is simply divine.

      You''ll need to begin by removing all the blossoms from their tiny stems. I
      find that if you include any of the greenery, it interferes with the floral
      flavour - making it a bit vegetal tasting. And we want just the pure sweet fragrance
      of lilac in a posset!

      And if lilac isn''t wonderful enough, try infusing your posset with spring flowers
      like wild rose or elderflower. Jennifer created Elderflower Posset (she tossed
      in a few of our native red elderflowers as well) and we''re both enamoured with
      rose posset as well! But whatever floral you use, remember you need to keep
      the lemon, it acidifies the cream, causing the casein proteins in the cream
      to set.

      Today''s posset is very different from the one often referred to by Shakespeare,
      a drink made from curdled milk, sugar, alcohol and sack,'

      been so intimidating to me though. The idea of using a torch in the kitchen
      freaks me out just a little bit, and using the broiler just doesn''t feel right.
      In my infinite search to satiate my sweet tooth, I came across this amazing
      recipe that brings me all the joy of creme brulee without the kitchen fire.

      It''s just 4 ingredients, but the pay off is to die for. This recipe makes about

          Honey Posset: The Easiest Entertaining Dessert You''ve Never Heard Of

          This honey posset recipe is my go to entertaining dessert because they require
          no special ingredients, can be made ahead and they look so fancy! We won''t
          tell anyone how insanely simple they are.

          Up until about a year ago, I had never heard of a posset before. A sweet
          friend shared her recipe with me as her most made dessert and I was immediately
          so intrigued...just 4 ingredients and no tempering eggs or messing with
          gelatin?!

          My interest had been thoroughly peaked and I made it that week for a dinner
          party. I now consider this one of my greatest entertaining skill sets too!

          Today I''m sharing with you my favorite version of this dish....lavender
          honey posset. My guests are always a little thrown off by lavender showing
          up in their dessert but as soon as they taste it, all things are right again
          in the world.

          The flavors here are delicate, creamy, intricate, refreshingly different
          to the palate. The dish is thick and custardy but not in the way an egg
          custard is and nothing like a gelatin based dessert. Its simplicity is a
          thing of beauty.

          After my mind was blown by this new concept I got curious...why had no one
          ever heard of this? And I had to geek out on the history. Let''s jump in...

          "Be cheerful knight: thou shalt eat a posset to-night at my house" William
          Shakespeare, Hamlet

          Dating back to the middle ages, the posset is making a comeback. Like a
          custard crossed with a pudding, it''s perfect when you want to whip up a
          special dessert with minimal effort. It''s made with three ingredients,
          honey, lilac-infused cream and lemon juice - that''s it. These are gently
          boiled together and chilled overnight. There are no egg yolks, gelatin,
          flour, or cornstarch. It relies on the lemon juice to thicken and set -
          and the result is simply divine.

          You''ll need to begin by removing all the blossoms from their tiny stems.
          I find that if you include any of the greenery, it interferes with the floral
          flavour - making it a bit vegetal tasting. And we want just the pure sweet
          fragrance of lilac in a posset!

          And if lilac isn''t wonderful enough, try infusing your posset with spring
          flowers like wild rose or elderflower. Jennifer created Elderflower Posset
          (she tossed in a few of our native red elderflowers as well) and we''re
          both enamoured with rose posset as well! But whatever floral you use, remember
          you need to keep the lemon, it acidifies the cream, causing the casein proteins
          in the cream to set.

          Today''s posset is very different from the one often referred to by Shakespeare,
