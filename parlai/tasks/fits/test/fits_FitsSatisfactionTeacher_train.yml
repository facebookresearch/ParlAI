        procedure, but if you''ve never changed your own pedals before there are some
        easy mistakes that could leave you with a stuck pedal and a ruined crank arm.
        So here is a quick run through the process and some helpful things you should
        know before changing bike pedals.

        Use a pedal wrench or hex key to unscrew the pedals from the crank arms. Right
        pedals loosen by turning counter-clockwise,'

      If you ve read a cookbook or recipes online recently, chances are high that
      you ve come across a recipe that includes caramelized onions. It seems they
      re everywhere--on sandwiches, in sauces or piled on steaks. Unfortunately, if
      you ve read those recipes, chances are better than even that you ve found contradictory
      and confusing information on how to caramelize them.

      After mushrooms, there s probably more confusion about cooking onions than any
      other vegetable. You ll see caramelized onion recipes that call for sugar, salt
      or baking soda (or none of the above); heat levels that vary from low to high;
      and methods that claim to take anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour. You ll often
      read that you should choose sweet onions to maximize the sugar available for
      caramelizing. What s the real story?

      Types of Onions

      First, a short side trip into onion cultivation. (It will help clarify what
      comes later.) You might think that the important difference between onions is
      the color--yellow, white or red. Not true. Although there are minor differences
      in the way these onions taste, the big difference in onions of any color is
      between spring onions and storage onions.

      Spring onions, as you might imagine, are harvested in the spring, before they
      are fully mature. They''re relatively mild because they contain fewer of the
      sulfur compounds (compared with storage onions) that give onions their sting.

    - 'Caramelized Onions Common Mistakes--and How to Avoid Them

      It s surprisingly tricky to make caramelized onions. Here s what most people
      get wrong when cooking them.

      Caramelized onions are good on pretty much...everything. The only problem? They
      re surprisingly tricky to make. They take time to slowly brown and caramelize.
      It s easy to burn them--and it s easy to remove them from the stove before they
      re actually done. So we talked to senior associate food editor Claire Saffitz
      in the test kitchen to figure out the common mistakes people make when they
      try to make this deeply flavored accoutrement.

      1. Slicing Them Too Thinly

      Thinly sliced onions will burn faster and stick to the bottom of your pan. Aim
      to slice your onions 1/8  thick--their heft will prevent them from drying out.

      2. Using Just Butter

      You definitely want the flavor of butter in your onions--but butter has the
      tendency to burn. For insurance, use a combination of butter and oil, which
      has a higher smoking point. But how much do you use? Depending on the consistency
      you want your onions, you can use more or less fat. Just cover the bottom of
      your pan for jammy, soft caramelized onions, or add a little more for more structured,
      slightly charred caramelized onions. The more fat in the pan, the more the onions
      will fry rather than soften. (Okay, you can fry them a little.) You can use
      just oil, or a combination of butter and oil--the choice is yours!

    - 'Learning how to properly caramelize onions is key. Once you ve mastered the
      basic technique, you''ll use them for everything from French onion soup to onion
      dip to topping burgers. Here, we break down the process step by step.

      2 large yellow onions, peeled (about 1 pound)

      Low-sodium chicken broth or water (for pan; optional)

      Large SaucepanBuy

      Halve both onions through root end. Using the tip of your knife, cut a V-shaped
      notch around root to remove it (this will ensure that all slices separate when
      you cut the onion).

      Place 1 onion half on your cutting board so root end is facing you, then thinly
      slice onion lengthwise, starting at one side and working all the way to the
      other (so your knife runs through the root halfway through, not starting or
      ending at the root end). You''re going for slices that are  1/4  - 1/8   thick.

      Repeat same slicing procedure for remaining onion halves. It''s a lot of onion!
      But it will cook down quite a bit, so it''s best to start with a large quantity.

      Heat 2 Tbsp. butter in a large saucepan over medium until melted and sizzling.
      You can use a skillet to cook the onions, but a pan with high sides will keep
      the onions from flipping out onto your stove. Using a pan that also has a wide
      base gives water room to evaporate, allowing the onions to caramelize rather
      than steam.

      Instead of dumping in all of the onions at once, which would fill the pot and
      make it hard to stir (which would then cause'
    - 'Faster Caramelized Onions with Baking Soda

      Yes, you can caramelize onions quicker!

      Nothing beats the sweet flavor of caramelized onions, but the reward is not
      without a little effort. Truly caramelized onions that are dark brown and soft
      with a flavor as sweet as candy take around 45 minutes to make -- sometimes
      longer. They also need to be watched closely.

      Since not everyone has that kind of time, when we heard about a short-cut, we
      decided we had to try it. Apparently, the trick to getting onions to caramelize
      more quickly is to add baking soda.

      The idea left us both curious and a little skeptical. Caramelized onions are
      a specialty around here, and we are always willing to put in the extra time
      for all that deliciousness. But who are we to deny others from saving time in
      the kitchen?

      Are you curious about this time-saving trick, too? Read on to find out how it
      went in our test kitchen.

      Why baking soda?

      First, it''s important to understand what is happening during the caramelization
      process and how baking soda is influencing it. As onions cook, they release
      their moisture and cells begin to break down, causing them to soften. Sugars
      are released and as they heat up, both caramelization and a common chemical
      reaction in food occurs, called a Maillard reaction or Maillard browning. Both
      of these create the dark golden brown color we associate with caramelized onions.

      When you add baking soda during cooking it changes the pH which increases the
      Maillard reaction causing the onions to brown more quickly. The'

      How to slowly caramelize onions to bring out deep, rich, sweet flavor as the
      natural sugars in the onions caramelize. Video included.

      Caramelizing onions, by slowly cooking them in a little olive oil until they
      are richly browned, is a wonderful way to pull flavor out of the simplest of
      ingredients.

      Onions are naturally sweet; and as caramel comes from the simple cooking of
      sugar, when you slowly cook onions over an extended period of time, the natural
      sugars in the onions caramelize, making the result intensely and wonderfully
      flavorful.

      You can use onions prepared this way on top of steak, or for onion soup, tarts,
      pizza, or onion dip. Or you can do what I did with this batch, eat it straight
      up. What are your favorite dishes to make that use caramelized onions? Please
      let us know in the comments.

      By the way, I put together a time-lapse video of the caramelization process,
      which you can see at the end of this post. Enjoy!

      Quantities depend on how much caramelized onions you wish to make. In this example,
      5 large raw onions yielded about 2 cups caramelized onions.

        tendency to burn. For insurance, use a combination of butter and oil, which
        has a higher smoking point. But how much do you use? Depending on the consistency
        you want your onions, you can use more or less fat. Just cover the bottom
        of your pan for jammy, soft caramelized onions, or add a little more for more
        structured, slightly charred caramelized onions. The more fat in the pan,
        the more the onions will fry rather than soften. (Okay, you can fry them a
        little.) You can use just oil, or a combination of butter and oil--the choice
        is yours!

      - 'Caramelized Onions Recipe Bon App tit_0 | Learning how to properly caramelize
        onions is key. Once you ve mastered the basic technique, you''ll use them
        for everything from French onion soup to onion dip to topping burgers. Here,
        we break down the process step by step.

        2 large yellow onions, peeled (about 1 pound)

        Low-sodium chicken broth or water (for pan; optional)

        Large SaucepanBuy

        Halve both onions through root end. Using the tip of your knife, cut a V-shaped
        notch around root to remove it (this will ensure that all slices separate
        when you cut the onion).

        Place 1 onion half on your cutting board so root end is facing you, then thinly
        slice onion lengthwise, starting at one side and working all the way to the
        other (so your knife runs through the root halfway through, not starting or
        ending at the root end). You''re going for slices that are  1/4  - 1/8   thick.

        Repeat same slicing procedure for remaining onion halves. It''s a lot of onion!
        But it will cook down quite a bit, so it''s best to start with a large quantity.

        Heat 2 Tbsp. butter in a large saucepan over medium until melted and sizzling.
        You can use a skillet to cook the onions, but a pan with high sides will keep
        the onions from flipping out onto your stove. Using a pan that also has a
        wide base gives water room to evaporate, allowing the onions to caramelize
        rather than steam.

        Instead of dumping in all of the onions at once, which would fill the pot

        Yes, you can caramelize onions quicker!

        Nothing beats the sweet flavor of caramelized onions, but the reward is not
        without a little effort. Truly caramelized onions that are dark brown and
        soft with a flavor as sweet as candy take around 45 minutes to make -- sometimes
        longer. They also need to be watched closely.

        Since not everyone has that kind of time, when we heard about a short-cut,
        we decided we had to try it. Apparently, the trick to getting onions to caramelize
        more quickly is to add baking soda.

        The idea left us both curious and a little skeptical. Caramelized onions are
        a specialty around here, and we are always willing to put in the extra time
        for all that deliciousness. But who are we to deny others from saving time
        in the kitchen?

        Are you curious about this time-saving trick, too? Read on to find out how
        it went in our test kitchen.

        Why baking soda?

        First, it''s important to understand what is happening during the caramelization
        process and how baking soda is influencing it. As onions cook, they release
        their moisture and cells begin to break down, causing them to soften. Sugars
        are released and as they heat up, both caramelization and a common chemical
        reaction in food occurs, called a Maillard reaction or Maillard browning.
        Both of these create the dark golden brown color we associate with caramelized
        onions.

        When you add baking soda during cooking it changes the pH which increases
        the Maillard reaction causing the onions to brown more quickly. The'

        How to slowly caramelize onions to bring out deep, rich, sweet flavor as the
        natural sugars in the onions caramelize. Video included.

        Caramelizing onions, by slowly cooking them in a little olive oil until they
        are richly browned, is a wonderful way to pull flavor out of the simplest
        of ingredients.

        Onions are naturally sweet; and as caramel comes from the simple cooking of
        sugar, when you slowly cook onions over an extended period of time, the natural
        sugars in the onions caramelize, making the result intensely and wonderfully
        flavorful.

        You can use onions prepared this way on top of steak, or for onion soup, tarts,
        pizza, or onion dip. Or you can do what I did with this batch, eat it straight
        up. What are your favorite dishes to make that use caramelized onions? Please

        By the way, I put together a time-lapse video of the caramelization process,

      San Diego is a paradise for kids and adults alike. With nearly perfect weather
      year-round, any time is a good time to visit San Diego.

      The world-renowned San Diego Zoo is a must-see attraction when you''re in town.
      Located within beautiful Balboa Park, your kids will especially love the Giant
      Pandas. Balboa Park is also home to 15 museums, walking trails, a dog park and
      much more. For families, we suggest the San Diego Natural History Museum, the
      San Diego Air & Space Museum, and the Japanese Friendship Garden.

      One of the best ways to experience San Diego is by water. There are many boat
      tours to choose from, but we think there are two that stand above the rest.
      One is the Hornblower cruise, which takes you on a tour of San Diego Bay, where
      you''ll see Naval ships and harbor seals. Our other favorite option for families
      is to take an Adventure Sail on the bay.

      A trip to San Diego wouldn''t be complete without visiting some of the stunning
      beaches. We love Coronado Beach, near the historic Hotel del Coronado, and Sunset
      Cliffs near Point Loma.

      It''s no surprise that Orlando, Florida tops the list of the most kid-friendly
      cities in America! Home to some of the largest theme parks in the country, Orlando

      How To Get Your Child Excited To Play A Musical Instrument

      Getting kids to learn musical instruments can be a daunting task due to the
      immense amounts of discipline and time they require to master. There will be
      hours of practicing that will go into this endeavor, which is far too much effort
      for a kid more interested in the apps on their tablet or playing outdoors with
      their friends.

      However, there are benefits to children learning a musical instrument. Brown
      University has research that shows kids who play instruments have higher IQs
      and do better on standardized tests than those who can''t. An interesting statistic
      also shows that eighty-five percent of people who don''t play an instrument
      wish they had learned, with many of them remembering how they gave up in the
      beginning stages of their lessons due to frustration at learning the basics.

      Learning an instrument can be rewarding, it just requires enthusiasm from the
      child and supportive parents who can help make the learning experience more
      engaging. Motivation and fun are the key concepts in helping your child stick
      with learning an instrument.

      Choose the right instrument.

      Children have amazingly unique personalities, so choosing an instrument should
      be done with them. If you choose an instrument for them without their input,
      chances are they will be more likely to get frustrated and quit, versus an instrument

      Young children are very curious learners; they are open to new experiences especially
      if it is presented in an appealing manner. And, music is one of those things
      that most children love from a very young age. Some say it is innate. From the
      rhythm of mother s heartbeat while in the womb to experiencing the breathing
      patterns on their own, your child has a natural rhythm. You can help your child
      nurture it.

      Parents and teachers often use fun and creative ways of teaching music to young
      children. You really do not need a lot of money to do this, all you need is
      creativity and imagination.

      Here are five simple ways of introducing musical instruments to young kids:

      Use Everyday Objects

      A great way to introduce instruments to young children and teach an important
      musical concept like rhythm is to use everyday objects found in the home or
      classroom and treat it like a percussive instrument.

      Items like small pots and pans, pot covers, metal ladles, wooden spoons, salt
      and pepper shakers, bubble wrap, pencils, pens, rulers, and glass bottles filled
      with varying amounts of water can all be used to create various sounds.

      Introduce Real Instruments

      Whether you plan to start teaching guitar professionally or just want to teach
      your own children, teaching kids to play guitar is different in many ways from
      teaching adults. Choose an instrument that fits the child and start with simple,
      fun songs that the child already knows and will enjoy playing. Keep your focus
      on fun and worry about music theory later.[1]

      Decide on acoustic or electric. You can find child-sized versions of both acoustic
      and electric guitars, and beginner s models typically will be roughly the same
      price. Talk to the child about what kind of music they enjoy and want to play.
      This can help you choose between acoustic and electric.[2]

      Generally, if the child enjoys singer-songwriter, folk, and country music, they
      probably will feel more at home with an acoustic guitar. Kids who are more into
      rock music typically will want an electric guitar.

      Electric guitars can be easier to play than acoustic because the action is lower.
      Since there is less space between the strings and the fretboard, little fingers
      don t have to work as hard to play.

      With electric guitars, you also have the option of plugging headphones into
      the amp for silent practice. This can be helpful if you are concerned about
      disturbing neighbors or other people in the house.

      Get the right size for the child s age. If the guitar is too large for the child,
      playing will be frustrating. Guitars are typically measured by scale. Start

      It''s something we are all touched by. No matter what culture we''re from, everyone
      loves music." - Billy Joel

      Creates Responsibility'
    - 'Music is believed to be the food for the soul. Learning to play a musical instrument
      from an early age is helpful for children in many ways. It enhances their overall
      confidence and makes them learn dedication and patience. However, children cannot
      absorb these benefits by sitting in music classes and nodding along. Kids have
      to engage with music actively in order to enjoy the real perks.

      Here are 10 reasons why you should encourage your little drum-bashing rock star
      to play music every day.

      "Further research has shown that participation in music at an early age can
      improve children''s learning ability and memory by stimulating different patterns
      of brain development," says Maestro Eduardo Marturet, a composer, conductor
      and musical director for the Miami Symphony Orchestra. Learning an instrument
      teaches children how to create, store and retrieve memories more efficiently.

      Practicing music is a creative pursuit. Learning to play an instrument does
      wonders to the creative side of a child''s brain. No matter how much the music
      teacher annotates a composition, they cannot fully express how a piece of music
      should be played. So, it''s upon the learner to put their own stamp on a piece.
      Every time your children hold their instrument to practice something they will
      have to inject a part of their personality into it. This gives kids a healthy
      and composed way to channelize their inner creativity.

      Patience is the highest virtue of living a contented life. Playing a musical
      instrument means having to preserve through hours, days, and possibly years

          Young children are very curious learners; they are open to new experiences
          especially if it is presented in an appealing manner. And, music is one
          of those things that most children love from a very young age. Some say
          it is innate. From the rhythm of mother s heartbeat while in the womb to
          experiencing the breathing patterns on their own, your child has a natural
          rhythm. You can help your child nurture it.

          Parents and teachers often use fun and creative ways of teaching music to
          young children. You really do not need a lot of money to do this, all you
          need is creativity and imagination.

          Here are five simple ways of introducing musical instruments to young kids:

          Use Everyday Objects

          A great way to introduce instruments to young children and teach an important
          musical concept like rhythm is to use everyday objects found in the home
          or classroom and treat it like a percussive instrument.

          Items like small pots and pans, pot covers, metal ladles, wooden spoons,
          salt and pepper shakers, bubble wrap, pencils, pens, rulers, and glass bottles
          filled with varying amounts of water can all be used to create various sounds.

          Introduce Real Instruments

          If you can, borrow some actual percussion instruments like bells, drums,
          maracas, or triangles and allow your child to feel the instruments, interact
          with the instruments on their own, let them discover the'

          Whether you plan to start teaching guitar professionally or just want to
          teach your own children, teaching kids to play guitar is different in many
          ways from teaching adults. Choose an instrument that fits the child and
          start with simple, fun songs that the child already knows and will enjoy
          playing. Keep your focus on fun and worry about music theory later.[1]

          Decide on acoustic or electric. You can find child-sized versions of both
          acoustic and electric guitars, and beginner s models typically will be roughly
          the same price. Talk to the child about what kind of music they enjoy and
          want to play. This can help you choose between acoustic and electric.[2]

          Generally, if the child enjoys singer-songwriter, folk, and country music,
          they probably will feel more at home with an acoustic guitar. Kids who are
          more into rock music typically will want an electric guitar.

          Electric guitars can be easier to play than acoustic because the action
          is lower. Since there is less space between the strings and the fretboard,
          little fingers don t have to work as hard to play.

          With electric guitars, you also have the option of plugging headphones into
          the amp for silent practice. This can be helpful if you are concerned about
          disturbing neighbors or other people in the house.

          Get the right size for the child s age. If the guitar is too large for the
          child, playing will be frustrating. Guitars are typically measured by scale.

      - '10 Reasons Every Child Should Play a Musical Instrument_0 | Music is believed
        to be the food for the soul. Learning to play a musical instrument from an
        early age is helpful for children in many ways. It enhances their overall
        confidence and makes them learn dedication and patience. However, children
        cannot absorb these benefits by sitting in music classes and nodding along.
        Kids have to engage with music actively in order to enjoy the real perks.

        Here are 10 reasons why you should encourage your little drum-bashing rock
        star to play music every day.

        "Further research has shown that participation in music at an early age can
        improve children''s learning ability and memory by stimulating different patterns
        of brain development," says Maestro Eduardo Marturet, a composer, conductor
        and musical director for the Miami Symphony Orchestra. Learning an instrument
        teaches children how to create, store and retrieve memories more efficiently.

        Practicing music is a creative pursuit. Learning to play an instrument does
        wonders to the creative side of a child''s brain. No matter how much the music
        teacher annotates a composition, they cannot fully express how a piece of
        music should be played. So, it''s upon the learner to put their own stamp
        on a piece. Every time your children hold their instrument to practice something
        they will have to inject a part of their personality into it. This gives kids
        a healthy and composed way to channelize their inner creativity.

        Patience is the highest virtue of living a contented life. Playing a musical
        instrument means having to preserve through hours, days, and possibly years
        of practice. It helps children'

      Crusades, military expeditions, beginning in the late 11th century, that were
      organized by western European Christians in response to centuries of Muslim
      wars of expansion. Their objectives were to check the spread of Islam, to retake
      control of the Holy Land in the eastern Mediterranean, to conquer pagan areas,
      and to recapture formerly Christian territories; they were seen by many of their
      participants as a means of redemption and expiation for sins. Between 1095,
      when the First Crusade was launched, and 1291, when the Latin Christians were
      finally expelled from their kingdom in Syria, there were numerous expeditions
      to the Holy Land, to Spain, and even to the Baltic; the Crusades continued for
      several centuries after 1291. Crusading declined rapidly during the 16th century
      with the advent of the Protestant Reformation and the decline of papal authority.

      How many Crusades were there, and when did they take place?

      There were at least eight Crusades. The First Crusade lasted from 1096 to 1099.
      The Second Crusade began in 1147 and ended in 1149. The Third Crusade started
      in 1189 and was concluded in 1192. The Fourth Crusade got underway in 1202 and
      ended in 1204. The Fifth Crusade lasted from 1217 until 1221. The Sixth Crusade
      occurred in 1228-29. The Seventh Crusade began in 1248 and ended in 1254. And
      the Eighth Crusade took place in 1270. There were also smaller Crusades against
      dissident Christian sects within Europe, including the Albigensian Crusade (1209-29).
      The so-called People''s Crusade occurred in response to Pope Urban II''s'

      The Crusades were a series of military expeditions conducted by European Christians
      in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries to conquer the land of Israel from the
      Muslims or to repel their counterattacks.

      The explicit cause was the reports received from Jerusalem concerning the maltreatment
      of Christian pilgrims and the manner in which their access to the Holy Places

      Provided here are various death estimates for the crusades to the east roughly
      covering the period from 1095 to 1291. The extreme range of figures, from one

      or trust such estimates, as they are skeptical of the ability of anyone to count

    - 'How Many Crusades Were There?

      There were eight or nine crusades, though only the first four were of any importance.
      The Crusades were Christian military expeditions mounted to wrest the Holy Land
      from the Muslims who had conquered it.

      The First Crusade began in 1096, led by Peter the Hermit, a French priest. His
      followers were ill-trained and fared badly, but the knights who went to the
      Holy Land at the same time captured Jerusalem.

      However, Jerusalem was lost and the Second Crusade began in 1147. It also failed.
      The Third Crusade was personally led by European rulers. Richard the Lion-Heart
      defeated Saladin and captured Acre, just north of Jerusalem. Historians consider
      the somewhat more successful Fourth Crusade as purely mercenary.

      The other Crusades, including the notorious Children s Crusade, failed, and
      the Holy Land remained under Muslim control.

      In general, the Church found Muslim control of Christian holy places in Eretz
      Israel intolerable, especially when reports came from Jerusalem of harassment
      of Christians visiting the holy sites. As such, in 1095 Pope Urban II called
      for an army of Christians to conquer Eretz Israel from its Muslim rulers. Indeed,
      that Christians viewed Islam as a threat was hardly new. In the Eighth Century,
      for example, Muslims captured Spain and made inroads into France, before being
      defeated by Charles Martel s Frankish army. Slowly, the Christians fought back,
      beginning the reconquest of Spain. When the legendary Spaniard El Cid retook
      the important Spanish city of Valencia from the Muslims, the Christian world
      was greatly encouraged, feeling that the time was ripe to strike at the Muslim
      world. In addition, the Church saw as its mission spreading Christian rule,
      which they termed the  Kingdom of G-d,  over the heathen infidel.

      On a more secular level, the possibility of attaining great wealth through conquest
      was a strong attraction. Northwestern Europe had been devastated by bad harvests
      in the autumn of 1095, and the crusading impulse rescued many serfs and landowners
      from desperate economic straits. The population had markedly increased in the
      previous century, and a spirit of restlessness took hold among the masses. Many
      people were tantalized by the prospect'

          Crusades, military expeditions, beginning in the late 11th century, that
          were organized by western European Christians in response to centuries of
          Muslim wars of expansion. Their objectives were to check the spread of Islam,
          to retake control of the Holy Land in the eastern Mediterranean, to conquer
          pagan areas, and to recapture formerly Christian territories; they were
          seen by many of their participants as a means of redemption and expiation
          for sins. Between 1095, when the First Crusade was launched, and 1291, when
          the Latin Christians were finally expelled from their kingdom in Syria,
          there were numerous expeditions to the Holy Land, to Spain, and even to
          the Baltic; the Crusades continued for several centuries after 1291. Crusading
          declined rapidly during the 16th century with the advent of the Protestant
          Reformation and the decline of papal authority.

          How many Crusades were there, and when did they take place?

          There were at least eight Crusades. The First Crusade lasted from 1096 to
          1099. The Second Crusade began in 1147 and ended in 1149. The Third Crusade
          started in 1189 and was concluded in 1192. The Fourth Crusade got underway
          in 1202 and ended in 1204. The Fifth Crusade lasted from 1217 until 1221.
          The Sixth Crusade occurred in 1228-29. The Seventh Crusade began in 1248
          and ended in 1254. And the Eighth Crusade took place in 1270. There were
          also smaller Crusades against dissident Christian sects within Europe, including

        There were eight or nine crusades, though only the first four were of any
        importance. The Crusades were Christian military expeditions mounted to wrest
        the Holy Land from the Muslims who had conquered it.

        The First Crusade began in 1096, led by Peter the Hermit, a French priest.
        His followers were ill-trained and fared badly, but the knights who went to
        the Holy Land at the same time captured Jerusalem.

        However, Jerusalem was lost and the Second Crusade began in 1147. It also
        failed. The Third Crusade was personally led by European rulers. Richard the
        Lion-Heart defeated Saladin and captured Acre, just north of Jerusalem. Historians
        consider the somewhat more successful Fourth Crusade as purely mercenary.

        The other Crusades, including the notorious Children s Crusade, failed, and
        the Holy Land remained under Muslim control.

        In general, the Church found Muslim control of Christian holy places in Eretz
        Israel intolerable, especially when reports came from Jerusalem of harassment
        of Christians visiting the holy sites. As such, in 1095 Pope Urban II called
        for an army of Christians to conquer Eretz Israel from its Muslim rulers.
        Indeed, that Christians viewed Islam as a threat was hardly new. In the Eighth
        Century, for example, Muslims captured Spain and made inroads into France,
        before being defeated by Charles Martel s Frankish army. Slowly, the Christians
        fought back, beginning the reconquest of Spain. When the legendary Spaniard
        El Cid retook the important Spanish city of Valencia from the Muslims, the
        Christian world was greatly encouraged, feeling that the time was ripe to
        strike at the Muslim world. In addition, the Church saw as its mission spreading
        Christian rule, which they termed the  Kingdom of G-d,  over the heathen infidel.

        On a more secular level, the possibility of attaining great wealth through
        conquest was a strong attraction. Northwestern Europe had been devastated
        by bad harvests in the autumn of 1095, and the crusading impulse rescued many
        serfs and landowners from desperate economic straits. The population had markedly
        increased in the previous century, and a spirit of restlessness took hold
        among the masses. Many people were tantalized by the prospect'

          Crusades, military expeditions, beginning in the late 11th century, that
          were organized by western European Christians in response to centuries of
          Muslim wars of expansion. Their objectives were to check the spread of Islam,
          to retake control of the Holy Land in the eastern Mediterranean, to conquer
          pagan areas, and to recapture formerly Christian territories; they were
          seen by many of their participants as a means of redemption and expiation
          for sins. Between 1095, when the First Crusade was launched, and 1291, when
          the Latin Christians were finally expelled from their kingdom in Syria,
          there were numerous expeditions to the Holy Land, to Spain, and even to
          the Baltic; the Crusades continued for several centuries after 1291. Crusading
          declined rapidly during the 16th century with the advent of the Protestant
          Reformation and the decline of papal authority.

          How many Crusades were there, and when did they take place?

          There were at least eight Crusades. The First Crusade lasted from 1096 to
          1099. The Second Crusade began in 1147 and ended in 1149. The Third Crusade
          started in 1189 and was concluded in 1192. The Fourth Crusade got underway
          in 1202 and ended in 1204. The Fifth Crusade lasted from 1217 until 1221.
          The Sixth Crusade occurred in 1228-29. The Seventh Crusade began in 1248
          and ended in 1254. And the Eighth Crusade took place in 1270. There were
          also smaller Crusades against dissident Christian sects within Europe, including
          the Albigensian Crusade (1209-29). The so-called People''s Crusade occurred

        There were eight or nine crusades, though only the first four were of any
        importance. The Crusades were Christian military expeditions mounted to wrest
        the Holy Land from the Muslims who had conquered it.

        The First Crusade began in 1096, led by Peter the Hermit, a French priest.
        His followers were ill-trained and fared badly, but the knights who went to
        the Holy Land at the same time captured Jerusalem.

        However, Jerusalem was lost and the Second Crusade began in 1147. It also
        failed. The Third Crusade was personally led by European rulers. Richard the
        Lion-Heart defeated Saladin and captured Acre, just north of Jerusalem. Historians
        consider the somewhat more successful Fourth Crusade as purely mercenary.

        The other Crusades, including the notorious Children s Crusade, failed, and
        the Holy Land remained under Muslim control.

        In general, the Church found Muslim control of Christian holy places in Eretz
        Israel intolerable, especially when reports came from Jerusalem of harassment
        of Christians visiting the holy sites. As such, in 1095 Pope Urban II called
        for an army of Christians to conquer Eretz Israel from its Muslim rulers.
        Indeed, that Christians viewed Islam as a threat was hardly new. In the Eighth
        Century, for example, Muslims captured Spain and made inroads into France,
        before being defeated by Charles Martel s Frankish army. Slowly, the Christians
        fought back, beginning the reconquest of Spain. When the legendary Spaniard
        El Cid retook the important Spanish city of Valencia from the Muslims, the
        Christian world was greatly encouraged, feeling that the time was ripe to
        strike at the Muslim world. In addition, the Church saw as its mission spreading
        Christian rule, which they termed the  Kingdom of G-d,  over the heathen infidel.

        On a more secular level, the possibility of attaining great wealth through
        conquest was a strong attraction. Northwestern Europe had been devastated
        by bad harvests in the autumn of 1095, and the crusading impulse rescued many
        serfs and landowners from desperate economic straits. The population had markedly
        increased in the previous century, and a spirit of restlessness took hold
        among the masses. Many people were tantalized by the prospect'
