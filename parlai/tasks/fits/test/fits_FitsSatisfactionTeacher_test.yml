      favorite new potatoes are fried, or steamed together with fresh peas: YUM! If

      The Best Soil For Growing Potatoes

      To grow a successful crop of potatoes, you need to have good, rich soil, as
      this is a hungry crop. With the right food, plenty of water, and a feed during
      the growing season, you should get a healthy crop of potatoes.

      Here''s how to prepare the soil for growing potatoes: in the fall, work on the
      land by digging or rototilling and incorporating plenty of well-rotted manure.
      This will also help preparing the soil for other root vegetables as well.

      You should add the well-rotted manure either in the fall preceding the next
      year''s crop, or in the spring just before planting. The advantage of adding
      manure in the fall is that worms will have a chance to draw the manure lower
      into the soil. Then, double dig the manure in, and your soil will be in perfect
      condition for potatoes.

      Even with this heavy feeding you should also add garden compost or leaf mold
      in the spring, so that the soil will retain more water and help with the development
      of your potatoes.

      You can plant your potatoes in trenches, and as an additional fertilizer dress
      the trench with a Fish, Blood and Bone food and line the trench with seaweed.

      I always look forward to harvesting potatoes in the fall. It is like finding
      buried treasure. With all the colors and varieties I like to plant, my potatoes
      are like easter eggs. The taste of a home grown potato can''t be beat. This
      is an easy crop for you to grow, even if you don''t have great soil, a lot of
      time, or even a lot of space.

      Sometimes I am gone commercial fishing for a big chunk of the summer, or really
      busy with other projects. No matter what else is going on in my life, I always
      throw at least a few potatoes into the ground.

      Why Grow Potatoes?

      There is a huge difference in taste and texture between home grown and store
      bought potatoes. Conventional potatoes have been bred for a high yield per acre
      and uniform shape. The flavor has suffered as a result. Potatoes from the store
      are much more bland and mealy.

      I used to drown potatoes in butter and salt. However, my own home grown potatoes
      have such a rich flavor and texture, I use much less salt and skip the butter.
      You could see this as a health benefit, if you are trying to cut down on sodium
      and fat.

      Better For Your Health

      According to Jo Robinson''s landmark work "Eating on the Wild Side," modern
      varieties of potatoes such as Russets and Yukon Golds are high glycemic. This
      means the sugar in them is digested so quickly it causes a spike in blood sugar.

    - '7 Ways to Grow Potatoes in Every Kind of Yard

      Digging trenches isn t the only way to go.

      A few years ago, I conducted a test: I grew German Butterball potatoes using
      seven different planting methods. Through the course of the growing season,
      the benefits and drawbacks of each became quite clear.

      Read on to discover which ones worked the best, and which ones delivered subpar
      results.

      1. Cheapest: Hilled Rows

      Dig straight, shallow trenches, 2 to 3 feet apart, in prepared soil. Plant seed
      potatoes 12 inches apart and cover with about 3 inches of soil. When the shoots
      reach 10 to 12 inches tall, use a hoe or shovel to scoop soil from between rows
      and mound it against the plants, burying the stems halfway. Repeat as needed
      through the growing season to keep the tubers covered.

      Unlike container gardening, there s nothing to buy or build and no soil to transport.
      This is a simple, inexpensive, and proven method that farmers have used for
      millennia. It s practical for large-scale plantings, also.

      However, the quality of the soil may limit the yield. In places where the dirt
      badly compacted or low in organic matter, an above-ground technique might work
      better.

      Here s a video that shows this potato-planting method:

      2. Least Digging: Straw Mulch

      Place seed potatoes on the surface of prepared soil following the spacing specified
      for hilled rows and cover them with 3 to 4 inches of loose, seed-free straw.
      Mound more straw around the stems as they grow, eventually creating a layer
      of one foot or more in depth.

      7 steps for planting, harvesting and storing potatoes at home By Kevin Lee Jacobs

      Potatoes are generous plants. They are easy to grow and produce abundant harvests.
      Give them the following and they will accept almost any planting situation:

      Loose, fertile soil

      1" of water per week

      You can grow potatoes in a plastic bucket, a plastic trash can, or a special
      "grow bag". But in my experience, containers like these require constant attention
      to watering, and yield only tiny harvests. A better plan is to grow your crop
      in a raised bed.

      RELATED: How to build your own raised bed

      I achieve an enormous harvest--enough to feed two for nearly a year--by planting
      potatoes in two 4 -x-8  raised beds. The tubers are wildly productive in the
      well-draining, rock-free soil the beds provide, and the vines require deep watering
      only once each week.

      Of all the root vegetables I grow, it is the potatoes that give me the biggest
      thrill at harvest time. I love to stick my hands in the soil and retrieve the
      buried bounty, with a yield of eight to ten potatoes for every one that I plant.

      However you decide to grow your potatoes, the planting directions are the same.

      How to Do the Perfect Lunge

      If you''ve ever knelt down to tie your shoe or seen someone propose on bended
      knee, you re familiar with a lunge. A lunge is a single-leg bodyweight exercise
      that works your hips, glutes, quads, hamstrings, core, and the hard-to-reach
      muscles of the inner thigh.

      Lunges can help you develop lower-body strength and endurance, and unlike squats,
      they are highly effective at evening out muscle imbalances. They re also a great
      beginner move. Why? Because you pretty much do them daily (they mimic our walking
      pattern).

      Ready to take the lunge? Master the move by following the steps below from personal
      trainer Greg Nieratka. Then keep reading to learn how to fix common mistakes
      and try some variations.

      1. Stand tall with feet hip-width apart. Engage core.

      2. Take a big step forward with right leg and start to shift weight forward
      so heel hits the floor first.

      3. Lower body until right thigh is parallel to floor and right shin is vertical
      (it s okay if knee shifts forward a little as long as it doesn t go past right
      toe). If mobility allows, lightly tap left knee to ground while keeping weight
      in right heel.

      4. Press into right heel to drive back up to starting position.

      5. Repeat on the other side.

    - 'Lunges: You re Doing Them Wrong

      Master the Lunge and Split Squat

      Everything You Need to Know About Lunges

      The lunge or split squat is one of the most popular lower body exercises. The
      problem? Most people, including many  expert trainers,  do them improperly,
      negating the benefits. Here s how to master them.

      1 - Strengthen Your Feet First

      Teaching someone to lunge who barely has the ability to balance on one leg makes
      about as much sense as having someone who can t hold a plank do ring push-ups.
      Build your foundation first. For lunges, that foundation begins with the feet
      and ankles.

      Either go barefoot or use minimalist shoes when doing lunges. Nothing will degrade
      lunge mechanics more than clunky shoes with exaggerated foot and ankle support.
      Once you ve built enough foot and ankle strength, few exercises do more for
      improving foot and ankle mechanics than barefoot lunges.

      2 - Lean Forward

      Most people think a lunge is an upright movement with the torso perpendicular
      to the ground throughout. But that s flawed mechanics. Maintaining a forward
      torso lean onto the heel of the front leg is essential.

      In fact, this may be the most critical cue. It ensures the hips are pushed back
      posteriorly and actively engaged throughout the exercise. A good lunge involves
      solid hip hinge mechanics. An overly upright torso places greater stress on
      the knees and low back while minimizing stress to the glutes and upper thighs.
      That s not what you want.

      3 - Move Straight Up and Down

      Tips on How to Get the Most Out of Your Lunge Training

      Why Lunge Training?

      Lunges are a unilateral leg training exercise that can build strength, address
      movement and muscle imbalances, and enhance bilateral squatting, deadliting,
      and athletic movements.

      Strength, power, and fitness athletes can integrate lunges into programs in
      numerous of ways (see last section below). Powerlifters, strongman, and weightlifters
      can select lunges as part of a mass building phase to adding training volume
      or as a strength movement to swap out with lunges to decreased overall loading
      to the body yet still challenge the lower body.

      For general fitness and everyday athletes, lunges can help with movement, coordination,
      and unilateral strength; all of which are important in actions like walking,
      running, jumping, and bilateral leg training (squats, deadlifts, jumps, etc).

      Watch Now: How To Do a Static Lunge

      Static lunges are great for working all the major muscles of the hips, glutes,
      and thighs. In this version of lunges, you re simply dropping your knee down
      rather than stepping forward or back. For beginners, you can try this move while
      holding onto a chair or wall for balance. Do it right:

      Stand with right foot forward, left foot back about 3 feet apart.

      Hold weights in each hand if desired and bend the knees to lower the body towards
      the floor. Keep the front knee behind the toes and be sure to lower straight
      down rather than forward.

      Keep the torso straight and abs in as you push through the front heel and back
      to starting position.

      Don t lock the knees at the top of the movement.

      Assisted Lunges

      Like static lunges, assisted lunges work all the muscles of the hips, glutes,
      and thighs. This version is just like a static lunge, except you re using a
      chair or wall for balance. This is a great way for beginners to practice lunges
      without losing their balance. Do it right:

      Hold onto a chair or wall for balance.

      Bend the knees and lower them towards the floor until the back knee is a few
      inches from the floor and the front knee is at a right angle. Keep the front
      knee behind the toes and be sure to lower straight down rather than forward.

    - 'Video: Lunge exercise

      Dr. Laskowski: The lunge is a body resistance exercise that works the leg muscles.
      Specifically, the lunge targets the quadriceps and the hamstring muscles in
      the thigh, the gluteal muscles in the buttock, and to a lesser extent, the lower
      leg muscles. The lunge is a great conditioning exercise for many sports, especially
      those that involve lunging movements, such as tennis, basketball or soccer.

      Nicole Krupa: To do a stationary lunge, start by standing up comfortably. Step
      ahead with one foot and lean forward until your knee reaches a 90-degree angle
      and your rear knee is parallel to the ground. Then return to the starting position.
      You ll feel some tension in your legs.

      When you re doing lunges, keep your back in a neutral position, but don t flatten
      the curve of your lower back, and don t arch your back in the other direction.
      Make sure that your knee doesn t go beyond your toes and that your knee stays
      centered over your foot. Don t let your knee roll inward or outward.

      If you can t lower your knee to a 90-degree angle, simply go as low as you can.
      Do as many repetitions as you can, depending on your fitness level. Stop when
      you re fatigued or your form begins to suffer.

      For a variety, try a traveling lunge. Simply step ahead with the opposite foot
      rather than return to the starting position.

      Remember, for best results, keep your back in a neutral position and let your

          The lunge is a movement used by most strength, power, and fitness athletes
          to increase leg strength, squatting and pulling abilities, increase unilateral
          performance, and increase injury resilience. The lunge has a wide array
          of variations that can be programmed to fit the specific needs of an athlete

          Lunges are a unilateral leg training exercise that can build strength, address
          movement and muscle imbalances, and enhance bilateral squatting, deadliting,
          and athletic movements.

          Strength, power, and fitness athletes can integrate lunges into programs
          in numerous of ways (see last section below). Powerlifters, strongman, and
          weightlifters can select lunges as part of a mass building phase to adding
          training volume or as a strength movement to swap out with lunges to decreased
          overall loading to the body yet still challenge the lower body.

          For general fitness and everyday athletes, lunges can help with movement,
          coordination, and unilateral strength; all of which are important in actions
          like walking, running, jumping, and bilateral leg training (squats, deadlifts,
          jumps, etc).

        How to Do the Perfect Forward Lunge

        July 14, 2016 | By Molly Ritterbeck

        How to Do the Perfect Lunge

        If you''ve ever knelt down to tie your shoe or seen someone propose on bended
        knee, you re familiar with a lunge. A lunge is a single-leg bodyweight exercise
        that works your hips, glutes, quads, hamstrings, core, and the hard-to-reach
        muscles of the inner thigh.

        Lunges can help you develop lower-body strength and endurance, and unlike
        squats, they are highly effective at evening out muscle imbalances. They re
        also a great beginner move. Why? Because you pretty much do them daily (they
        mimic our walking pattern).

        Ready to take the lunge? Master the move by following the steps below from
        personal trainer Greg Nieratka. Then keep reading to learn how to fix common
        mistakes and try some variations.

        1. Stand tall with feet hip-width apart. Engage core.

        2. Take a big step forward with right leg and start to shift weight forward
        so heel hits the floor first.

        3. Lower body until right thigh is parallel to floor and right shin is vertical
        (it s okay if knee shifts forward a little as long as it doesn t go past right
        toe). If mobility allows, lightly tap left knee to ground while keeping weight
        in right heel.

        4. Press into right heel to drive back up to starting position.

        5. Repeat on the other side.

        Watch Now: How To Do a Static Lunge

        Static lunges are great for working all the major muscles of the hips, glutes,
        and thighs. In this version of lunges, you re simply dropping your knee down
        rather than stepping forward or back. For beginners, you can try this move
        while holding onto a chair or wall for balance. Do it right:

        Stand with right foot forward, left foot back about 3 feet apart.

        Hold weights in each hand if desired and bend the knees to lower the body
        towards the floor. Keep the front knee behind the toes and be sure to lower
        straight down rather than forward.

        Keep the torso straight and abs in as you push through the front heel and
        back to starting position.

        Don t lock the knees at the top of the movement.

        Assisted Lunges

        Like static lunges, assisted lunges work all the muscles of the hips, glutes,
        and thighs. This version is just like a static lunge, except you re using
        a chair or wall for balance. This is a great way for beginners to practice
        lunges without losing their balance. Do it right:

        Hold onto a chair or wall for balance.

        Bend the knees and lower them towards the floor until the back knee is a few
        inches from the floor and the front knee is at a right angle. Keep the front
        knee behind the toes and be sure to lower straight down rather than forward.

        Dr. Laskowski: The lunge is a body resistance exercise that works the leg
        muscles. Specifically, the lunge targets the quadriceps and the hamstring
        muscles in the thigh, the gluteal muscles in the buttock, and to a lesser
        extent, the lower leg muscles. The lunge is a great conditioning exercise
        for many sports, especially those that involve lunging movements, such as
        tennis, basketball or soccer.

        Nicole Krupa: To do a stationary lunge, start by standing up comfortably.
        Step ahead with one foot and lean forward until your knee reaches a 90-degree
        angle and your rear knee is parallel to the ground. Then return to the starting
        position. You ll feel some tension in your legs.

        When you re doing lunges, keep your back in a neutral position, but don t
        flatten the curve of your lower back, and don t arch your back in the other
        direction. Make sure that your knee doesn t go beyond your toes and that your
        knee stays centered over your foot. Don t let your knee roll inward or outward.

        If you can t lower your knee to a 90-degree angle, simply go as low as you
        can. Do as many repetitions as you can, depending on your fitness level. Stop
        when you re fatigued or your form begins to suffer.

        For a variety, try a traveling lunge. Simply step ahead with the opposite
        foot rather than return to the starting position.

        Remember, for best results, keep your back in a neutral position and let your
        knee follow your foot on the way down.'

      Home > Edible Gardens > Herbs > Basil

      Image by ManoAfrica

      There''s nothing like the scent and flavor of fresh basil. Basil is native to
      India but has been cultivated for centuries in the Mediterranean and South Asian
      countries. Caring for a basil plant isn''t tricky but it does have specific
      watering needs that vary from the time it is a little sprout to when it matures
      to a large bush. A few basil watering tips are described in detail below.

      Basil is a tender annual that will not survive in zones below USDA zone 10,
      but it grows beautifully as a summer annual in all zones down to 4. Basil is
      generally planted in May, but you can start it earlier indoors. The plant needs
      well-drained soil with at least six to eight hours of bright sunlight per day.
      The best growth is achieved with 10 to 12 hours of light per day, but this can
      lead to the plant drying out if it is potted. Knowing how to water basil plants
      will help ensure a high yield of the flavorful leaves over the entire season.

      Watering a Basil Plant

      Basil starts should be sown at least six to eight weeks before planting out.
      In regions with short growing seasons, this should be even earlier for fully
      producing plants. While considered an annual, you can grow basil in a container
      and bring it indoors for longer production.

      Eventually, this tender herb will flower and die even as a houseplant. Flowering
      is discouraged, as it'

      Basil ; ("Ocimum basilicum"), also called great basil or Saint-Joseph''s-wort,
      is a culinary herb of the family Lamiaceae (mints). The name "basil" comes from
      Latin, "Basilius", and Greek basilikon phuton ("basilikon phuton"), "royal/kingly
      plant".

      Basil is native to tropical regions from central Africa to Southeast Asia. It
      is a tender plant, and is used in cuisines worldwide. Depending on the species
      and cultivar, the leaves may taste somewhat like anise, with a strong, pungent,
      often sweet smell.

      There are many varieties of "Ocimum basilicum", as well as several related species
      or hybrids also called basil. The type used commonly as a flavor is typically
      called sweet basil (or Genovese basil), as opposed to Thai basil ("O. basilicum"
      var. "thyrsiflora"), lemon basil ("O. x citriodorum"), and holy basil ("Ocimum
      tenuiflorum"). While most common varieties of basil are treated as annuals,
      some are perennial in warm, tropical climates, including holy basil and a cultivar
      known as "African blue basil".

      The word "basil" derives from Latin ("Basilius"), then Greek basileus ("basileus"),
      meaning "king" (Greek, Basileios).

      Most basils are cultivars of sweet basil.

      Basil is most commonly used fresh in recipes. In general, it is added at the
      last moment, as cooking quickly destroys the flavor. The fresh herb can be kept
      for a short time in plastic bags in the refrigerator, or for a longer period
      in the freezer, after being blanched quickly in boiling water. The dried herb
      also loses most of its flavor, and what little flavor remains tastes very different,
      with a weak coumarin flavor, like hay.

      surprise you is the many benefits of basil that make it well-known for its immunity-enhancing

      identified in holy basil within its seeds, roots, leaves and stem. Holy basil,
      which has the scientific name Ocimum sanctum L. or Ocimum tenuiflorum L., is
      known to be an anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and powerful adaptogen -- meaning
      it helps the body to respond to stress and fight disease.

      Basil is an important medicinal plant in various traditional and folk systems
      of medicines, such as those in Southeast Asia and India. Holy basil is usually
      referred to as tulsi in India and is actually considered a sacred herb. It''s

      Yes, I would love to help you.

      Ok, I am trying to grow the herb basil but don''t know where to start. What
      materials do I need to grow basil indoors?

      Basil needs nutrient-rich soil that is able to drain water easily in order to
      grow into a healthy plant. You can find well-draining potting soil at a garden
      store, as well as online. Fill 3/4 of a container with the soil. The container
      should offer sufficient drainage.

      Ok, how much light does it need?

      It needs at least six to eight hours of bright sunlight per day. The best growth
      is achieved with 10 to 12 hours of light per day, but this can lead to the plant
      drying out if it is potted.

      Ok, how much water does it need?

      It depends on the type of basil. There are many varieties of basil, such as
      sweet basil, lemon basil, and holy basil.'

      U.N. Bodies

      U.N. Members

      U.N. Successes

      United Nations Criticisms

      U.N. Failures

      The United Nations (U.N.) is a global diplomatic and political organization
      dedicated to international peace and stability. The U.N. was officially established
      in 1945 following the horrific events of World War II, when international leaders
      proposed creating a new global organization to maintain peace and avoid the
      abuses of war. The U.N. initially had just 51 member states; today, the organization,
      which is headquartered in New York City, has 193 members. Major U.N. initiatives
      include preventing conflict by exploring options to ensure peace, providing
      food and medical assistance in emergencies, and offering humanitarian support
      to millions of people around the world. While the United Nations is sometimes
      criticized for its policies, bureaucracy and spending, the organization has
      accomplished hundreds of successful peacekeeping missions.

      After World War I, an international group developed the League of Nations to
      solve disputes between countries. When World War II started, the initiative
      failed but highlighted the need for a new, reformed organization that could
      promote global peace.

      In August 1941, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill held a secret meeting
      where they discussed the possibility of starting an international peace effort.
      They came up with a declaration called the Atlantic Charter, which outlined
      ideal goals of war and paved the way for the development of the U.N.

      The United States joined the war in December 1941, and the title "United Nations"
      was first adopted to identify the countries that allied against Germany, Italy
      and Japan.

      Representatives from 26 Allied nations met in Washington, D.C.'
    - 'The Founding of the United Nations (1945)

      The Founding of the United Nations

      The United Nations was founded in 1945 after the devastation of World War II
      and replaced the defunct League of Nations. The League of Nations had failed
      to prevent the devastation that ravaged the world from 1939-45 due to key flaws
      in how the organisation provided for international relations between states.
      The term  United Nations  was first officially adopted by 26 countries who pledged
      to continue the war effort with the signing of the Atlantic Charter in January
      1942. During the war the term  United Nations  was used to describe the Allies
      and their alliance.

      In the aftermath of World War II the International community recognized the
      need to avoid a future world war at all costs. The vast physical and economic
      destruction of the war motivated nations to agree to the formation of a new
      world organisation led primarily by the Allied countries. The United States
      was the first country to adopt a plan for world cooperation after its failure
      to join the League of Nations had left the organisation powerless. The League
      of Nations had strongly depended on the collective security of nations and the
      failure of the United States to join had destroyed it legitimacy in preventing
      international conflict. The name  United Nations  was created by President Franklin
      D. Roosevelt in the  Declaration by the United Nations'' of 1st January, 1942
      during the Second World War. As a result the United Nations was established

    - 'Rotary at the start of the United Nations

      Rotary and the United Nations have a shared history of working toward peace
      and addressing humanitarian issues around the world.

      Rotary s presentation of the United Nations charter,  From Here On!

      During World War II, Rotary informed and educated members about the formation
      of the United Nations and the importance of planning for peace. Materials such
      as the booklet "From Here On!" and articles in The Rotarian helped members understand
      the UN before it was formally established and follow its work after its charter.

      Many countries were fighting the war when the term "United Nations" was first
      used officially in the 1942 "Declaration by United Nations." The 26 nations
      that signed it pledged to uphold the ideals expressed by the United States and
      the United Kingdom the previous year of the common principles "on which they
      based their hopes for a better future for the world."

      Officials from Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States met in
      Moscow in 1943 and called for the creation of an international organization
      to maintain peace and security.

      The next year, representatives of those countries plus China held conferences
      in Washington, D.C., to discuss how to go about this monumental task. Those
      sessions became known as the Dumbarton Oaks conference, where delegations from
      the four countries developed a proposal for the structure of the new organization.

      After the conference, Rotary published "What Can Rotarians Do Following Dumbarton
      Oaks?" It included the proposed charter, talking points, and suggestions for

          The United Nations (U.N.) is a global diplomatic and political organization
          dedicated to international peace and stability. The U.N. was officially
          established in 1945 following the horrific events of World War II, when
          international leaders proposed creating a new global organization to maintain
          peace and avoid the abuses of war. The U.N. initially had just 51 member
          states; today, the organization, which is headquartered in New York City,
          has 193 members. Major U.N. initiatives include preventing conflict by exploring
          options to ensure peace, providing food and medical assistance in emergencies,
          and offering humanitarian support to millions of people around the world.
          While the United Nations is sometimes criticized for its policies, bureaucracy
          and spending, the organization has accomplished hundreds of successful peacekeeping
          missions.

          After World War I, an international group developed the League of Nations
          to solve disputes between countries. When World War II started, the initiative
          failed but highlighted the need for a new, reformed organization that could
          promote global peace.

          In August 1941, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill held a secret
          meeting where they discussed the possibility of starting an international
          peace effort. They came up with a declaration called the Atlantic Charter,
          which outlined ideal goals of war and paved the way for the development
          of the U.N.

        The Founding of the United Nations

        The United Nations was founded in 1945 after the devastation of World War
        II and replaced the defunct League of Nations. The League of Nations had failed
        to prevent the devastation that ravaged the world from 1939-45 due to key
        flaws in how the organisation provided for international relations between
        states. The term  United Nations  was first officially adopted by 26 countries
        who pledged to continue the war effort with the signing of the Atlantic Charter
        in January 1942. During the war the term  United Nations  was used to describe
        the Allies and their alliance.

        In the aftermath of World War II the International community recognized the
        need to avoid a future world war at all costs. The vast physical and economic
        destruction of the war motivated nations to agree to the formation of a new
        world organisation led primarily by the Allied countries. The United States
        was the first country to adopt a plan for world cooperation after its failure
        to join the League of Nations had left the organisation powerless. The League
        of Nations had strongly depended on the collective security of nations and
        the failure of the United States to join had destroyed it legitimacy in preventing
        international conflict. The name  United Nations  was created by President
        Franklin D. Roosevelt in the  Declaration by the United Nations'' of 1st January,
        1942 during the Second World War. As a result the United Nations was established

        understand the UN before it was formally established and follow its work after
        its charter.

        Many countries were fighting the war when the term "United Nations" was first
        used officially in the 1942 "Declaration by United Nations." The 26 nations
        that signed it pledged to uphold the ideals expressed by the United States
        and the United Kingdom the previous year of the common principles "on which
        they based their hopes for a better future for the world."

        Officials from Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States met
        in Moscow in 1943 and called for the creation of an international organization
        to maintain peace and security.

        The next year, representatives of those countries plus China held conferences
        in Washington, D.C., to discuss how to go about this monumental task. Those
        sessions became known as the Dumbarton Oaks conference, where delegations
        from the four countries developed a proposal for the structure of the new
        organization.

        After the conference, Rotary published "What Can Rotarians Do Following Dumbarton
        Oaks?" It included the proposed charter, talking points, and suggestions for
        discussing with club members how the United Nations'

          The United Nations (U.N.) is a global diplomatic and political organization
          dedicated to international peace and stability. The U.N. was officially
          established in 1945 following the horrific events of World War II, when
          international leaders proposed creating a new global organization to maintain
          peace and avoid the abuses of war. The U.N. initially had just 51 member
          states; today, the organization, which is headquartered in New York City,
          has 193 members. Major U.N. initiatives include preventing conflict by exploring
          options to ensure peace, providing food and medical assistance in emergencies,
          and offering humanitarian support to millions of people around the world.
          While the United Nations is sometimes criticized for its policies, bureaucracy
          and spending, the organization has accomplished hundreds of successful peacekeeping
          missions.

          After World War I, an international group developed the League of Nations
          to solve disputes between countries. When World War II started, the initiative
          failed but highlighted the need for a new, reformed organization that could
          promote global peace.

          In August 1941, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill held a secret
          meeting where they discussed the possibility of starting an international
          peace effort. They came up with a declaration called the Atlantic Charter,
          which outlined ideal goals of war and paved the way for the development
          of the U.N.

          The United States joined the war in December 1941, and the title "United
          Nations" was first adopted to identify the countries that allied against
          Germany, Italy and Japan.

        Nations is sometimes criticized for its policies, bureaucracy and spending,
        the organization has accomplished hundreds of successful peacekeeping missions.

        After World War I, an international group developed the League of Nations
        to solve disputes between countries. When World War II started, the initiative
        failed but highlighted the need for a new, reformed organization that could
        promote global peace.

        In August 1941, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill held a secret
        meeting where they discussed the possibility of starting an international
        peace effort. They came up with a declaration called the Atlantic Charter,
        which outlined ideal goals of war and paved the way for the development of
        the U.N.

        The United States joined the war in December 1941, and the title "United Nations"
        was first adopted to identify the countries that allied against Germany, Italy
        and Japan.

        Representatives from 26 Allied nations met in Washington, D.C.'

        The Founding of the United Nations

        The United Nations was founded in 1945 after the devastation of World War
        II and replaced the defunct League of Nations. The League of Nations had failed
        to prevent the devastation that ravaged the world from 1939-45 due to key
        flaws in how the organisation provided for international relations between
        states. The term  United Nations  was first officially adopted by 26 countries
        who pledged to continue the war effort with the signing of the Atlantic Charter
        in January 1942. During the war the term  United Nations  was used to describe
        the Allies and their alliance.

        In the aftermath of World War II the International community recognized the
        need to avoid a future world war at all costs. The vast physical and economic
        destruction of the war motivated nations to agree to the formation of a new
        world organisation led primarily by the Allied countries. The United States
        was the first country to adopt a plan for world cooperation after its failure
        to join the League of Nations had left the organisation powerless. The League
        of Nations had strongly depended on the collective security of nations and
        the failure of the United States to join had destroyed it legitimacy in preventing
        international conflict. The name  United Nations  was created by President
        Franklin D. Roosevelt in the  Declaration by the United Nations'' of 1st January,
        1942 during the Second World War. As a result the United Nations was established
        with the'

        United Nations

        Rotary and the United Nations have a shared history of working toward peace
        and addressing humanitarian issues around the world.

        Rotary s presentation of the United Nations charter,  From Here On!

        During World War II, Rotary informed and educated members about the formation
        of the United Nations and the importance of planning for peace. Materials
        such as the booklet "From Here On!" and articles in The Rotarian helped members
        understand the UN before it was formally established and follow its work after
        its charter.

        Many countries were fighting the war when the term "United Nations" was first
        used officially in the 1942 "Declaration by United Nations." The 26 nations
        that signed it pledged to uphold the ideals expressed by the United States
        and the United Kingdom the previous year of the common principles "on which
        they based their hopes for a better future for the world."

        Officials from Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States met
        in Moscow in 1943 and called for the creation of an international organization
        to maintain peace and security.

        The next year, representatives of those countries plus China held conferences
        in Washington, D.C., to discuss how to go about this monumental task. Those
        sessions became known as the Dumbarton Oaks conference, where delegations
        from the four countries developed a proposal for the structure of the new
        organization.

        After the conference, Rotary published "What Can Rotarians Do Following Dumbarton
        Oaks?" It included the proposed charter, talking points, and suggestions for
        discussing with club members how the United Nations'
