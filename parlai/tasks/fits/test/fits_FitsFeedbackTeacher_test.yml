      Meet Terrell (TJ)

      I am a 1st generation college graduate and 1st generation post graduate from
      Hampton University and University of Maryland respectively. I have a B.S. and
      M.S. in Electrical Engineering. My academic success is due to my mom''s dedication
      to my education from an early age. My mother also suffers from a mental illness,
      in particularly, schizophrenia.As a result, my childhood and my younger siblings
      were split between my mom and my grandparents.

      My grandparents taught me how to cook. I''ve been cooking since I was 14 years
      old for myself and others. One of my grandfather''s specialties and a favorite
      of my mom''s was cheesecakes.

      In finding the company in 2016, we wanted to create a company that contributed
      funding to alternate treatments of people who suffer mental illness instead
      of institutionalization. These are mothers, fathers, kids, sisters, brothers,
      aunts, uncles, cousins, friends...family. The goal is to find more effective
      ways for people to heal at home with family.

      Honey Truffles

      Peanut Butter Honey Truffles

      Published October 19, 2012 - Last Updated August 13, 2018

      I wanted to share a quick, easy treat before the weekend, and these Peanut Butter
      Honey Truffles seemed like the perfect choice. I make a batch of these little
      snacks every so often and keep them in the fridge. I learned to make them back
      in elementary school at a summer day camp. Once a week, between tie die and
      ceramics class, they would teach us a new recipe. We made easy things like granola
      and trail mix. Of all the recipes we learned, I liked these truffles the best.
      They''re made from simple, natural, unprocessed ingredients- peanut butter,
      oats, honey, and coconut. What could be bad?

      Back in camp we made the truffles with whole oats, but over the years I''ve
      discovered that I like them better when I blend the oats to a powder. They''re
      perfect for when I need a little protein pick-me-up. The honey satisfies my
      sweet tooth, and the peanut butter satiates my hunger. They''re very filling;
      a couple of truffles totally tide me over between meals. They''re also gluten
      free if you use GF certified oats. They''re really easy to make and you can
      get the kids involved- they''ll have fun rolling the truffles with you. It''s
      simple, unprocessed snack food you can feel good about. Shabbat shalom!

      The best honey recipes! Find recipes using honey for main dishes, appetizers,

      August 19th is National Honey Bee Day and I think this is a great reason to
      select and share some of my all-time favorite honey recipes. As you can probably
      guess from the name of this website, I am a big fan of honey. I have talked
      to multiple bee keepers and visited countless hives to learn as much as I can
      about nature''s sweetest bounty and it''s creator.

      I have even let bees crawl all over me - some say I''m crazy for doing this
      but I have learned enough to lose much of my fear of being stung. Don''t swat
      at the bees - they''re just looking for their honey.

      We have yet to become apiary owners ourselves but that doesn''t stop us from
      enjoying all things honey. I have created many honey recipes over the years
      of this blog and I have favorites of course. Below you will find what I believe
      are the best honey recipes!

      Different varieties lend themselves to different uses,  says Test Kitchen Pro
      and Resident Cooking Light Beekepper Adam Hickman. Clover and orange blossom
      are the workhorse honeys. More abundant (and therefore less expensive), they
      have a straightforward flavor that s great for cooking, baking, or sweetening
      iced tea. Harder-to-come-by varietals, like tupelo and sage,  have nuanced flavors
      you don t want to cook out or mask.  These recipes celebrate the pure, sweet
      liquid gold and make brilliant use of honey s delicious, unique character.

      Did you know? Each bee makes about 1/12 of a teaspoon of honey in its life.
      Honey is the sweet nectar of a bee s lifetime work. These healthy honey recipes
      feature several varietals of honey. Consult your local beekeeper for something
      unique and different if you want to break away from classic clover or orange
      blossom honey.

      Because the wings get a good bit of char, the type of honey you use isn t as
      important here (it ll lose its subtler nuances). Though we remove the skin from
      the wings, you d never know it--they pick up an irresistible crispy crunch as
      the glaze cooks under the broiler. Give yourself a better grip when skinning
      each wing by holding it with a paper towel in one hand and pulling the skin
      with another paper towel in the other hand.

      Meet Terrell (TJ)

      I am a 1st generation college graduate and 1st generation post graduate from
      Hampton University and University of Maryland respectively. I have a B.S. and
      M.S. in Electrical Engineering. My academic success is due to my mom''s dedication
      to my education from an early age. My mother also suffers from a mental illness,
      in particularly, schizophrenia.As a result, my childhood and my younger siblings
      were split between my mom and my grandparents.

      My grandparents taught me how to cook. I''ve been cooking since I was 14 years
      old for myself and others. One of my grandfather''s specialties and a favorite
      of my mom''s was cheesecakes.

      In finding the company in 2016, we wanted to create a company that contributed
      funding to alternate treatments of people who suffer mental illness instead
      of institutionalization. These are mothers, fathers, kids, sisters, brothers,
      aunts, uncles, cousins, friends...family. The goal is to find more effective
      ways for people to heal at home with family.

      How can our services help you and your company???

      August 19th is National Honey Bee Day and I think this is a great reason to
      select and share some of my all-time favorite honey recipes. As you can probably
      guess from the name of this website, I am a big fan of honey. I have talked
      to multiple bee keepers and visited countless hives to learn as much as I can
      about nature''s sweetest bounty and it''s creator.

      I have even let bees crawl all over me - some say I''m crazy for doing this
      but I have learned enough to lose much of my fear of being stung. Don''t swat
      at the bees - they''re just looking for their honey.

      We have yet to become apiary owners ourselves but that doesn''t stop us from
      enjoying all things honey. I have created many honey recipes over the years
      of this blog and I have favorites of course. Below you will find what I believe
      are the best honey recipes!

      Different varieties lend themselves to different uses,  says Test Kitchen Pro
      and Resident Cooking Light Beekepper Adam Hickman. Clover and orange blossom
      are the workhorse honeys. More abundant (and therefore less expensive), they
      have a straightforward flavor that s great for cooking, baking, or sweetening
      iced tea. Harder-to-come-by varietals, like tupelo and sage,  have nuanced flavors
      you don t want to cook out or mask.  These recipes celebrate the pure, sweet
      liquid gold and make brilliant use of honey s delicious, unique character.

      Did you know? Each bee makes about 1/12 of a teaspoon of honey in its life.
      Honey is the sweet nectar of a bee s lifetime work. These healthy honey recipes
      feature several varietals of honey. Consult your local beekeeper for something
      unique and different if you want to break away from classic clover or orange
      blossom honey.

      Because the wings get a good bit of char, the type of honey you use isn t as
      important here (it ll lose its subtler nuances). Though we remove the skin from
      the wings, you d never know it--they pick up an irresistible crispy crunch as
      the glaze cooks under the broiler. Give yourself a better grip when skinning
      each wing by holding it with a paper towel in one hand and pulling the skin
      with another paper towel in the other hand.

    - 'Sweet as Honey: Delicious Indian Desserts

      by Malar Gandhi | Oct 8, 2018 | Food, Recipes | 1 comment

      Honey was man''s first sweetener. Honey was also an important condiment in medieval
      times. We crave sweets, as our stone-age forefathers have been deprived of it
      for centuries. Humans (Homo sapiens) evolved some 50,000 years ago, whereas
      bees were making honey 40 million years before that. Honeybees as a group probably
      originated in South East Asia. It seems they developed social behavior and structural
      identity similar to what we observe in modern honey bees, some 30 million years
      ago. Apis mellifera, known as the western honey bee, is a commonly domesticated
      species. It is believed to have originated in Africa and spread later to Europe
      and Asia. Honey was the staple sweetener in Europe till the 1500s. The name
      "honey" comes from the English word "huning." In 1622, European colonists brought
      these sub-species to Americas. Cooking with honey was a mark of privilege and
      it was long used for preserving fruits whole or as a jam.

      Cave paintings in Spain from 7000 B.C show the earliest records of bee keeping.
      Honey is also mentioned in Sumerian and Babylonian cuneiform writings from 2100
      B.C. From available evidence, we know that humans have been collecting honey
      for 10,000 years. But the interplay between bees and flowers is understood much
      later in 1000 A.D.

      The pre-historic cave paintings at Bhimbetka in India show men despoiling beehives
      built on rocks, perhaps around 6000 B.C. Even as early as the Rigvedic period
      (2nd and 1st century)'

      Honey Posset: The Easiest Entertaining Dessert You''ve Never Heard Of

      This honey posset recipe is my go to entertaining dessert because they require
      no special ingredients, can be made ahead and they look so fancy! We won''t
      tell anyone how insanely simple they are.

      Up until about a year ago, I had never heard of a posset before. A sweet friend
      shared her recipe with me as her most made dessert and I was immediately so
      intrigued...just 4 ingredients and no tempering eggs or messing with gelatin?!

      My interest had been thoroughly peaked and I made it that week for a dinner
      party. I now consider this one of my greatest entertaining skill sets too!

      Today I''m sharing with you my favorite version of this dish....lavender honey
      posset. My guests are always a little thrown off by lavender showing up in their
      dessert but as soon as they taste it, all things are right again in the world.

      The flavors here are delicate, creamy, intricate, refreshingly different to
      the palate. The dish is thick and custardy but not in the way an egg custard
      is and nothing like a gelatin based dessert. Its simplicity is a thing of beauty.

      After my mind was blown by this new concept I got curious...why had no one ever
      heard of this? And I had to geek out on the history. Let''s jump in...

      Possets while relatively unheard of in modern history has a long and rich story
      spanning back generations. Shakespeare spoke'
    - 'we react to words in different ways. for instance, "interesting" to some people
      could mean what it was originally meant to be. "interesting" to my mom implies
      unusual, and not in a complementary way.

      in some of my friendships, i filter myself and how i phrase my words more. i
      can be a blunt, possibly even verbally aggressive, person, and there are some
      people who can''t handle that. that''s fine. we''ll just talk about classes
      and whatnot. and then there are the people who can handle my heat, and i''ll
      rant to them about whatever or tell them about insignificant little things in
      my day. probably in caps, perhaps with some autocorrect mistakes ("delirious"
      turned into "delicious" the other day. that was not my point, especially since
      my sentence in relation to finals studying, "we''re all delirious," became,
      "we''re all delicious." ack), sometimes with a vastly different language. that''s
      why i''m not fazed by some things that, for lack of a better phrase, would cause
      others to be like, "AW HELL NO." (somehow my family picked up on this phrase
      and i''m not sure how/why this came to be).

      like anything, we''re shaped by the experiences we''ve had, the people we surround
      ourselves with, the beliefs we live by. so to me, the kind of person who has
      had plenty of sweets in her life but doesn''t like particularly sugar-y things,
      "honeyed" has a cloying, candy corn (this is a disgrace to all candy everywhere,
      make no mistake) ring to it that i don''t like. good thing this'

      Greek Orange Honey Cake with Pistachios

      I''ve been having fun with olive oil cakes, including Italian Apple Olive Oil
      Cake and this Orange Ricotta Cake. But my very favorite currently is this Greek
      orange honey cake!

      This light, flavor-packed honey cake skips all the fuss. And it''s the simple
      cake that will feed a crowd.

      In search for easy desserts that aren''t laden with butter or frosting, I happened
      upon a slightly different version of today''s honey cake in Jamie Oliver''s
      Food Escapes cookbook. An inspiration from the island of Aegina, where pistachios
      and honey from local beekeepers are aplenty! I was immediately hooked!

      This Yiayia-approved honey cake can easily feed a crowd (12 to 15 or so). And
      it''s the kind of simple dessert where you dump all the ingredients in one single
      bowl and mix! But, there is more...

      Why this Honey Cake Works

      There is a lot to love about this honey cake. Top of the list, it''s insanely
      DELICIOUS and very easy to make! But here are a few more things bakers and non-bakers
      alike will appreciate:

      1. The combination of flours, all-purpose flour with coarse semolina (farina),
      gives it such interesting texture.

      2. Greek yogurt here lends a great light and fluffy texture. Plus, its slightly
      tangy flavor balances so well with crave-worthy citrus from the generous amounts
      of orange and lemon zest.

      3. The honey-pistachio SYRUP is king in this recipe! Admittedly, Jamie''s original
      recipe called for less syrup; I found that more of it was need for such a large
      cake.'
