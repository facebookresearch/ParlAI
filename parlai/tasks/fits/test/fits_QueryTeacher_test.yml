      Help me find suggestions.

      That''s a great question. I''m sure there are a lot of great ideas out there.
      What are you looking for?

      I''m looking for something for my spouse. Something personal and memorable for
      our 50th anniversary.

      Traditionally, gold was given for 50th anniversary. Would gold jewelry be something
      your spouse would like?

      I think that would be a great idea. Getting them a gold necklace or ring would
      be a great idea.'

      It depends on the type of soil you have. If you have a well-drained soil, you
      don''t need fertilizer.

      Do you have any recommendations for soil that is not well draining?'
