    - 'Elon Musk s hyperloop dream may come true -- and soon

      It''s happening far faster than I would have ever expected, and it''s happening
      all over the world.

      Hyperloop Transportation Technologies capsule.Hyperloop Transportation Technologies

      Elon Musk first described his idea for a futuristic transportation system that
      would send passenger pods through tubes at speeds of hundreds of miles an hour
      back in 2013. At the time, the idea of actually building and operating a so-called
      "hyperloop" seemed far-fetched, to say the least.

      But hyperloops are no longer quite so hypothetical. A handful of firms are now
      competing to develop the necessary technology. And in addition to designing
      the magnetically levitated pods and testing them on small-scale tracks, the
      firms are taking preliminary steps to set up hyperloop routes in the U.S. and
      abroad.

      "It''s happening far faster than I would have ever expected, and it''s happening
      all over the world," said Dr. David Goldsmith, a transportation researcher at
      Virginia Tech.

      One of the biggest players is Musk himself. His whimsically named Boring Company
      is planning to dig a hyperloop tunnel that would make it possible to travel
      from Washington, D.C. to New York City in half an hour (the fastest Amtrak trains
      make the trip in just under three hours). Meanwhile, a pair of California-based
      startups, Virgin Hyperloop One and Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, are
      developing routes in North America, Asia, and Europe.

      Hyperloop is essentially a train system that Musk calls  a cross between a Concorde,
      a railgun, and an air hockey table . It s based on the very high-speed transit
      (VHST) system proposed in 1972, which combines a magnetic levitation train and
      a low pressure transit tube. It evolves some of the original ideas of VHST,

    - 'Economical, Sustainable, and Insanely Fast

      Hyperloop Outperforms All Other Modes of Transport.

      Linear induction motors, axial compressors, and air bearings enable full-scale
      Hyperloop Pods to sustain speeds upwards of 760 mph inside partially evacuated
      tubes with a fraction of the aerodynamic losses experienced by planes, trains,
      and automobiles. The result is a mass transportation system with faster travel
      times, greater energy efficiency, and lower costs than any previous mode of
      transportation.

      Elon Musk s Hyperloop Alpha, a white paper released in 2013, was the first introduction
      to the Hyperloop concept and an effort to inspire a transportation revolution.
      Connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco at speeds up to 760 mph with total
      construction and operation costs orders of magnitude lower than the California
      High Speed Rail, Hyperloop Alpha readily exceeds traditional transportation
      solutions in both performance and value.

      Five minute station times, top speeds of 760 mph, isolated internal tube environments,
      and a capacity of 840 passengers per hour make the Hyperloop the fastest, safest,
      and most efficient mass transportation system ever proposed.

      With approximately 594 acres of solar cell coverage on top of the tubes, the
      all-electric Hyperloop is completely self powering during peak solar activity,
      ensuring a responsible and reliable transportation solution for the future.

      The LA-SF Hyperloop offers the fastest ground transportation ever proposed at
      a total cost of just $6 billion, where as the California High Speed Rail project
      costs an estimated $68 billion and has a maximum speed of only 220 mph.

    - 'HyperLoopDesign is a resource for Hyperloop engineers, looking at the design
      challenges and solutions for final designs or sub-systems.

      Hyperloop Alpha, August 2013.

      Elon Musk s original proposed Hyperloop Alpha, which runs in a 2.23m (7ft4 )
      diameter tube, at an absolute pressure of 100 Pa ( 1/1000 atmosphere). It used
      air bearing skis, with an air compressor to provide air. Acceleration thrust
      is from linear motors on limited sections of the track.

      Cheetah is a design variation released by Richard Macfarlane in January 2014,
      with a number of changes to simplify and solve problems.

      Wheels are used which provide traction. Steam from the cooling system is ejected
      into the tube, increasing the speed of sound, and reducing aerodynamic drag.

      The pod is 3 seats wide, and the tube is now 2.6 - 2.8m diameter. The seats
      are in 3 seating modules which roll out at the station.

      Maglev and air bearing skis

      Hyperloop Alpha originally proposed air ski bearings for levitation. But there
      may be insufficient airflow in the near-vacuum. See air skis here.

      The tube in the 2016 Pod Competition has an aluminium plate for maglev, but
      any plate maglev will suffer high drag. See passive maglev plate here. See Arx
      Pax here.

      Maglev using copper coils along the whole route would be the ideal levitation
      system, except for the extreme expense. See maglev coils here.

      cars courtesy of Tesla Motors and private spaceflight through his company SpaceX.
      Now Musk envisions cutting the travel time between Los Angeles to San Francisco
      to a mere 35 minutes. He has proposed building a high-speed transportation system
      that would allow humans to travel 760 miles (1,223 kilometers) per hour, or

      Hyperloop One, has been featured in talks to arrive here since 2016, when the
      company first launched its Hyperloop One Global Challenge.

      Toronto-based TransPod, which has developed its own hyperloop prototype that
      would see a network of tubes containing pods travelling at speeds greater than
      1,000 km/hour.

      Hyperloop technology has been debated widely by transportation experts, some
      who see the tube as more of a novel idea than a practical way of getting around.
      There are no hyperloop systems currently operating anywhere in the world.

      According to the TransPod website, a one-way trip on their hyperloop from Toronto
      to Monreal would cost $80, if booked for a same-day trip.'

    - 'Tired of the commute? It might be time to take cars underground

      Like many cities, London has a serious problem with gridlock. According to Eurostat''s
      Urban Europe report, the city has the worst congestion in Europe - an average
      commuter there spends 101 hours in traffic every year.

      An obvious solution to this problem would be to upgrade or expand the existing
      tube, train, and bus networks to be more efficient and far-reaching, so that
      more locals use mass transit.

      But PLP Architecture, a London-based firm, is proposing a more radical idea:
      moving vehicles underground.

      Called the CarTube, the firm''s concept envisions an underground tunnel of automated,
      conveyor belt-like tracks.

      Cars in the tubes would travel a steady speed of 50 mph, so there wouldn''t
      be stop-and-go traffic, PLP''s director of research, Lars Hesselgren, tells
      Business Insider. That would allow the network to cut down commute times by
      up to 75%.

      PLP wouldn''t disclose an estimate for the CarTube''s cost, but said it could
      be built at a fraction of the price of Crossrail, a new high-capacity, 73-mile
      (117 km) railway that''s under construction in London and the southeastern UK.
      That project received PS14.8 billion ($15.7 billion) in funding.

      There are no immediate plans to build the CarTube, but Hesselgren says the firm
      is talking with a number of partners, including Google, about the concept. He
      estimates that if the tube were to be built, construction would take less than
      a decade.

      The CarTube would be a 15.5-mile network of tunnels for automobiles. Hesselgren
      says the system would be located 33 - 98 ft'

      Express Online inexplicably decides to run article claiming F-35 can''t fly

      The Express Online, amazingly, has published an article on their website with
      claims "new F-35 jets still can''t fly", this is embarrassingly incorrect for
      the newspaper as they can indeed fly.

      The cost of the F-35 Block 4 upgrade programme has quadrupled since August,
      according to the latest estimates that emerged during a March the 7th congressional
      hearing in the US. The upcoming block, Block 4, is about incorporating a large
      number of additions and a number of new capabilities. It was always going to
      cost more given that it adds more.

      This upgrade has nothing to do with the original specification covered in Block
      3F which is on-track. The aircraft certainly can fly and they''re flying operationally
      with the United States already, something the Daily Expressed seemed to recognise
      as it removed the article from its website after we objected.

      Siege of Cuddalore - June 1783 / By Richard Simkin, 1890 (Brown University)

      The next time you''re in a trivia contest and the question comes up, "What was
      the last battle of the American Revolutionary War?" the judges will probably
      be looking for the predictable answer of "Yorktown."[1]

      That''s the neat and tidy answer, but it''s not true. After the defeat at Yorktown,
      King George III brushed it off as a minor stumbling block and decreed that the
      war in America should continue. He wrote to the prime minister avowing that
      he would "do what I can to save the Empire."[2] Gen. George Washington, not
      having read twenty-first century schoolbooks, never knew Yorktown would be considered
      the end of the war, or famously as the "last battle of the American Revolutionary
      War." He smartly assumed the British were certainly wounded with Lord Cornwallis''
      surrender, but that they wouldn''t quit. The war would continue. Washington
      felt it was his absolute duty to keep the Continental Army together until there
      was a final peace treaty signed and approved.

      A preliminary treaty finally came on November 30, 1782, a year after Yorktown...
      but there was still no formal treaty. Washington remembered what Ben Franklin
      had said, "The British Nation seems... unable to carry on the War and too proud
      to make peace."[3] The politicians were all still talking in Paris. Washington
      instinctively didn''t trust the British and knew it could be a mistake to lower
      his guard of them, even while talks were going'

      Battle of Long Island, also known as the Battle of Brooklyn or the Battle of
      Brooklyn Heights, (August 27-29, 1776), in the American Revolution, successful
      British action in Brooklyn, New York, against the American Continental Army
      and the first major battle of the war since the American declaration of independence

    - 'Beer was in America long before the first Europeans got lost on their way to
      India. Native Americans made it from maize, birch sap and water. A recipe they
      would share with the Pilgrims who landed at Plymouth Rock.

      The Pilgrims and Beer

      If the Mayflower had been carrying more beer, it might never have landed at
      Plymouth Rock.

      When the Pilgrims sailed for America, they hoped to find a place to settle where
      the farmland would be rich and the climate congenial. Instead, they found themselves
      struggling with the stony soil and harsh winters of New England - all due to
      a shortage of beer.

      An entry in the diary of a Mayflower passenger explains the unplanned landing
      at Plymouth Rock: "We could not now take time for further search... our victuals
      being much spent, especially our beer..."

      That may have been the last time America''s settlers ran short of beer. They
      soon learned from their Indian neighbors how to make beer from maize. Local
      breweries sprouted up throughout the colonies, and experienced brewmasters were
      eagerly recruited from London. By 1770, the American brewing industry was so
      well established that George Washington, Patrick Henry and other patriots argued
      for a boycott of English beer imports. The Boston Tea Party almost became the
      Boston Beer Party.

      William Penn wrote that the beer in his colony was made of "Molasses... well
      boyled, with Sassafras or Pine infused into it." The taste of such a concoction
      must have been interesting, especially from the popular drinking vessel of the

    - 'The Meiji Restoration and Modernization

      In 1868 the Tokugawa shogun ( great general ), who ruled Japan in the feudal
      period, lost his power and the emperor was restored to the supreme position.
      The emperor took the name Meiji ( enlightened rule ) as his reign name; this
      event was known as the Meiji Restoration.

      The Reign of the Meiji Emperor

      When the Meiji emperor was restored as head of Japan in 1868, the nation was
      a militarily weak country, was primarily agricultural, and had little technological
      development. It was controlled by hundreds of semi-independent feudal lords.
      The Western powers -- Europe and the United States -- had forced Japan to sign
      treaties that limited its control over its own foreign trade and required that
      crimes concerning foreigners in Japan be tried not in Japanese but in Western
      courts. When the Meiji period ended, with the death of the emperor in 1912,
      Japan had

      * a highly centralized, bureaucratic government;

      * a constitution establishing an elected parliament;

      * a well-developed transport and communication system;

      * a highly educated population free of feudal class restrictions;

      * an established and rapidly growing industrial sector based on the latest technology;
      and

      * a powerful army and navy.

      Japan had regained complete control of its foreign trade and legal system, and,
      by fighting and winning two wars (one of them against a major European power,
      Russia), it had established full independence and equality in international
      affairs. In a little more than a generation, Japan had exceeded its goals, and
      in the process had changed its whole society. Japan s success'
    - 'Why did African Americans join the British Army during the American Revolution?

      A Black Loyalist in John Singleton Copley s Death of Major Pierson (1782)

      During the nineteenth century, freed enslaved Africans in the North designated
      March 5th a holiday to commemorate the sacrifice of Crispus Attucks. Attucks,
      who worked as a sailor, had been the first person killed in the long conflict
      over the question of colonial independence during what has become known as the
      Boston Massacre in 1770. In the North, among abolitionists his life demonstrated
      how intertwined Black lives were with the founding of the American republic.
      They added evidence of Attucks''s sacrifice as well as the sacrifice of many
      more free and enslaved African patriots to the ledger of proof of African America''s
      loyalty and as a rationale for the ending of the system of enslavement. [1]

      Military service has been traditionally offered as a demonstration of both patriotism
      and the obligation to return such favors with the benefits of citizenship. Although
      the abolitionists were right to affirm the sacrifices of a veritable segment
      of the African American community, more people of African descent actually fought
      on the side of the British army. It is likely for this reason that many of the
      subsequent episodes of enslaved people''s repression came to fruition. Unlike
      other "Loyalists," a sizable segment of those who fought for the British, and
      most importantly their descendants, remained to incur the wrath of the victorious
      American rebels.
