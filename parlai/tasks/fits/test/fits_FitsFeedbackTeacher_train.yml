      The Wars of the Roses were a series of bloody civil wars for the throne of England
      between two competing royal families: the House of York and the House of Lancaster,
      both members of the age-old royal Plantagenet family. Waged between 1455 and
      1485, the Wars of the Roses earned its flowery name because the white rose was
      the badge of the Yorks, and the red rose was the badge of the Lancastrians.
      After 30 years of political manipulation, horrific carnage and brief periods
      of peace, the wars ended and a new royal dynasty emerged.

      In 1422, Henry VI succeeded his father Henry V and became King of England--at
      just nine months old.

      Thanks to his father''s military conquests, Henry VI also became the disputed
      King of France. In 1445, Henry VI married Margaret of Anjou, a noble and strong-willed
      Frenchwoman whose ambition and political savvy overshadowed her husband''s.

      All was not well in King Henry''s court. He had little interest in politics
      and was a weak ruler. This incited rampant lawlessness throughout his realm
      and opened the door for power-hungry nobles and kingmakers to plot behind his
      back.

      Henry''s lack of leadership led him to lose almost all his holdings in France.
      This and the corruption and mismanagement of power in England, not to mention
      heavy taxation, caused frustrated property owners and peasants from Kent to
      revolt in 1450.

      Divorce lawyer Danny De Vito warns his prospective client that the story he
      s about to tell isn t a pretty one, but the client listens with eager intensity
      -- as do the folks out there in the movie in the audience. The War of the Roses
      can best be described as a slapstick tragedy concerning the decline and literal
      fall of a marriage. After 17 years, Oliver (Michael Douglas) and Barbara (Kathleen
      Turner) Rose want a divorce. Not for this couple is there anything resembling
      a  civilized understanding : Barbara wants their opulent house, and Oliver isn
      t about to part with the domicile. Barbara nails the basement door shut while
      Oliver is downstairs, Oliver disrupts Barbara s fancy party by taking aim at
      the catered dinner, Barbara lays waste to Oliver s sports car....and so it goes,

    - '9 Things You Should Know About the Wars of the Roses

      Explore nine key facts about the bloody feud that permanently altered the course
      of British history.

      1. The Yorks and Lancasters were descended from the same family.

      The Houses of York and Lancaster both traced their lineage to the sons of Edward
      III of the House of Plantagenet, who ruled as England''s king from 1327 until
      1377. The Yorks were descended from the female relatives of Edward''s second
      and fourth sons, while the Lancasters were related to Edward''s third son, John
      of Gaunt. This complicated family tree ensured that both factions had a legitimate
      case for their royal lineage, though by modern standards the Yorkists'' claim
      was undoubtedly stronger. Nevertheless, when the Wars of the Roses first kicked
      off, the Lancasters had been entrenched on the throne since 1399, when Henry
      IV usurped power from his cousin Richard II.

      2. Fallout from the Hundred Years'' War helped spark the unrest.

      The Wars of the Roses might never have happened if not for the tenuous state
      of English politics in the 1450s. The realm was still reeling from its recent
      defeat in the last phase of the Hundred Years'' War with France, which had drained
      royal coffers, fractured the nobility and sent legions of unemployed soldiers
      flooding into the countryside. The sorry state of affairs was compounded by
      the weak and witless reign of the Lancasterian King Henry VI, who suffered from
      a mental illness that often rendered him nearly catatonic. Richard, Duke of
      York was made protector of the realm'

    - 'The Wars of the Roses was the name given to a series of civil wars that were
      fought between the House of Lancaster and the House of York between 1455 and
      1485. The name ''Wars of the Roses'' was given because of the badges used by
      the two opposing groups. The Lancastrians brandished a red rose while the Yorkists
      were represented by a white rose.

      The civil conflict came just two years after the Hundred Years War; however
      the civil wars were the product of a number of negative scenarios which led

      This timeline will take a look at some of the event s and battles that occurred
      during the Wars of the Roses.

      During the reign of Lancastrian King Henry VI (1422 - 1461) the first War of
      the Roses battle took place, known as The First Battle of St.Albans on May 22,
      1455. This marks the start of what will be a bloody civil war for England. The
      battle was a victory for the Yorkist army.

      Battles continue to be fought throughout England at a variety of locations over
      the next few years. These battles include:

      Blore Heath (1459 - Yorkist victory)

      Ludford Bridge (1459 - Lancastrian victory)

      A number of events occurred during 1460. The Lancastrian King Henry VI had a
      number of battles against the Yorkist forces, which were being led by the Duke

      Princes in the Tower

      The Wars of the Roses were a series of bloody civil wars for the throne of England
      between two competing royal families: the House of York and the House of Lancaster,
      both members of the age-old royal Plantagenet family. Waged between 1455 and
      1485, the Wars of the Roses earned its flowery name because the white rose was
      the badge of the Yorks, and the red rose was the badge of the Lancastrians.
      After 30 years of political manipulation, horrific carnage and brief periods
      of peace, the wars ended and a new royal dynasty emerged.

      In 1422, Henry VI succeeded his father Henry V and became King of England--at
      just nine months old.

      Thanks to his father''s military conquests, Henry VI also became the disputed
      King of France. In 1445, Henry VI married Margaret of Anjou, a noble and strong-willed
      Frenchwoman whose ambition and political savvy overshadowed her husband''s.

      All was not well in King Henry''s court. He had little interest in politics
      and was a weak ruler. This incited rampant lawlessness throughout his realm
      and opened the door for power-hungry nobles and kingmakers to plot behind his
      back.

      Henry''s lack of leadership led him to lose almost all his holdings in France.
      This and the corruption and mismanagement of power in England, not to mention
      heavy taxation, caused frustrated property owners and peasants from Kent to
      revolt in 1450.

      Fought between the houses of Lancaster and York for the English throne, the
      wars were named many years afterward from the supposed badges of the contending

      Both houses claimed the throne through descent from the sons of Edward III.
      Since the Lancastrians had occupied the throne from 1399, the Yorkists might
      never have pressed a claim but for the near anarchy prevailing in the mid-15th
      century. After the death of Henry V in 1422 the country was subject to the long
      and factious minority of Henry VI (August 1422-November 1437), during which
      the English kingdom was managed by the king''s council, a predominantly aristocratic
      body. That arrangement, which probably did not accord with Henry V''s last wishes,
      was not maintained without difficulty. Like Richard II before him, Henry VI
      had powerful relatives eager to grasp after power and to place themselves at
      the head of factions in the state. The council soon became their battleground.

      Great magnates'
    - 'The Plantaganet King Henry VI was a weak king, married to an ambitious French
      princess, Margaret of Anjou. At this time, there was a complex series of rivalries
      and jealousies at court between powerful noble families. The Queen and her circle
      of nobles were known as Lancastrians after Henry''s surname of Lancaster. The
      party of nobles who opposed the Queen and the Lancastrians was led by Richard,
      Duke of York, Henry''s cousin, who was also descended from King Edward III and
      therefore also had a claim to the throne of England. They were known as Yorkists.

      Henry VI suffered from periods of insanity. During one of these periods in 1454,
      Richard of York was appointed ''Protector of the Realm''. His first act was
      to dismiss some of the Queen''s Lancastrian advisors which caused great bad
      feeling. The King recovered some months later and York was summarily dismissed.

      The weak, sick king was unable to control his ambitious queen on one side, and
      the Yorkist Earl of Warwick, the ''kingmaker'', on the other side.

      Both sides started to recruit soldiers and prepare for war. Many soldiers had
      just returned from the Hundred Years War in France, so recruiting trained men
      to fight was easy. Each side chose a badge: the Red Rose for Lancaster and the
      White Rose for York.

      In 1455, just two years after the end of the Hundred Years War, this dynastic
      civil war broke out. There was tremendous bloodshed as defeated forces on both
      sides were brutally murdered by the victors.

    - 'The Wars of the Roses were the civil wars fought in England and Wales between
      the Yorkist and Lancastrian dynasties between 1455 and 1485. Though historians
      can''t agree on precisely when and where the conflicts concluded, the general
      consensus is that the Wars of the Roses ended with the battle of Bosworth in
      1485, when Henry Tudor (the future Henry VII, the first Tudor king) defeated
      and killed Richard III...

      But, argues historian Matthew Lewis, the roots of these dynastic civil wars
      went deeper and the branches reached further than this 30-year timeframe suggests.
      Here, writing for History Extra, Lewis shares 12 lesser-known facts about the
      Wars of the Roses...

      Jack Cade''s rebellion rocked the Lancastrians

      In July 1450, a mysterious man known as Jack Cade led a huge force of common
      men from Kent into London to protest against the ailing government of the Lancastrian
      king Henry VI. This episode is generally regarded as being outside the bounds
      of the Wars of the Roses, but those edges are blurred and elastic.

      When Jack Cade entered the capital he struck the London Stone, which can still
      be seen on Cannon Street, and, according to Shakespeare, proclaimed: "Now is
      Mortimer lord of this city!" After this, Cade openly adopted the provocative
      name John Mortimer. The Mortimer line was considered by many to be senior to
      the Lancastrian line, since the Mortimers were heirs apparent to Richard II
      - so adding weight to the later Yorkist claim to the throne.

      civil war broke out. There was tremendous bloodshed as defeated forces on both
      sides were brutally murdered by the victors.

      A Chronology of the Wars of the'
    - 'The Wars of the Roses were a series of bloody battles for the throne of England
      that took place between 1455 and 1487. Fought between the rival Plantagenet
      houses of Lancaster and York, the wars are notorious for their many moments
      of treachery and for the sheer amount of blood they spilled on English soil.

      The wars ended when Richard III, the last Yorkist king, was defeated at the
      Battle of Bosworth in 1485 by Henry Tudor - founder of the house of Tudor.

      Here are 30 facts about the Wars:

      1. The seeds of war were sewn as far back as 1399

      That year Richard II was deposed by his cousin, Henry Bolingbroke who would
      go on to be the Henry IV. This created two competing lines of the Plantagenet
      family, both of which thought they had the rightful claim.

      On the one side there were the descendants of Henry IV - known as the Lancastrians
      - and on the other the heirs of Richard II. In the 1450s, the leader of this
      family was Richard of York; his followers would come to be known as the Yorkists.

      2. When Henry VI came to power he was in an incredible position...

      Thanks to the military successes of his father, Henry V, Henry VI held vast
      swathes of France and was the only King of England to be crowned King of France
      and England.

      3. ...but his foreign policy soon proved disastrous

      Over the course of his reign Henry gradually lost almost all England''s possessions
      in France.

      It culminated in the disastrous defeat at Castillon in'
    - 'In the opening battle of England''s War of the Roses, the Yorkists defeat King
      Henry VI''s Lancastrian forces at St. Albans, 20 miles northwest of London.
      Many Lancastrian nobles perished, including Edmund Beaufort, the duke of Somerset,
      and the king was forced to submit to the rule of his cousin, Richard of York.
      The dynastic struggle between the House of York, whose badge was a white rose,
      and the House of Lancaster, later associated with a red rose, would stretch
      on for 30 years.

      Both families, closely related, claimed the throne through descent from the
      sons of Edward III, the king of England from 1327 to 1377. The first Lancastrian
      king was Henry IV in 1399, and rebellion and lawlessness were rife during his
      reign. His son, Henry V, was more successful and won major victories in the
      Hundred Years War against France. His son and successor, Henry VI, had few kingly
      qualities and lost most of the French land his father had conquered. At home,
      chaos prevailed and lords with private armies challenged Henry VI''s authority.
      At times, his ambitious queen, Margaret of Anjou, effectively controlled the
      crown.

      In 1453, Henry lapsed into insanity, and in 1454 Parliament appointed Richard,
      duke of York, as protector of the realm. Henry and York''s grandfathers were
      the fourth and third sons of Edward III, respectively. When Henry recovered
      in late 1454, he dismissed York and restored the authority of Margaret, who
      saw York as a threat to the succession of their son, Prince Edward. York raised
      an army of 3,000'
