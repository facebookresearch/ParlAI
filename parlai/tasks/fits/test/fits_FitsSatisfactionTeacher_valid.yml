      Ballet costumes constitute an essential part of stage design and can be considered
      as a visual record of a performance. They are often the only survival of a production,
      representing a living imaginary picture of the scene.

      Prima ballerina Anna Pavlova. Early ballerina skirts were heavy, voluminous
      affairs that severely restricted the dancer s movements. Fortunately, by the
      early twentieth century, skirts were raised to the knees to showcase pointe
      work.

      The origins of ballet lie in the court spectacles of the Renaissance in France
      and Italy, and evidence of costumes specifically for ballet can be dated to
      the early fifteenth century. Illustrations from this period show the importance
      of masks and clothing for spectacles. Splendor at court was strongly reflected
      in luxuriously designed ballet costumes. Cotton and silk were mixed with flax
      woven into semitransparent gauze.

      From the beginning of the sixteenth century, public theaters were being built
      in Venice (1637), Rome (1652), Paris (1660), Hamburg

      (1678), and other important cities. Ballet spectacles were combined in these
      venues with processional festivities and masquerades, as stage costumes became
      highly decorated and made from expensive materials. The basic costume for a
      male dancer was a tight-fitting, often brocaded cuirass, a short draped skirt
      and feather-decorated helmets. Female dancers wore opulently embroidered silk

    - 'Ballet costume, clothing designed to allow dancers freedom of movement while
      at the same time enhancing the visual effect of dance movements--for example,
      the ballerina''s tutu, a multilayered skirt that creates an impression of lightness
      and flight.

      In the earliest ballets of the 17th century, dancers traditionally wore heeled
      shoes. Men wore the costume a la Romaine, or tonnelet, a stiff, wired skirt
      of brocade or similar material, resembling in shape the modern tutu. Women wore
      heavy costumes reminiscent of court dress, with elaborate trains, and wigs and
      jewels. Male and sometimes female dancers wore leather masks, comic or tragic
      in appearance, that represented the character portrayed and concealed all facial
      expression. In the early 18th century the dancer Marie Camargo shortened her
      skirts to midcalf length, invented heelless dance slippers, and wore close-fitting
      drawers to facilitate and exhibit her mastery of intricate dance steps. Also
      in the early 18th century, Marie Salle danced in a simple muslin robe, with
      her hair loose and flowing, and abandoned the leather mask; she thus anticipated
      the reforms of Jean-Georges Noverre, who, some 25 years later, succeeded in
      eliminating the mask and harmonizing every detail of costume with the whole
      production.

      By the late 18th century, ballet costume had undergone sweeping reforms. The
      panniers (overskirts draped over an existing skirt to add volume) and hoop skirts
      abhorred by Noverre were finally discarded in favour of clinging tunics inspired

    - 'What Is a Miners Cut Diamond

      By Adrienne Warber Jewelry Designer

      Learn more diamond facts.

      What is a miners cut diamond? A miners cut is a type of diamond cut common in
      antique jewelry dating back to the 1830s. Many Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian
      style engagement rings feature this type of cut because it was a popular 19th
      century jewelry design. The original old mine cut diamonds have a rich history
      that reflects the history of the diamond jewelry trade.

      What Is a Miners Cut Diamond?

      Diamond structure is comprised of five parts:

      Table - The top of the diamond and the largest facet

      Crown - The upper section of the diamond between the girdle and the table

      Girdle - The area between the crown and pavilion, which is generally thicker
      in antique diamond cuts than in modern cuts

      Pavilion - The bottom section of the diamond and the deepest part of the diamond
      in antique cuts

      Culet aka cutlet - The small facet at the bottom end of the diamond

      The miner cut diamond is shaped into a high crown with a small table, a round
      to somewhat rectangular girdle, a deep pavilion and a large faceted culet. The
      cut was the earliest form of the brilliant cut, which means that the diamond
      was cut to allow the stone to sparkle under even the dimmest candlelight of
      the era.

      The diamond cut is also known by the following names:

      Old mine cut (original name)

      Old miner cut

      Triple brilliant cut

      Peruzzi cut

      The miner cut resembles both the modern cushion cut. In fact, some jewelry experts

      How to Dress Up for a Disco Party

      In this Article:For WomenFor MenCommunity Q&AReferences

      Disco fashion had a style all its own. Everyday clothing in the 1970s would
      not work for a festive night at a disco club. Instead, men and women both wore
      gaudy materials and daring styles. If attending a disco party, look the part
      by throwing on flared clothing that reflects light well.

      Women''s disco fashion included both short, revealing clothes and long outfits
      that covered nearly everything. Choose the style you feel most comfortable with.

      Select the right fabrics. Disco clothing was made of stretchy, shiny material
      that readily reflected the bright lights of a disco club. Look for spandex,
      lycra, velour, and synthetic polyester. Also consider pieces heavily adorned
      in sparkly sequins or gold lame.

      Try on a mini-skirt or mini-dress. Midi-skirts, which came up to the mid-calf,
      were also popular in the 1970s. Look for a design that flares out slightly starting
      at the waist. The skirt can have pleats, but does not need them. If you decide
      to go with a mini-dress, look for one with a halter style top.

      Look for a 1970''s style catsuit. The catsuit was a type of one-piece bodysuit
      often made of spandex. Typically, the legs were fitted at the thigh and flared
      out at the knee. The suit could have sleeves that flared out, starting at the
      elbow, or it could be sleeveless. Many catsuits also featured a halter top or
      deep v-neck.

      Wear hot pants. Hot pants in the 1970s were daringly short pants that covered
      the rear,'

      Use the check register. You know that extra little notebook that comes with
      your checks, and slips right into your checkbook? It s designed to help you
      keep track of your all your income and expenditures and all your transactions,
      from deposits, ATM withdrawals, debit card usage, fees, to any checks you write.[1]

      If you do not have a check register, you can buy or make one. A ledger, graph
      paper, or even a blank sheet of lined paper will do.

      Find out your current balance. Log on to your account online, call or visit
      your bank, or visit an ATM and get the current balance on the account you wish
      to track.[2]

      Do you want to know exactly how much you have available to spend from your bank
      account? Would you like to catch errors (including bank errors and mistakes
      you''ve made) before they cause major problems? Balancing your bank account
      helps you keep track of everything in your account, and it''s a relatively easy
      task to complete.

      In the past, you''d balance your checkbook on paper. There''s nothing wrong
      with continuing to do it that way, but you might prefer additional options.
      So, if you''re looking for a tool to help you keep track of things, several
      of them are listed below. After you get your tool of choice, we''ll discuss
      how and why to balance your account.

      Balancing on paper: If you like to use a pencil and paper, check the back of
      your bank statements--there''s probably a template printed there. You can also
      download and print a PDF form.

      Excel spreadsheets: For Microsoft Office users, there''s a simple Excel spreadsheet
      template and more robust versions that track your spending categories for you.

      Google Sheets: To track everything in your Google account, use the classic checkbook
      version or just go with the simplest possible design.

      Open Office: Open source fans also have an excellent template available.

      No matter which format you use, you should be able to accomplish two critical
      tasks:

      Do you know how to balance a checkbook?

      One of the first money lessons my Dad taught me was how to balance my checkbook
      (i.e. check register).

      This is definitely one of those skills everyone should have, regardless of the
      fact that many of us don t write more than one check each month.

      When you balance a checkbook, what you are doing is reconciling the balance
      that you have in your checkbook with the bank s balance. If your latest statement
      with the bank says that you have $1,000 in your account, and your running checkbook
      says that you have $1,100, then you need to reconcile the two amounts and determine
      what s causing the difference.

      Balancing your checkbook helps you achieve three goals: identify the bank s
      errors, identify your errors (more likely), and it tells you your true balance
      so that you don t write a check for more than you have in your account.

      Today, however, we can understand our money situation in easier ways: by logging
      on to our bank s online account access page, or by viewing our bank s mobile
      phone app, or seeing all of our accounts at one time using a service like Personal
      Capital (review link). Since we don t write as'
    - 'Check register balance

      =balance-debit+credit

      To set a check register formula that calculates a running balance, you can use
      a formula based on simple addition and subtraction.

      =G5-E6+F6

      The value in G5 is hard-coded. The formula picks up the value in G5, then subtracts
      the value (if any) in E6 and adds the value (if any) in F6. When the credit
      or debit values are empty, they behave like zero and have no effect on the result.

      When this formula is copied down column G, it will continue to calculate a running
      balance in each row.

      Dealing with blank values

      To display nothing in the balance column when the credit and debit columns are
      empty, you can use the IF function with AND and ISBLANK like this:

      =IF(AND(ISBLANK(E6),ISBLANK(F6)),  ,G5-E6+F6)

      This formula will return an empty string (  ) when both credit and debit cells
      are empty, and return the running balance if either number exists.

      Note: this only handles bank credit and debit values at the end of the table,
      not rows in between.

      Excel IF Function

      The AND function is a logical function used to require more than one condition
      at the same time. AND returns either TRUE or FALSE. To test if a number in A1
      is greater than zero and less than 10, use =AND(A1>0,A1...

      The Excel ISBLANK function returns TRUE when a cell contains is empty, and FALSE
      when a cell is not empty. For example, if A1 contains  apple , ISBLANK(A1) returns
      FALSE.

          Do you know how to balance a checkbook?

          One of the first money lessons my Dad taught me was how to balance my checkbook
          (i.e. check register).

          This is definitely one of those skills everyone should have, regardless
          of the fact that many of us don t write more than one check each month.

          When you balance a checkbook, what you are doing is reconciling the balance
          that you have in your checkbook with the bank s balance. If your latest
          statement with the bank says that you have $1,000 in your account, and your
          running checkbook says that you have $1,100, then you need to reconcile
          the two amounts and determine what s causing the difference.

          Balancing your checkbook helps you achieve three goals: identify the bank
          s errors, identify your errors (more likely), and it tells you your true
          balance so that you don t write a check for more than you have in your account.

          Today, however, we can understand our money situation in easier ways: by
          logging on to our bank s online account access page, or by viewing our bank
          s mobile phone app, or seeing all of our accounts at one time using a service

        Balancing your checkbook is one of those crucial life skills that you need
        to know. It will give you a clear sense of not only how much money is in your
        bank account, but where your money goes. It can also help prevent you from
        bouncing checks, stick to your budget, help you avoid fees, and detect errors
        from your bank or even fraudulent billing.

        Recording Your Income and Transactions

        Use the check register. You know that extra little notebook that comes with
        your checks, and slips right into your checkbook? It s designed to help you
        keep track of your all your income and expenditures and all your transactions,
        from deposits, ATM withdrawals, debit card usage, fees, to any checks you
        write.[1]

        If you do not have a check register, you can buy or make one. A ledger, graph
        paper, or even a blank sheet of lined paper will do.

        Find out your current balance. Log on to your account online, call or visit
        your bank, or visit an ATM and get the current balance on the account you
        wish to track.[2]

        Write this balance in the box at the top of the page or on the empty first

        =balance-debit+credit

        To set a check register formula that calculates a running balance, you can
        use a formula based on simple addition and subtraction.

        =G5-E6+F6

        The value in G5 is hard-coded. The formula picks up the value in G5, then
        subtracts the value (if any) in E6 and adds the value (if any) in F6. When
        the credit or debit values are empty, they behave like zero and have no effect
        on the result.

        When this formula is copied down column G, it will continue to calculate a
        running balance in each row.

        Dealing with blank values

        To display nothing in the balance column when the credit and debit columns
        are empty, you can use the IF function with AND and ISBLANK like this:

        =IF(AND(ISBLANK(E6),ISBLANK(F6)),  ,G5-E6+F6)

        This formula will return an empty string (  ) when both credit and debit cells
        are empty, and return the running balance if either number exists.

        Note: this only handles bank credit and debit values at the end of the table,
        not rows in between.

        Excel IF Function

        The AND function is a logical function used to require more than one condition
        at the same time. AND returns either TRUE or FALSE. To test if a number in
        A1 is greater than zero and less than 10, use =AND(A1>0,A1...

        The Excel ISBLANK function returns TRUE when a cell contains is empty, and
        FALSE when a cell is not empty. For example, if A1 contains  apple , ISBLANK(A1)
        returns FALSE.

        Balancing your checkbook is one of those crucial life skills that you need
        to know. It will give you a clear sense of not only how much money is in your
        bank account, but where your money goes. It can also help prevent you from
        bouncing checks, stick to your budget, help you avoid fees, and detect errors
        from your bank or even fraudulent billing.

        Sample Checkbook Register

        Recording Your Income and Transactions

        Use the check register. You know that extra little notebook that comes with
        your checks, and slips right into your checkbook? It s designed to help you
        keep track of your all your income and expenditures and all your transactions,
        from deposits, ATM withdrawals, debit card usage, fees, to any checks you
        write.[1]

        If you do not have a check register, you can buy or make one. A ledger, graph
        paper, or even a blank sheet of lined paper will do.

        Find out your current balance. Log on to your account online, call or visit
        your bank, or visit an ATM and get the current balance on the account you
        wish to track.[2]

        Write this balance in the box at the top of the page or on the empty first
        line with the note  balance forward .

        Do you want to know exactly how much you have available to spend from your
        bank account? Would you like to catch errors (including bank errors and mistakes
        you''ve made) before they cause major problems? Balancing your bank account
        helps you keep track of everything in your account, and it''s a relatively
        easy task to complete.

        In the past, you''d balance your checkbook on paper. There''s nothing wrong
        with continuing to do it that way, but you might prefer additional options.
        So, if you''re looking for a tool to help you keep track of things, several
        of them are listed below. After you get your tool of choice, we''ll discuss
        how and why to balance your account.

        Balancing on paper: If you like to use a pencil and paper, check the back
        of your bank statements--there''s probably a template printed there. You can
        also download and print a PDF form.

        Excel spreadsheets: For Microsoft Office users, there''s a simple Excel spreadsheet
        template and more robust versions that track your spending categories for
        you.

        Google Sheets: To track everything in your Google account, use the classic
        checkbook version or just go with the simplest possible design.

        Open Office: Open source fans also have an excellent template available.

        No matter which format you use, you should be able to accomplish two critical

        One of the first money lessons my Dad taught me was how to balance my checkbook
        (i.e. check register).

        This is definitely one of those skills everyone should have, regardless of

        When you balance a checkbook, what you are doing is reconciling the balance

        =balance-debit+credit

        To set a check register formula that calculates a running balance, you can
        use a formula based on simple addition and subtraction.

        =G5-E6+F6

        The value in G5 is hard-coded. The formula picks up the value in G5, then
        subtracts the value (if any) in E6 and adds the value (if any) in F6. When
        the credit or debit values are empty, they behave like zero and have no effect
        on the result.

        When this formula is copied down column G, it will continue to calculate a
        running balance in each row.

        Dealing with blank values

        To display nothing in the balance column when the credit and debit columns
        are empty, you can use the IF function with AND and ISBLANK like this:

        =IF(AND(ISBLANK(E6),ISBLANK(F6)),  ,G5-E6+F6)

        This formula will return an empty string (  ) when both credit and debit cells
        are empty, and return the running balance if either number exists.

        Note: this only handles bank credit and debit values at the end of the table,
        not rows in between.

        Excel IF Function

        The AND function is a logical function used to require more than one condition
        at the same time. AND returns either TRUE or FALSE. To test if a number in
        A1 is greater than zero and less than 10, use =AND(A1>0,A1...

        The Excel ISBLANK function returns TRUE when a cell contains is empty, and
        FALSE when a cell is not empty. For example, if A1 contains  apple , ISBLANK(A1)
        returns FALSE.

      Installing carpet is a job you can do yourself and save money. Just be prepared
      to take your time, and make sure you have the right tools, which you can rent
      at your local Home Depot Tool Rental Center.

      This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to install carpet using
      tack strips, which are thin, narrow pieces of wood with sharp tacks protruding
      through them to hold the carpeting in place.

      Select the right padding for your carpet. A better quality pad offers a more
      comfortable surface, longer carpet life, and better sound and energy insulation.

      Renting a knee kicker and carpet stretcher is often much more economical than
      buying one.

      Use caution when using the knee kicker. Don t be overly aggressive. Hit it with
      the part of your leg just above the knee.

      If your room is wider than 15 feet, it will require a seam. No seam is invisible
      and looped carpets show seams more than others, but a good job is less visible
      than a bad one.

      Installing your own wall to wall carpet isn t a job everybody wants to take
      on. It can be hard on both your knees and your back, and if you don t get it
      right, everybody can see where you messed up. However, installing carpet isn
      t  rocket science,  and by using some specialized tools (available at most tool
      rental outlets) and being prepared to take your time, installing carpet is a
      job you can do yourself.

      Your first step is to get rid of the old carpet. Start by removing the moldings
      around the floor and take the door off the entrance, so you can get the old
      carpet out and the new carpet in easier. Give the old carpet a good vacuuming
      so you won t be breathing in dust, and then use a utility knife to cut the carpet
      into strips about 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) wide (most cities require that
      for pick up)

      Start at one end and pull the carpet off the tackless strips and roll it up
      in sections. Some people feel that you can reuse the existing underlay, but
      in most cases it will be worn out just like the carpet, so you re better off
      getting rid of it as well.

      Before you get started installing your carpet, you first need to determine the
      look you want in your home. There are two ways of installing carpet on stairs:
      the Hollywood method and the waterfall method.

      * The Hollywood method tightly wraps the carpet over the edge the tread and
      around the nosing (or the front edge) of each step, then fastens it down on
      the riser for a clean and contoured appearance. Its tailored look makes this
      a popular choice for the most visible stairways in the home, such as those leading
      up from the living room or foyer.

      If you want to change the interior decor of a room or want to add carpet to
      a section of your house, laying down carpet tiles is a simple and easy solution.
      You can install carpet tiles over linoleum, hardwood, or concrete floors. To
      install carpet tiles, you''ll need to design the carpet layout, make sure the
      tiles fit, then cut and adhere them to the floor. If you use the right materials
      and follow the right steps, you can install carpet tile in virtually any space
      in your house!

      Designing Your Floor

      Choose a style of carpet tile. Carpet tiles come in a variety of designs and
      types. Find a tile that will compliment the colors of your room. Also, there
      are traditionally two types of tile--those that come with a peel-off adhesive
      on the back and those that have no adhesive. The peel-off adhesive style is
      typically more expensive.[1]

      If you purchase the tile with no adhesive, you may also have to buy carpet glue
      or double-sided carpet tape.

      Select a carpet tile that blends in with the room''s style and colors, rather
      than a tile that stands out.

      Measure the square footage of the floor that you want to cover. To get the area
      of your floor, multiply the width by the length of the floor. If you have an
      irregularly sized floor, divide the floor into separate, measurable sections,
      then add the total square feet of each section together.'

      Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know
      of so far that''s inhabited by living things. While Earth is only the fifth
      largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system
      with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth
      is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made
      of rock and metal.

      The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth,
      were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth
      is a Germanic word, which simply means "the ground."

      Size and Distance

      With a radius of 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the
      terrestrial planets, and the fifth largest planet overall.

      From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth
      is exactly one astronomical unit away from the Sun because one astronomical
      unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. This unit provides
      an easy way to quickly compare planets  distances from the Sun.

      It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.

      As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours. It takes
      365.25 days to complete one trip around the Sun. That extra quarter of a day
      presents a challenge to our calendar system, which counts one year as 365 days.

    - 'By Holli Riebeek Design by Robert Simmon June 3, 2010

      Throughout its long history, Earth has warmed and cooled time and again. Climate
      has changed when the planet received more or less sunlight due to subtle shifts
      in its orbit, as the atmosphere or surface changed, or when the Sun''s energy
      varied. But in the past century, another force has started to influence Earth''s
      climate: humanity.

      (NASA astronaut photograph ISS022-E-6674.)

      Global warming is the unusually rapid increase in Earth''s average surface temperature
      over the past century primarily due to the greenhouse gases released by people
      burning fossil fuels.

      How Does Today''s Warming Compare to Past Climate Change?

      Earth has experienced climate change in the past without help from humanity.
      But the current climatic warming is occurring much more rapidly than past warming
      events.

      Why Do Scientists Think Current Warming Isn''t Natural?

      In Earth''s history before the Industrial Revolution, Earth''s climate changed
      due to natural causes unrelated to human activity. These natural causes are
      still in play today, but their influence is too small or they occur too slowly
      to explain the rapid warming seen in recent decades.

      How Much More Will Earth Warm?

      Models predict that as the world consumes ever more fossil fuel, greenhouse
      gas concentrations will continue to rise, and Earth''s average surface temperature
      will rise with them. Based on plausible emission scenarios, average surface
      temperatures could rise between 2degC and 6degC by the end of the 21st century.
      Some of this warming will occur even if future greenhouse gas emissions are
      reduced, because the Earth system has not yet fully adjusted to'

      Escherichia coli (E. coli), a prokaryote, is a microscopic single-celled organism.

      Amoebae are single-celled eukaryotes

      Polypore fungi and angiosperm trees are large many-celled eukaryotes.

      In biology, an organism (from Greek: organismos, organismos) is any individual
      entity that embodies the properties of life. It is a synonym for  life form
      .

      Organisms are classified by taxonomy into groups such as multicellular animals,
      plants, and fungi; or unicellular microorganisms such as protists, bacteria,
      and archaea.[1] All types of organisms are capable of reproduction, growth and
      development, maintenance, and some degree of response to stimuli. Humans, squids,
      mushrooms, and vascular plants are examples of multicellular organisms that
      differentiate specialized tissues and organs during development.

      An organism may be either a prokaryote or a eukaryote. Prokaryotes are represented
      by two separate domains - bacteria and archaea. Eukaryotic organisms are characterized
      by the presence of a membrane-bound cell nucleus and contain additional membrane-bound
      compartments called organelles (such as mitochondria in animals and plants and
      plastids in plants and algae, all generally considered to be derived from endosymbiotic
      bacteria).[2] Fungi, animals and plants are examples of kingdoms of organisms
      within the eukaryotes.

      Overview In Depth By the Numbers Exploration Galleries

      IntroductionSaturn''s largest moon Titan is an extraordinary and exceptional
      world. Among our solar system''s more than 150 known moons, Titan is the only
      one with a substantial atmosphere. And of all the places in the solar system,
      Titan is the only place besides Earth known to have liquids in the form of rivers,
      lakes and seas on its surface.

      Titan is larger than the planet Mercury and is the second largest moon in our
      solar system. Jupiter s moon Ganymede is just a little bit larger (by about
      2 percent). Titan''s atmosphere is made mostly of nitrogen, like Earth''s, but
      with a surface pressure 50 percent higher than Earth''s. Titan has clouds, rain,
      rivers, lakes and seas of liquid hydrocarbons like methane and ethane. The largest
      seas are hundreds of feet deep and hundreds of miles wide. Beneath Titan''s
      thick crust of water ice is more liquid--an ocean primarily of water rather
      than methane. Titan''s subsurface water could be a place to harbor life as we
      know it, while its surface lakes and seas of liquid hydrocarbons could conceivably
      harbor life that uses different chemistry than we''re used to--that is, life
      as we don''t yet know it. Titan could also be a lifeless world.

      Part 1: How the Dutch were the first to

      legalize same-sex marriage in 2001.

      1996 - First steps:

      In 1996-APR, the Dutch House of Representatives passed two resolutions. One,
      with a vote of 81 to 60, asked the government to submit a bill before 1997-AUG-1
      which would recognize gay and lesbian relationships. It stated in part:

      There is no objective justification for the ban on marriage of couples of the
      same sex.

      The second resolution passed 83 to 58. It called for legislation that would
      give equal adoption rights for both homosexual couples and single people. COC,
      a national gay rights group called the news  a moral victory. The editor of
      De Gay Krant, the country s largest gay newspaper, commented:

      We do not want a  gay  [partial] wedding like they have in Denmark. We want
      a proper marriage ceremony. If we are equal human beings, we must be given the
      same legal civil status as heterosexuals.

      1996 - Registration of gay and lesbian partnerships:

      A law to register partnerships passed through the Second Chamber of Parliament
      in 1996-DEC with a vote of 104 to 46. Starting 1998-JAN-1, gay lesbian and straight
      couples were able to register their partnership and gain all of the rights,
      privileges and obligations of marriage, except for the right to adopt. Also,
      the divorce procedures are different for registered partnerships and married
      couples. The Dutch Parliament instructed the government to prepare legislation
      to allow gays and lesbians to marry, under existing laws.

      This legislation allowed the registration of gay and lesbian partnerships'

      Divorce Trends in Seven Countries Over the Long Transition from State Socialism:
      1981-2004

      Sunnee Billingsley

      Maria Hornung

      Part of the European Studies of Population book series (ESPO, volume 21)

      The collapse of communism was a defining geopolitical event of late-twentieth
      century Europe, with well-documented economic, social, and political implications.
      Yet there is a striking absence of research on how it influenced divorce. The
      objective of this study is to provide an exploratory analysis of trends in divorce
      over the long transition from communism--starting from the decline of the communist
      economy in the 1980s and ending with economic revival--in seven countries: Bulgaria,
      Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Russia. We discuss how the
      transition could be expected to either increase or decrease divorce risks. We
      analyze retrospective micro-level data on first marriages from the Changing
      Life Course Regimes in Eastern Europe (CLiCR) dataset. Based on our event-history
      analyses, we find that divorce rates increased in each country at some stage
      during the long transition and these increases cannot be explained by compositional
      change of the marriages. However, no uniform pattern emerged in the timing and
      duration of the increase in divorce risk. This striking variation leads us to
      conclude that even the effect of major societal ruptures is contextually contingent.

      Divorce, also known as dissolution of marriage, is the process of terminating
      a marriage or marital union.[1] Divorce usually entails the canceling or reorganizing
      of the legal duties and responsibilities of marriage, thus dissolving the bonds
      of matrimony between a married couple under the rule of law of the particular
      country or state. Divorce laws vary considerably around the world,[1] but in
      most countries divorce requires the sanction of a court or other authority in
      a legal process, which may involve issues of distribution of property,[2] child
      custody,[2] alimony (spousal support), child visitation / access, parenting
      time, child support, and division of debt. In most countries, monogamy is required
      by law, so divorce allows each former partner to marry another person.

      When those that are in a common-law relationship break up, it is referred to
      as separation, instead of a divorce.[3]

      Divorce is different from annulment, which declares the marriage null and void,
      with legal separation or de jure separation (a legal process by which a married
      couple may formalize a de facto separation while remaining legally married)
      or with de facto separation (a process where the spouses informally stop cohabiting).

      Apartheid Comes to an End

      After the National Party gained power in South Africa in 1948, its all-white
      government immediately began enforcing existing policies of racial segregation
      under a system of legislation that it called apartheid. Under apartheid, nonwhite
      South Africans (a majority of the population) would be forced to live in separate
      areas from whites and use separate public facilities, and contact between the
      two groups would be limited. Despite strong and consistent opposition to apartheid
      within and outside of South Africa, its laws remained in effect for the better
      part of 50 years. In 1991, the government of President F.W. de Klerk began to
      repeal most of the legislation that provided the basis for apartheid.

      Racial segregation and white supremacy had become central aspects of South African
      policy long before apartheid began. The controversial 1913 Land Act, passed
      three years after South Africa gained its independence, marked the beginning
      of territorial segregation by forcing black Africans to live in reserves and
      making it illegal for them to work as sharecroppers. Opponents of the Land Act
      formed the South African National Native Congress, which would become the African
      National Congress (ANC).

      Did you know? ANC leader Nelson Mandela, released from prison in February 1990,
      worked closely with President F.W. de Klerk s government to draw up a new constitution
      for South Africa. After both sides made concessions, they reached agreement
      in 1993, and would share the Nobel Peace Prize that year for their efforts.

      In a recent interview, Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) declared it is a scientific
      fact that "human life begins at conception." He also said that "leaders on the
      left" who "wag their fingers" about the "settled science" of global warming
      are hypocrites when it comes to science, and someone should ask them if they
      accept the "consensus of scientists that says that human life begins at conception."

      Going further, the senator added, "I''d like to see someone ask that question.
      It''s never asked. And that''s not even a debatable thing, we can actually see
      that happening. I mean, that is a proven fact. And yet that''s a scientific
      consensus they conveniently choose to ignore."

      In the wake of these remarks, MSNBC reporter Irin Carmon and Washington Post
      blogger Philip Bump pushed back at Rubio, asserting that:

      he made a "scientific blunder on abortion." (Carmon)

      "conception" and "life" "aren''t scientific terms." (Carmon)

      "the scientific experts we spoke with didn''t offer any consensus" on when life
      begins. (Bump)
