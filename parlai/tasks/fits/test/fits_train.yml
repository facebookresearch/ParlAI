      The Wars of the Roses were a series of bloody civil wars for the throne of England
      between two competing royal families: the House of York and the House of Lancaster,
      both members of the age-old royal Plantagenet family. Waged between 1455 and
      1485, the Wars of the Roses earned its flowery name because the white rose was
      the badge of the Yorks, and the red rose was the badge of the Lancastrians.
      After 30 years of political manipulation, horrific carnage and brief periods
      of peace, the wars ended and a new royal dynasty emerged.

      In 1422, Henry VI succeeded his father Henry V and became King of England--at
      just nine months old.

      Thanks to his father''s military conquests, Henry VI also became the disputed
      King of France. In 1445, Henry VI married Margaret of Anjou, a noble and strong-willed
      Frenchwoman whose ambition and political savvy overshadowed her husband''s.

      All was not well in King Henry''s court. He had little interest in politics
      and was a weak ruler. This incited rampant lawlessness throughout his realm
      and opened the door for power-hungry nobles and kingmakers to plot behind his
      back.

      Henry''s lack of leadership led him to lose almost all his holdings in France.
      This and the corruption and mismanagement of power in England, not to mention
      heavy taxation, caused frustrated property owners and peasants from Kent to
      revolt in 1450.

      Wars of the Roses, (1455-85), in English history, the series of dynastic civil
      wars whose violence and civil strife preceded the strong government of the Tudors.
      Fought between the houses of Lancaster and York for the English throne, the
      wars were named many years afterward from the supposed badges of the contending
      parties: the white rose of York and the red rose of Lancaster.

      Both houses claimed the throne through descent from the sons of Edward III.
      Since the Lancastrians had occupied the throne from 1399, the Yorkists might
      never have pressed a claim but for the near anarchy prevailing in the mid-15th
      century. After the death of Henry V in 1422 the country was subject to the long
      and factious minority of Henry VI (August 1422-November 1437), during which
      the English kingdom was managed by the king''s council, a predominantly aristocratic
      body. That arrangement, which probably did not accord with Henry V''s last wishes,
      was not maintained without difficulty. Like Richard II before him, Henry VI
      had powerful relatives eager to grasp after power and to place themselves at
      the head of factions in the state. The council soon became their battleground.

      The War of the Roses Photos

      Divorce lawyer Danny De Vito warns his prospective client that the story he
      s about to tell isn t a pretty one, but the client listens with eager intensity
      -- as do the folks out there in the movie in the audience. The War of the Roses
      can best be described as a slapstick tragedy concerning the decline and literal
      fall of a marriage. After 17 years, Oliver (Michael Douglas) and Barbara (Kathleen
      Turner) Rose want a divorce. Not for this couple is there anything resembling
      a  civilized understanding : Barbara wants their opulent house, and Oliver isn
      t about to part with the domicile. Barbara nails the basement door shut while
      Oliver is downstairs, Oliver disrupts Barbara s fancy party by taking aim at
      the catered dinner, Barbara lays waste to Oliver s sports car....and so it goes,
      culminating in a disastrous showdown around, about and under the living room
      s fancy chandelier. DeVito and screenwriter Michael Leeson never let us forget
      that the couple s self-indulgent imbroglio exacts an awful price upon their
      children (Sean Astin and Heather Fairfield). The War of the Roses was adapted

    - '9 Things You Should Know About the Wars of the Roses

      Explore nine key facts about the bloody feud that permanently altered the course
      of British history.

      1. The Yorks and Lancasters were descended from the same family.

      The Houses of York and Lancaster both traced their lineage to the sons of Edward
      III of the House of Plantagenet, who ruled as England''s king from 1327 until
      1377. The Yorks were descended from the female relatives of Edward''s second
      and fourth sons, while the Lancasters were related to Edward''s third son, John
      of Gaunt. This complicated family tree ensured that both factions had a legitimate
      case for their royal lineage, though by modern standards the Yorkists'' claim
      was undoubtedly stronger. Nevertheless, when the Wars of the Roses first kicked
      off, the Lancasters had been entrenched on the throne since 1399, when Henry
      IV usurped power from his cousin Richard II.

      2. Fallout from the Hundred Years'' War helped spark the unrest.

      The Wars of the Roses might never have happened if not for the tenuous state
      of English politics in the 1450s. The realm was still reeling from its recent
      defeat in the last phase of the Hundred Years'' War with France, which had drained
      royal coffers, fractured the nobility and sent legions of unemployed soldiers
      flooding into the countryside. The sorry state of affairs was compounded by
      the weak and witless reign of the Lancasterian King Henry VI, who suffered from
      a mental illness that often rendered him nearly catatonic. Richard, Duke of
      York was made protector of the realm'

        Both houses claimed the throne through descent from the sons of Edward III.
        Since the Lancastrians had occupied the throne from 1399, the Yorkists might
        never have pressed a claim but for the near anarchy prevailing in the mid-15th
        century. After the death of Henry V in 1422 the country was subject to the
        long and factious minority of Henry VI (August 1422-November 1437), during
        which the English kingdom was managed by the king''s council, a predominantly
        aristocratic body. That arrangement, which probably did not accord with Henry
        V''s last wishes, was not maintained without difficulty. Like Richard II before
        him, Henry VI had powerful relatives eager to grasp after power and to place
        themselves at the head of factions in the state. The council soon became their
        battleground.

        The War of the Roses Photos

        Divorce lawyer Danny De Vito warns his prospective client that the story he
        s about to tell isn t a pretty one, but the client listens with eager intensity
        -- as do the folks out there in the movie in the audience. The War of the
        Roses can best be described as a slapstick tragedy concerning the decline
        and literal fall of a marriage. After 17 years, Oliver (Michael Douglas) and
        Barbara (Kathleen Turner) Rose want a divorce. Not for this couple is there
        anything resembling a  civilized understanding : Barbara wants their opulent
        house, and Oliver isn t about to part with the domicile. Barbara nails the
        basement door shut while Oliver is downstairs, Oliver disrupts Barbara s fancy
        party by taking aim at the catered dinner, Barbara lays waste to Oliver s
        sports car....and so it goes, culminating in a disastrous showdown around,
        about and under the living room s fancy chandelier. DeVito and screenwriter
        Michael Leeson never let us forget that the couple s self-indulgent imbroglio
        exacts an awful price upon their children (Sean Astin and Heather Fairfield).

        Know About the Wars of the Roses

        Explore nine key facts about the bloody feud that permanently altered the
        course of British history.

        1. The Yorks and Lancasters were descended from the same family.

        The Houses of York and Lancaster both traced their lineage to the sons of
        Edward III of the House of Plantagenet, who ruled as England''s king from
        1327 until 1377. The Yorks were descended from the female relatives of Edward''s
        second and fourth sons, while the Lancasters were related to Edward''s third
        son, John of Gaunt. This complicated family tree ensured that both factions
        had a legitimate case for their royal lineage, though by modern standards
        the Yorkists'' claim was undoubtedly stronger. Nevertheless, when the Wars
        of the Roses first kicked off, the Lancasters had been entrenched on the throne
        since 1399, when Henry IV usurped power from his cousin Richard II.

        2. Fallout from the Hundred Years'' War helped spark the unrest.

        The Wars of the Roses might never have happened if not for the tenuous state
        of English politics in the 1450s. The realm was still reeling from its recent
        defeat in the last phase of the Hundred Years'' War with France, which had
        drained royal coffers, fractured the nobility and sent legions of unemployed
        soldiers flooding into the countryside. The sorry state of affairs was compounded
        by the weak and witless reign of the Lancasterian King Henry VI, who suffered
        from a mental illness that often rendered him nearly catatonic. Richard, Duke
        of York was made protector of the realm'

      The Wars of the Roses were a series of bloody civil wars for the throne of England
      between two competing royal families: the House of York and the House of Lancaster,
      both members of the age-old royal Plantagenet family. Waged between 1455 and
      1485, the Wars of the Roses earned its flowery name because the white rose was
      the badge of the Yorks, and the red rose was the badge of the Lancastrians.
      After 30 years of political manipulation, horrific carnage and brief periods
      of peace, the wars ended and a new royal dynasty emerged.

      In 1422, Henry VI succeeded his father Henry V and became King of England--at
      just nine months old.

      Thanks to his father''s military conquests, Henry VI also became the disputed

      Great magnates'
    - 'The Plantaganet King Henry VI was a weak king, married to an ambitious French
      princess, Margaret of Anjou. At this time, there was a complex series of rivalries
      and jealousies at court between powerful noble families. The Queen and her circle
      of nobles were known as Lancastrians after Henry''s surname of Lancaster. The
      party of nobles who opposed the Queen and the Lancastrians was led by Richard,
      Duke of York, Henry''s cousin, who was also descended from King Edward III and
      therefore also had a claim to the throne of England. They were known as Yorkists.

      Henry VI suffered from periods of insanity. During one of these periods in 1454,
      Richard of York was appointed ''Protector of the Realm''. His first act was
      to dismiss some of the Queen''s Lancastrian advisors which caused great bad
      feeling. The King recovered some months later and York was summarily dismissed.

      The weak, sick king was unable to control his ambitious queen on one side, and
      the Yorkist Earl of Warwick, the ''kingmaker'', on the other side.

      Both sides started to recruit soldiers and prepare for war. Many soldiers had
      just returned from the Hundred Years War in France, so recruiting trained men
      to fight was easy. Each side chose a badge: the Red Rose for Lancaster and the
      White Rose for York.

      In 1455, just two years after the end of the Hundred Years War, this dynastic
      civil war broke out. There was tremendous bloodshed as defeated forces on both
      sides were brutally murdered by the victors.

      A Chronology of the Wars of the'
    - 'The Wars of the Roses were a series of bloody battles for the throne of England
      that took place between 1455 and 1487. Fought between the rival Plantagenet
      houses of Lancaster and York, the wars are notorious for their many moments
      of treachery and for the sheer amount of blood they spilled on English soil.

      The wars ended when Richard III, the last Yorkist king, was defeated at the
      Battle of Bosworth in 1485 by Henry Tudor - founder of the house of Tudor.

      Here are 30 facts about the Wars:

      1. The seeds of war were sewn as far back as 1399

      That year Richard II was deposed by his cousin, Henry Bolingbroke who would
      go on to be the Henry IV. This created two competing lines of the Plantagenet
      family, both of which thought they had the rightful claim.

      On the one side there were the descendants of Henry IV - known as the Lancastrians
      - and on the other the heirs of Richard II. In the 1450s, the leader of this
      family was Richard of York; his followers would come to be known as the Yorkists.

      2. When Henry VI came to power he was in an incredible position...

      Thanks to the military successes of his father, Henry V, Henry VI held vast
      swathes of France and was the only King of England to be crowned King of France
      and England.

      3. ...but his foreign policy soon proved disastrous

      Over the course of his reign Henry gradually lost almost all England''s possessions
      in France.

      It culminated in the disastrous defeat at Castillon in'
    - 'In the opening battle of England''s War of the Roses, the Yorkists defeat King
      Henry VI''s Lancastrian forces at St. Albans, 20 miles northwest of London.
      Many Lancastrian nobles perished, including Edmund Beaufort, the duke of Somerset,
      and the king was forced to submit to the rule of his cousin, Richard of York.
      The dynastic struggle between the House of York, whose badge was a white rose,
      and the House of Lancaster, later associated with a red rose, would stretch
      on for 30 years.

      Both families, closely related, claimed the throne through descent from the
      sons of Edward III, the king of England from 1327 to 1377. The first Lancastrian
      king was Henry IV in 1399, and rebellion and lawlessness were rife during his
      reign. His son, Henry V, was more successful and won major victories in the
      Hundred Years War against France. His son and successor, Henry VI, had few kingly
      qualities and lost most of the French land his father had conquered. At home,
      chaos prevailed and lords with private armies challenged Henry VI''s authority.
      At times, his ambitious queen, Margaret of Anjou, effectively controlled the
      crown.

      In 1453, Henry lapsed into insanity, and in 1454 Parliament appointed Richard,
      duke of York, as protector of the realm. Henry and York''s grandfathers were
      the fourth and third sons of Edward III, respectively. When Henry recovered
      in late 1454, he dismissed York and restored the authority of Margaret, who
      saw York as a threat to the succession of their son, Prince Edward. York raised
      an army of 3,000'

        Princes in the Tower

        The Wars of the Roses were a series of bloody civil wars for the throne of
        England between two competing royal families: the House of York and the House
        of Lancaster, both members of the age-old royal Plantagenet family. Waged
        between 1455 and 1485, the Wars of the Roses earned its flowery name because
        the white rose was the badge of the Yorks, and the red rose was the badge
        of the Lancastrians. After 30 years of political manipulation, horrific carnage
        and brief periods of peace, the wars ended and a new royal dynasty emerged.

        In 1422, Henry VI succeeded his father Henry V and became King of England--at
        just nine months old.

        Thanks to his father''s military conquests, Henry VI also became the disputed
        King of France. In 1445, Henry VI married Margaret of Anjou, a noble and strong-willed
        Frenchwoman whose ambition and political savvy overshadowed her husband''s.

        All was not well in King Henry''s court. He had little interest in politics
        and was a weak ruler. This incited rampant lawlessness throughout his realm
        and opened the door for power-hungry nobles and kingmakers to plot behind
        his back.

        Henry''s lack of leadership led him to lose almost all his holdings in France.
        This and the corruption and mismanagement of power in England, not to mention
        heavy taxation, caused frustrated property owners and peasants from Kent to
        revolt in 1450.

        Divorce lawyer Danny De Vito warns his prospective client that the story he
        s about to tell isn t a pretty one, but the client listens with eager intensity
        -- as do the folks out there in the movie in the audience. The War of the
        Roses can best be described as a slapstick tragedy concerning the decline
        and literal fall of a marriage. After 17 years, Oliver (Michael Douglas) and
        Barbara (Kathleen Turner) Rose want a divorce. Not for this couple is there
        anything resembling a  civilized understanding : Barbara wants their opulent
        house, and Oliver isn t about to part with the domicile. Barbara nails the
        basement door shut while Oliver is downstairs, Oliver disrupts Barbara s fancy
        party by taking aim at the catered dinner, Barbara lays waste to Oliver s
        sports car....and so it goes, culminating in a disastrous showdown around,
        about and under the living room s fancy chandelier. DeVito and screenwriter
        Michael Leeson never let us forget that the couple s self-indulgent imbroglio
        exacts an awful price upon their children (Sean Astin and Heather Fairfield).

      - '9 Things You Should Know About the Wars of Roses_0 | 9 Things You Should
        Know About the Wars of the Roses

        Explore nine key facts about the bloody feud that permanently altered the
        course of British history.

        1. The Yorks and Lancasters were descended from the same family.

        The Houses of York and Lancaster both traced their lineage to the sons of
        Edward III of the House of Plantagenet, who ruled as England''s king from
        1327 until 1377. The Yorks were descended from the female relatives of Edward''s
        second and fourth sons, while the Lancasters were related to Edward''s third
        son, John of Gaunt. This complicated family tree ensured that both factions
        had a legitimate case for their royal lineage, though by modern standards
        the Yorkists'' claim was undoubtedly stronger. Nevertheless, when the Wars
        of the Roses first kicked off, the Lancasters had been entrenched on the throne
        since 1399, when Henry IV usurped power from his cousin Richard II.

        2. Fallout from the Hundred Years'' War helped spark the unrest.

        The Wars of the Roses might never have happened if not for the tenuous state
        of English politics in the 1450s. The realm was still reeling from its recent
        defeat in the last phase of the Hundred Years'' War with France, which had
        drained royal coffers, fractured the nobility and sent legions of unemployed
        soldiers flooding into the countryside. The sorry state of affairs was compounded
        by the weak and witless reign of the Lancasterian King Henry VI, who suffered
        from a mental illness that often rendered him nearly catatonic. Richard, Duke
        of York was made protector of the realm'

          Henry V''s last wishes, was not maintained without difficulty. Like Richard
          II before him, Henry VI had powerful relatives eager to grasp after power

        Princes in the Tower

        The Wars of the Roses were a series of bloody civil wars for the throne of
        England between two competing royal families: the House of York and the House
        of Lancaster, both members of the age-old royal Plantagenet family. Waged
        between 1455 and 1485, the Wars of the Roses earned its flowery name because
        the white rose was the badge of the Yorks, and the red rose was the badge
        of the Lancastrians. After 30 years of political manipulation, horrific carnage
        and brief periods of peace, the wars ended and a new royal dynasty emerged.

        In 1422, Henry VI succeeded his father Henry V and became King of England--at
        just nine months old.

        Thanks to his father''s military conquests, Henry VI also became the disputed
        King of France. In 1445, Henry VI married Margaret of Anjou, a noble and strong-willed
        Frenchwoman whose ambition and political savvy overshadowed her husband''s.

        All was not well in King Henry''s court. He had little interest in politics
        and was a weak ruler. This incited rampant lawlessness throughout his realm
        and opened the door for power-hungry nobles and kingmakers to plot behind
        his back.

        Henry''s lack of leadership led him to lose almost all his holdings in France.
        This and the corruption and mismanagement of power in England, not to mention
        heavy taxation, caused frustrated property owners and peasants from Kent to
        revolt in 1450.

        Wars of the Roses, (1455-85), in English history, the series of dynastic civil
        wars whose violence and civil strife preceded the strong government of the
        Tudors. Fought between the houses of Lancaster and York for the English throne,
        the wars were named many years afterward from the supposed badges of the contending
        parties: the white rose of York and the red rose of Lancaster.

        Divorce lawyer Danny De Vito warns his prospective client that the story he
        s about to tell isn t a pretty one, but the client listens with eager intensity
        -- as do the folks out there in the movie in the audience. The War of the
        Roses can best be described as a slapstick tragedy concerning the decline
        and literal fall of a marriage. After 17 years, Oliver (Michael Douglas) and
        Barbara (Kathleen Turner) Rose want a divorce. Not for this couple is there
        anything resembling a  civilized understanding : Barbara wants their opulent
        house, and Oliver isn t about to part with the domicile. Barbara nails the
        basement door shut while Oliver is downstairs, Oliver disrupts Barbara s fancy
        party by taking aim at the catered dinner, Barbara lays waste to Oliver s
        sports car....and so it goes, culminating in a disastrous showdown around,
        about and under the living room s fancy chandelier. DeVito and screenwriter
        Michael Leeson never let us forget that the couple s self-indulgent imbroglio
        exacts an awful price upon their children (Sean Astin and Heather Fairfield).

      - '9 Things You Should Know About the Wars of Roses_0 | 9 Things You Should
        Know About the Wars of the Roses

        Explore nine key facts about the bloody feud that permanently altered the
        course of British history.

        1. The Yorks and Lancasters were descended from the same family.

        The Houses of York and Lancaster both traced their lineage to the sons of
        Edward III of the House of Plantagenet, who ruled as England''s king from
        1327 until 1377. The Yorks were descended from the female relatives of Edward''s
        second and fourth sons, while the Lancasters were related to Edward''s third
        son, John of Gaunt. This complicated family tree ensured that both factions
        had a legitimate case for their royal lineage, though by modern standards
        the Yorkists'' claim was undoubtedly stronger. Nevertheless, when the Wars
        of the Roses first kicked off, the Lancasters had been entrenched on the throne
        since 1399, when Henry IV usurped power from his cousin Richard II.

        2. Fallout from the Hundred Years'' War helped spark the unrest.

        The Wars of the Roses might never have happened if not for the tenuous state
        of English politics in the 1450s. The realm was still reeling from its recent
        defeat in the last phase of the Hundred Years'' War with France, which had
        drained royal coffers, fractured the nobility and sent legions of unemployed
        soldiers flooding into the countryside. The sorry state of affairs was compounded
        by the weak and witless reign of the Lancasterian King Henry VI, who suffered
        from a mental illness that often rendered him nearly catatonic. Richard, Duke
        of York was made protector of the realm'

        The Wars of the Roses were a series of bloody civil wars for the throne of
        England between two competing royal families: the House of York and the House
        of Lancaster, both members of the age-old royal Plantagenet family. Waged
        between 1455 and 1485, the Wars of the Roses earned its flowery name because
        the white rose was the badge of the Yorks, and the red rose was the badge
        of the Lancastrians. After 30 years of political manipulation, horrific carnage
        and brief periods of peace, the wars ended and a new royal dynasty emerged.

        In 1422, Henry VI succeeded his father Henry V and became King of England--at
        just nine months old.

        Thanks to his father''s military conquests, Henry VI also became the disputed
        King of France. In 1445, Henry VI married Margaret of Anjou, a noble and strong-willed
        Frenchwoman whose ambition and political savvy overshadowed her husband''s.

        All was not well in King Henry''s court. He had little interest in politics
        and was a weak ruler. This incited rampant lawlessness throughout his realm
        and opened the door for power-hungry nobles and kingmakers to plot behind
        his back.

        Henry''s lack of leadership led him to lose almost all his holdings in France.
        This and the corruption and mismanagement of power in England, not to mention

        Both houses claimed the throne through descent from the sons of Edward III.
        Since the Lancastrians had occupied the throne from 1399, the Yorkists might
        never have pressed a claim but for the near anarchy prevailing in the mid-15th
        century. After the death of Henry V in 1422 the country was subject to the
        long and factious minority of Henry VI (August 1422-November 1437), during
        which the English kingdom was managed by the king''s council, a predominantly
        aristocratic body. That arrangement, which probably did not accord with Henry
        V''s last wishes, was not maintained without difficulty. Like Richard II before
        him, Henry VI had powerful relatives eager to grasp after power and to place

      - 'Wars of the Roses Timeline The Finer Times_0 | The Wars of the Roses was
        the name given to a series of civil wars that were fought between the House
        of Lancaster and the House of York between 1455 and 1485. The name ''Wars
        of the Roses'' was given because of the badges used by the two opposing groups.
        The Lancastrians brandished a red rose while the Yorkists were represented
        by a white rose.

        The civil conflict came just two years after the Hundred Years War; however
        the civil wars were the product of a number of negative scenarios which led
        to a boiling pot situation in England, where numerous parties fought for the
        contention of the throne.

        This timeline will take a look at some of the event s and battles that occurred
        during the Wars of the Roses.

        During the reign of Lancastrian King Henry VI (1422 - 1461) the first War
        of the Roses battle took place, known as The First Battle of St.Albans on
        May 22, 1455. This marks the start of what will be a bloody civil war for
        England. The battle was a victory for the Yorkist army.

        Battles continue to be fought throughout England at a variety of locations
        over the next few years. These battles include:

        Blore Heath (1459 - Yorkist victory)

        Ludford Bridge (1459 - Lancastrian victory)

        A number of events occurred during 1460. The Lancastrian King Henry VI had
        a number of battles against the Yorkist forces, which were being led by the
        Duke of York and the Earl of Warwick.

        On July 10th 1460 the Battle of Northampton saw the Yorkist forces'

          Henry VI was a weak king, married to an ambitious French princess, Margaret
          of Anjou. At this time, there was a complex series of rivalries and jealousies
          at court between powerful noble families. The Queen and her circle of nobles
          were known as Lancastrians after Henry''s surname of Lancaster. The party

          and therefore also had a claim to the throne of England. They were known
          as Yorkists.

          Henry VI suffered from periods of insanity. During one of these periods

          great bad feeling. The King recovered some months later and York was summarily

          and the Yorkist Earl of Warwick, the ''kingmaker'', on the other side.

        men to fight was easy. Each side chose a badge: the Red Rose for Lancaster
        and the White Rose for York.

        In 1455, just two years after the end of the Hundred Years War, this dynastic
        civil war broke out. There was tremendous bloodshed as defeated forces on
        both sides were brutally murdered by the victors.

        the name given to a series of civil wars that were fought between the House
        of Lancaster and the House of York between 1455 and 1485. The name ''Wars
        of the Roses'' was given because of the badges used by the two opposing groups.
        The Lancastrians brandished a red rose while the Yorkists were represented
        by a white rose.

        The civil conflict came just two years after the Hundred Years War; however
        the civil wars were the product of a number of negative scenarios which led
        to a boiling pot situation in England, where numerous parties fought for the
        contention of the throne.

        This timeline will take a look at some of the event s and battles that occurred
        during the Wars of the Roses.

        During the reign of Lancastrian King Henry VI (1422 - 1461) the first War
        of the Roses battle took place, known as The First Battle of St.Albans on
        May 22, 1455. This marks the start of what will be a bloody civil war for
        England. The battle was a victory for the Yorkist army.

        Battles continue to be fought throughout England at a variety of locations
        over the next few years. These battles include:

        Blore Heath (1459 - Yorkist victory)

        Ludford Bridge (1459 - Lancastrian victory)

        A number of events occurred during 1460. The Lancastrian King Henry VI had
        a number of battles against the Yorkist forces, which were being led by the
        Duke of York and the Earl of Warwick.

        the civil wars fought in England and Wales between the Yorkist and Lancastrian
        dynasties between 1455 and 1485. Though historians can''t agree on precisely
        when and where the conflicts concluded, the general consensus is that the
        Wars of the Roses ended with the battle of Bosworth in 1485, when Henry Tudor
        (the future Henry VII, the first Tudor king) defeated and killed Richard III...

        But, argues historian Matthew Lewis, the roots of these dynastic civil wars
        went deeper and the branches reached further than this 30-year timeframe suggests.
        Here, writing for History Extra, Lewis shares 12 lesser-known facts about
        the Wars of the Roses...

        Jack Cade''s rebellion rocked the Lancastrians

        In July 1450, a mysterious man known as Jack Cade led a huge force of common
        men from Kent into London to protest against the ailing government of the
        Lancastrian king Henry VI. This episode is generally regarded as being outside
        the bounds of the Wars of the Roses, but those edges are blurred and elastic.

        When Jack Cade entered the capital he struck the London Stone, which can still
        be seen on Cannon Street, and, according to Shakespeare, proclaimed: "Now
        is Mortimer lord of this city!" After this, Cade openly adopted the provocative
        name John Mortimer. The Mortimer line was considered by many to be senior
        to the Lancastrian line, since the Mortimers were heirs apparent to Richard
        II - so adding weight to the later Yorkist claim to the throne.

          The Wars of the Roses were a series of bloody civil wars for the throne
          of England between two competing royal families: the House of York and the
          House of Lancaster, both members of the age-old royal Plantagenet family.
          Waged between 1455 and 1485, the Wars of the Roses earned its flowery name
          because the white rose was the badge of the Yorks, and the red rose was
          the badge of the Lancastrians. After 30 years of political manipulation,
          horrific carnage and brief periods of peace, the wars ended and a new royal
          dynasty emerged.

          In 1422, Henry VI succeeded his father Henry V and became King of England--at
          just nine months old.

          Thanks to his father''s military conquests, Henry VI also became the disputed
          King of France. In 1445, Henry VI married Margaret of Anjou, a noble and
          strong-willed Frenchwoman whose ambition and political savvy overshadowed
          her husband''s.

          All was not well in King Henry''s court. He had little interest in politics
          and was a weak ruler. This incited rampant lawlessness throughout his realm
          and opened the door for power-hungry nobles and kingmakers to plot behind
          his back.

          Henry''s lack of leadership led him to lose almost all his holdings in France.
          This and the corruption and mismanagement of power in England, not to mention
          heavy taxation, caused frustrated property owners and peasants from Kent

          Henry VI was a weak king, married to an ambitious French princess, Margaret

        a series of bloody battles for the throne of England that took place between
        1455 and 1487. Fought between the rival Plantagenet houses of Lancaster and
        York, the wars are notorious for their many moments of treachery and for the
        sheer amount of blood they spilled on English soil.

        The wars ended when Richard III, the last Yorkist king, was defeated at the
        Battle of Bosworth in 1485 by Henry Tudor - founder of the house of Tudor.

        Here are 30 facts about the Wars:

        1. The seeds of war were sewn as far back as 1399

        That year Richard II was deposed by his cousin, Henry Bolingbroke who would
        go on to be the Henry IV. This created two competing lines of the Plantagenet
        family, both of which thought they had the rightful claim.

        On the one side there were the descendants of Henry IV - known as the Lancastrians
        - and on the other the heirs of Richard II. In the 1450s, the leader of this
        family was Richard of York; his followers would come to be known as the Yorkists.

        2. When Henry VI came to power he was in an incredible position...

        Thanks to the military successes of his father, Henry V, Henry VI held vast
        swathes of France and was the only King of England to be crowned King of France
        and England.

        3. ...but his foreign policy soon proved disastrous

        Over the course of his reign Henry gradually lost almost all England''s possessions
        in France.

        It culminated in the disastrous defeat at Castillon in'
      - 'The War of the Roses begins HISTORY_0 | In the opening battle of England''s
        War of the Roses, the Yorkists defeat King Henry VI''s Lancastrian forces
        at St. Albans, 20 miles northwest of London. Many Lancastrian nobles perished,
        including Edmund Beaufort, the duke of Somerset, and the king was forced to
        submit to the rule of his cousin, Richard of York. The dynastic struggle between
        the House of York, whose badge was a white rose, and the House of Lancaster,
        later associated with a red rose, would stretch on for 30 years.

        Both families, closely related, claimed the throne through descent from the
        sons of Edward III, the king of England from 1327 to 1377. The first Lancastrian
        king was Henry IV in 1399, and rebellion and lawlessness were rife during
        his reign. His son, Henry V, was more successful and won major victories in
        the Hundred Years War against France. His son and successor, Henry VI, had
        few kingly qualities and lost most of the French land his father had conquered.
        At home, chaos prevailed and lords with private armies challenged Henry VI''s
        authority. At times, his ambitious queen, Margaret of Anjou, effectively controlled
        the crown.

        In 1453, Henry lapsed into insanity, and in 1454 Parliament appointed Richard,
        duke of York, as protector of the realm. Henry and York''s grandfathers were
        the fourth and third sons of Edward III, respectively. When Henry recovered
        in late 1454, he dismissed York and restored the authority of Margaret, who
        saw York as a threat to the succession of their son, Prince Edward. York raised

    - 'This honey baklava is flaky, crisp and tender and I love that it isn''t overly
      sweet. It''s basically a party in your mouth. I am a huge fan of baklava and
      this is the BEST baklava recipe I have ever tried. Hands down.

      You will love the hint of mellow lemony flavor which offsets the sweetness and
      compliments the cinnamon. It''s truly delicious.

      Store-bought baklava has nothing on this and trust me, I''ve been around the
      block when shopping for baklava. This baklava recipe is well loved wherever
      it goes and it is definitely a reader and family favorite!

      How to Make the Best Baklava (See Video Below):

      Ingredients for Baklava Recipe:

      You will need 1 (16 oz) package of phyllo (fillo) dough*; thawed according to
      package instructions *Fillo dough should be paper thin - even thinner than paper.
      Each package has 2 rolls with a total of 40 sheets. Do not use thick sheets
      of fillo dough for this recipe.

      Also, don''t skimp on the butter or any part of the syrup (lemon juice, water
      and honey) since the recipe needs it to moisten and soften the sheets. Otherwise
      the baklava layers can end up dry and won''t stay together easily.

      The chocolate is optional but a nice touch to fancy up a tray of baklava.

      How To Make Baklava:

      1. Thaw phyllo dough according to package instructions (this is best done overnight
      in the fridge, then place it on the counter for 1 hour before starting your
      recipe to bring it to room temp).

      2. Trim phyllo dough to fit your baking sheet. My'

      A traditional, easy, and delicious Italian custard. I had a difficult time finding
      a good and easy recipe on the internet, so I made up my own recipe. It tastes
      just like the panna cotta served at Italian restaurants. Serve with warm hot
      fudge sauce and fresh raspberries on top. This keeps well for several days in
      the refrigerator.

      1 (.25 ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin

      Pour milk into a small bowl, and stir in the gelatin powder. Set aside.

      In a saucepan, stir together the heavy cream and sugar, and set over medium
      heat. Bring to a full boil, watching carefully, as the cream will quickly rise
      to the top of the pan. Pour the gelatin and milk into the cream, stirring until
      completely dissolved. Cook for one minute, stirring constantly. Remove from
      heat, stir in the vanilla and pour into six individual ramekin dishes.

      Cool the ramekins uncovered at room temperature. When cool, cover with plastic
      wrap, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, but preferably overnight before
      serving.

      The loveliest of summer desserts.

      Today I want to show you how to prepare a traditional Cantonese dessert which
      is called red bean soup Hong Dou Sha .

      Red bean soup is in the category of Cantonese desserts called tong sui (Tang
      Shui ), literally means sugar water. It is a popular item on the menu of most
      Chinese dessert houses in Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore. The red bean soup
      is also regularly included in the Chinese banquet package as the concluding
      dish to wrap up a meal.

      What may surprise you is how simple are the ingredients required, only three
      ingredients: red beans, dried tangerine peel, and rock sugar.

      I am keeping this recipe simple, although you can switch it up by incorporating
      some optional ingredients to the basic recipe, which I will explain this further
      in the following sections.

      I will focus on how to prepare the Cantonese way, which requires each bean are
      burst open and disintegrate to form a concentrated suspension.

      Let''s get into the details.

      more info. I may receive commissions for purchases made through links in this
      post. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.

      Step 1. Freeze the red beans

      In this recipe, I''m using 300 g of red beans, and three pieces (about 5g) of
      preserved tangerine peels.

      For the red beans

      Rinse the red beans with water at least twice to remove the impurities and dirt.

      Transfer the red beans into a freezer-safe container, and add sufficient water
      just enough to submerge all the red beans.'

      First, let me assure you that this is the smoothest, creamiest, most melt-in-your-mouth
      leche flan you''ll ever have the pleasure of trying. Second, let me get off
      on a tangent and share with you a personal story.

      The way my ex (husband) wooed me in my youth was through llanera upon llanera
      of leche flan he made himself. Leche flan is his specialty and he being so good
      at it, I was eventually won over by visions of a marriage where I would be sitting
      on the sofa watching TV while he slaved in the kitchen preparing MY dinner.

      Well, these visions never quite turned to reality as I found out soon enough,
      leche flan was how far his kitchen skills went. The way our shared life panned
      out, he sat on the sofa watching TV while I slaved in the kitchen preparing
      HIS dinner. But for every party or gathering, he did take charge of the flan-making
      while I prepared everything else.

      Fast forward decades later~the marriage already crumbled, the resident leche
      flan maker has long wandered into another''s arms~ I find myself standing in
      the kitchen wanting to make flan and not exactly knowing how. You know how it
      is when you marry someone and you assume it''s forever? I never wrote down his
      recipe because I thought he would always be there to make the leche flan.

      In my divorce, I had to face the palpable destruction of what is familiar and
      endure the arduous process of reconstructing myself.'

          Chocolate made with honey is not only possible, it''s downright easy! Honey
          sweetened chocolate still has the same sheen and snap of chocolate made
          with sugar, but you get the benefits of honey instead!

          With just 4 simple ingredients you can have delicious honey chocolate in

          Whether it''s a few chocolate chips in pancakes, chocolate chip cookies,
          or even just a nice piece of homemade peppermint bark... we enjoy chocolate
          around here!

          And while the amount of sugar carbs in a tablespoon of organic chocolate
          chips is pretty low, I knew it was adding up to more sugar than we realized.
          So I started looking into honey sweetened chocolate options and found that
          there was only one organic honey chocolate option out there, and it was
          pretty expensive for me to want to buy on a regular basis!

        And while the amount of sugar carbs in a tablespoon of organic chocolate chips
        is pretty low, I knew it was adding up to more sugar than we realized. So
        I started looking into honey sweetened chocolate options and found that there
        was only one organic honey chocolate option out there, and it was pretty expensive
        for me to want to buy on a regular basis!

        I decided it would be better to attempt to make my own, and thankfully, making
        your own chocolate with honey is really easy!!

        Different varieties lend themselves to different uses,  says Test Kitchen
        Pro and Resident Cooking Light Beekepper Adam Hickman. Clover and orange blossom
        are the workhorse honeys. More abundant (and therefore less expensive), they
        have a straightforward flavor that s great for cooking, baking, or sweetening
        iced tea. Harder-to-come-by varietals, like tupelo and sage,  have nuanced
        flavors you don t want to cook out or mask.  These recipes celebrate the pure,
        sweet liquid gold and make brilliant use of honey s delicious, unique character.

        Did you know? Each bee makes about 1/12 of a teaspoon of honey in its life.
        Honey is the sweet nectar of a bee s lifetime work. These healthy honey recipes
        feature several varietals of honey. Consult your local beekeeper for something
        unique and different if you want to break away from classic clover or orange
        blossom honey.

        Because the wings get a good bit of char, the type of honey you use isn t
        as important here (it ll lose its subtler nuances). Though we remove the skin
        from the wings, you d never know it--they pick up an irresistible crispy crunch
        as the glaze cooks under the broiler. Give yourself a better grip when skinning
        each wing by holding it with a paper towel in one hand and pulling the skin
        with another paper towel in the other hand.

        August 19th is National Honey Bee Day and I think this is a great reason to
        select and share some of my all-time favorite honey recipes. As you can probably
        guess from the name of this website, I am a big fan of honey. I have talked
        to multiple bee keepers and visited countless hives to learn as much as I
        can about nature''s sweetest bounty and it''s creator.

        I have even let bees crawl all over me - some say I''m crazy for doing this
        but I have learned enough to lose much of my fear of being stung. Don''t swat
        at the bees - they''re just looking for their honey.

        Peanut Butter Honey Truffles

        Published October 19, 2012 - Last Updated August 13, 2018

        I wanted to share a quick, easy treat before the weekend, and these Peanut
        Butter Honey Truffles seemed like the perfect choice. I make a batch of these
        little snacks every so often and keep them in the fridge. I learned to make
        them back in elementary school at a summer day camp. Once a week, between
        tie die and ceramics class, they would teach us a new recipe. We made easy
        things like granola and trail mix. Of all the recipes we learned, I liked
        these truffles the best. They''re made from simple, natural, unprocessed ingredients-
        peanut butter, oats, honey, and coconut. What could be bad?

        Back in camp we made the truffles with whole oats, but over the years I''ve
        discovered that I like them better when I blend the oats to a powder. They''re
        perfect for when I need a little protein pick-me-up. The honey satisfies my
        sweet tooth, and the peanut butter satiates my hunger. They''re very filling;
        a couple of truffles totally tide me over between meals. They''re also gluten
        free if you use GF certified oats. They''re really easy to make and you can
        get the kids involved- they''ll have fun rolling the truffles with you. It''s
        simple, unprocessed snack food you can feel good about. Shabbat shalom!

        Today I want to show you how to prepare a traditional Cantonese dessert which
        is called red bean soup Hong Dou Sha .

        Red bean soup is in the category of Cantonese desserts called tong sui (Tang
        Shui ), literally means sugar water. It is a popular item on the menu of most
        Chinese dessert houses in Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore. The red bean
        soup is also regularly included in the Chinese banquet package as the concluding
        dish to wrap up a meal.

        What may surprise you is how simple are the ingredients required, only three
        ingredients: red beans, dried tangerine peel, and rock sugar.

        I am keeping this recipe simple, although you can switch it up by incorporating
        some optional ingredients to the basic recipe, which I will explain this further
        in the following sections.

        I will focus on how to prepare the Cantonese way, which requires each bean
        are burst open and disintegrate to form a concentrated suspension.

        Let''s get into the details.

        for more info. I may receive commissions for purchases made through links
        in this post. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.

        Step 1. Freeze the red beans

        In this recipe, I''m using 300 g of red beans, and three pieces (about 5g)
        of preserved tangerine peels.

        For the red beans

        Rinse the red beans with water at least twice to remove the impurities and
        dirt.

        Transfer the red beans into a freezer-safe container, and add sufficient water
        just enough to submerge all the red beans.'

        First, let me assure you that this is the smoothest, creamiest, most melt-in-your-mouth
        leche flan you''ll ever have the pleasure of trying. Second, let me get off
        on a tangent and share with you a personal story.

        The way my ex (husband) wooed me in my youth was through llanera upon llanera
        of leche flan he made himself. Leche flan is his specialty and he being so
        good at it, I was eventually won over by visions of a marriage where I would
        be sitting on the sofa watching TV while he slaved in the kitchen preparing
        MY dinner.

        Well, these visions never quite turned to reality as I found out soon enough,
        leche flan was how far his kitchen skills went. The way our shared life panned
        out, he sat on the sofa watching TV while I slaved in the kitchen preparing
        HIS dinner. But for every party or gathering, he did take charge of the flan-making
        while I prepared everything else.

        Fast forward decades later~the marriage already crumbled, the resident leche
        flan maker has long wandered into another''s arms~ I find myself standing
        in the kitchen wanting to make flan and not exactly knowing how. You know
        how it is when you marry someone and you assume it''s forever? I never wrote
        down his recipe because I thought he would always be there to make the leche
        flan.

        In my divorce, I had to face the palpable destruction of what is familiar
        and endure the arduous process of reconstructing myself.'

        Red bean soup is in the category of Cantonese desserts called tong sui (Tang

        Chinese dessert houses in Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore. The red bean

        I am keeping this recipe simple, although you can switch it up by incorporating

        Step 1. Freeze the red beans

        In this recipe, I''m using 300 g of red beans, and three pieces (about 5g)
        of preserved tangerine peels.

        For the red beans

        Rinse the red beans with water at least twice to remove the impurities and
        dirt.

        Transfer the red beans into a freezer-safe container, and add sufficient water
        just enough to submerge all the red beans.'

        MY dinner.

        Well, these visions never quite turned to reality as I found out soon enough,
        leche flan was how far his kitchen skills went. The way our shared life panned
        out, he sat on the sofa watching TV while I slaved in the kitchen preparing
        HIS dinner. But for every party or gathering, he did take charge of the flan-making
        while I prepared everything else.

        Fast forward decades later~the marriage already crumbled, the resident leche
        flan maker has long wandered into another''s arms~ I find myself standing
        in the kitchen wanting to make flan and not exactly knowing how. You know
        how it is when you marry someone and you assume it''s forever? I never wrote
        down his recipe because I thought he would always be there to make the leche
        flan.

        In my divorce, I had to face the palpable destruction of what is familiar
        and endure the arduous process of reconstructing myself.'

      How to Make the Best Baklava (See Video Below):

      Ingredients for Baklava Recipe:

      You will need 1 (16 oz) package of phyllo (fillo) dough*; thawed according to
      package instructions *Fillo dough should be paper thin - even thinner than paper.
      Each package has 2 rolls with a total of 40 sheets. Do not use thick sheets
      of fillo dough for this recipe.

      Also, don''t skimp on the butter or any part of the syrup (lemon juice, water
      and honey) since the recipe needs it to moisten and soften the sheets. Otherwise
      the baklava layers can end up dry and won''t stay together easily.

      The chocolate is optional but a nice touch to fancy up a tray of baklava.

      How To Make Baklava:

      1. Thaw phyllo dough according to package instructions (this is best done overnight
      in the fridge, then place it on the counter for 1 hour before starting your
      recipe to bring it to room temp).

      2. Trim phyllo dough to fit your baking sheet. My'

      How to Make Baklava

      Today is all about how to make baklava! You will find different recipes for
      this beloved dessert throughout the Mediterranean and the Middle East. This
      baklava recipe has a bit of a Greek twist to it. Be sure to check out the video
      and step-by-step photos below the recipe!

      When you grow up eating baklava at every gathering, you become a bit of a baklava
      snob. At least I did. So I''ve been on a quest to make the best baklava.

      What qualifies for the "best" baklava?

      To me, it starts with perfectly crisp, yet appropriately honeyed layers of phyllo
      . The right amount of nuts; I like a mix of pistachios, walnuts, and hazelnut.
      And finally, a hint of cinnamon spice nestled in between.

      There is almost nothing as satisfying to me as biting down a crunchy piece of
      baklava drenched in honey syrup. That''s why it''s my dessert of choice for
      special occasions and holidays!

      Important tip for How to Make Baklava

      If you have not made bakalava before, here is one very helpful tip that should
      set you up for success: before you begin assembling your baklava, place the
      thawed phyllo sheets in between two clean and slightly damp kitchen towels.
      This helps the phyllo sheets remain lenient so they won''t tear or break too
      much.

      You can see a few more tips for working with phyllo dough here.

      6 oz walnuts, coarsely chopped

      6 oz hazelnuts, coarsely chopped

      A Greek favorite that makes everyone think you are a master chef and is sooo
      easy to make!! I taught a Greek friend how to make apple pie and she taught
      me this fabulous recipe. The phyllo dough for this recipe is found in the freezer
      section of most grocery stores. Add a little lemon zest to the sugar sauce,
      if desired.

      1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough

      Preheat oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Butter the bottoms and sides of
      a 9x13 inch pan.

      Chop nuts and toss with cinnamon. Set aside. Unroll phyllo dough. Cut whole
      stack in half to fit pan. Cover phyllo with a dampened cloth to keep from drying
      out as you work. Place two sheets of dough in pan, butter thoroughly. Repeat
      until you have 8 sheets layered. Sprinkle 2 - 3 tablespoons of nut mixture on
      top. Top with two sheets of dough, butter, nuts, layering as you go. The top
      layer should be about 6 - 8 sheets deep.

      Using a sharp knife cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to the bottom
      of the pan. You may cut into 4 long rows the make diagonal cuts. Bake for about
      50 minutes until baklava is golden and crisp.

      Make sauce while baklava is baking. Boil sugar and water until sugar is melted.
      Add vanilla and honey. Simmer for about 20 minutes.

      Remove baklava from oven and immediately spoon sauce over it. Let cool. Serve
      in cupcake papers. This freezes well. Leave it uncovered as it gets soggy if
      it'
    - 'Many ethnic festivals are held here throughout the year. One in May is the
      Greek Hellenic Festival. My family enjoys Baklava--a traditional walnut strudel.
      The recipe (below) uses phyllo dough, which is not difficult to work with. Just
      have your ingredients ready to go and follow the directions on the package.
      The results are scrumptious and well worth the effort.  --Judy Losecco, Buffalo

    - 'Honey Baklava Recipe

      Oh my ... layers and layers of flaky phyllo slathered with melted butter, honey
      and loads of nuts - who can resist a slice of this delicious Honey Baklava Recipe?!

      Hey to all our baker-buddies out there! I was wondering, do you have a must-make
      recipe bucket list? I don''t have a formal list per se, but there are tons of
      recipes I want to make and bake, create and eat! Good thing I''m in the recipe
      business! This dessert has been on my mind for years and since it''s too cold
      to do anything outside these days, I thought a nice baking project was just
      the thing for a cozy weekend in the kitchen.

      While this Honey Baklava Recipe is not a new creation in the world of amazing
      desserts, this was the first time I''ve made this delightful and delicious classic.

      To create this recipe I pulled ideas from numerous authentic recipes found around
      the world. After lots of research I used the assembling and baking methods for
      baklava published by Cook''s Illustrated. Ultimately, I was trying to recreate
      a fantastic Honey Baklava we enjoyed in a market in Vienna, Austria last spring.
      And while this baklava recipe isn''t dripping in honey like that we had in the
      Naschmarkt, it certainly has plenty of gooey, sticky yumminess throughout all
      the delicious flaky layers.

      Here at SRFD we have a big pool of taste testers that we use for all our published
      recipes.

      Some taste testers are, of course, family members. But others are friends, friends
      of family'

          Mixed-Nut Honey Baklava

          Yield: 96 (1 1/2-inch) pieces

          12 dried calamyra figs, diced 1/4-inch

          1 1/2 cups toasted walnut pieces, chopped

          1 1/2 cups toasted unblanched almonds, chopped

          1 1/2 cups unsalted butter (3 sticks)

          4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, diced 1/4-inch

          Two (1 pound) boxes phyllo dough (about 48 sheets)

          1 cup honey (preferably orange blossom), plus more for drizzling

          Juice of 1 large lemon (about 3 tablespoons)

          Soak the diced figs in the rum in a large bowl for at least 30 minutes and
          up to 2 hours.

          Spread the walnuts and almonds out on a baking sheet and toast until darkened
          and fragrant, about 8 to 10 minutes. Cool. Toss the nuts, chocolate, sugar,
          and spices with the figs and the rum.

          Bring the butter to a simmer over low heat. Skim and discard the foamy solids
          that rise to the top until the butter is clear, about 8 to 10 minutes.

          Lightly butter a 16 1/2 by 11 1/2-inch sheet pan. Remove the phyllo from
          the package, unroll and lay it on the counter next to the pan and cover
          with a kitchen towel. Lay 1 sheet of the phyllo on the pan and brush lightly
          with butter. Repeat with 11 more sheets of phyllo working quickly and keeping
          the phyllo covered, as you assemble the baklava. Scatter 1/3 of the nut
          mixture (about 1 1/2 cups) evenly over the layers of phyllo. Repeat 2 more
          times and top with the remaining 12 sheets of dough. Carefully, cut 3/4
          of the way through the phyllo and nut filling to make about 96 (1 1/2-inch)

        How to Make Baklava

        Today is all about how to make baklava! You will find different recipes for
        this beloved dessert throughout the Mediterranean and the Middle East. This
        baklava recipe has a bit of a Greek twist to it. Be sure to check out the
        video and step-by-step photos below the recipe!

        When you grow up eating baklava at every gathering, you become a bit of a
        baklava snob. At least I did. So I''ve been on a quest to make the best baklava.

        What qualifies for the "best" baklava?

        To me, it starts with perfectly crisp, yet appropriately honeyed layers of
        phyllo . The right amount of nuts; I like a mix of pistachios, walnuts, and
        hazelnut. And finally, a hint of cinnamon spice nestled in between.

        There is almost nothing as satisfying to me as biting down a crunchy piece
        of baklava drenched in honey syrup. That''s why it''s my dessert of choice
        for special occasions and holidays!

        Important tip for How to Make Baklava

        If you have not made bakalava before, here is one very helpful tip that should
        set you up for success: before you begin assembling your baklava, place the
        thawed phyllo sheets in between two clean and slightly damp kitchen towels.
        This helps the phyllo sheets remain lenient so they won''t tear or break too
        much.

        Yield: 96 (1 1/2-inch) pieces

        12 dried calamyra figs, diced 1/4-inch

        1 1/2 cups toasted walnut pieces, chopped

        1 1/2 cups toasted unblanched almonds, chopped

        1 1/2 cups unsalted butter (3 sticks)

        4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, diced 1/4-inch

        Two (1 pound) boxes phyllo dough (about 48 sheets)

        1 cup honey (preferably orange blossom), plus more for drizzling

        Juice of 1 large lemon (about 3 tablespoons)

        Soak the diced figs in the rum in a large bowl for at least 30 minutes and
        up to 2 hours.

        Spread the walnuts and almonds out on a baking sheet and toast until darkened
        and fragrant, about 8 to 10 minutes. Cool. Toss the nuts, chocolate, sugar,
        and spices with the figs and the rum.

        Bring the butter to a simmer over low heat. Skim and discard the foamy solids
        that rise to the top until the butter is clear, about 8 to 10 minutes.

        Lightly butter a 16 1/2 by 11 1/2-inch sheet pan. Remove the phyllo from the
        package, unroll and lay it on the counter next to the pan and cover with a
        kitchen towel. Lay 1 sheet of the phyllo on the pan and brush lightly with
        butter. Repeat with 11 more sheets of phyllo working quickly and keeping the
        phyllo covered, as you assemble the baklava. Scatter 1/3 of the nut mixture
        (about 1 1/2 cups) evenly over the layers of phyllo. Repeat 2 more times and
        top with the remaining 12 sheets of dough. Carefully, cut 3/4 of the way through
        the phyllo and nut filling to make about 96 (1 1/2-inch) squares.

        (1200g) 36 Sheets Filo Pastry

        500g Walnuts Ensure that the Walnuts are crushed into pieces

        Ensure that the Walnuts are crushed into pieces

        Honey Baklava is made with fresh honey straight out of the hive in Albania.
        All Albanian desserts are covered in a sweet sauce, normally a sugar syrup
        which could be used instead of honey if you wish. Desserts are served cold,
        with syrps soaked in and normally two pieces at a time too.

        For this recipe, I use walnuts but why not try experimenting with different
        options such as pistachio or even fruits - I am working on a nice nut free
        Baklava made with fruits - and maybe a hint of coconut!

        Filo Pastry will dry out very quick - ensure you keep the damp tea towel over
        the pastry as much as possible while making your Baklava.

        Make the honey syrup

        This syrup can cool while your Baklava is cooking. Add the honey, water and
        sugar into a saucepan and bring to a boil while continuously stirring. Once
        the sugar has melted, leave to boil on a medium heat for 5 minutes and then
        move to one side to cool.

        Mix the ground walnuts and cinnamon together and set aside.

        Measure your filo pastry ready for the Baklava verses the size of baking tray
        being used - you will need a size that is about 30cm x 20cm and 6cm deep,
        cut the filo pastry to size and cover with a damp tea towel to keep the pastry
        moist.

        A Greek favorite that makes everyone think you are a master chef and is sooo
        easy to make!! I taught a Greek friend how to make apple pie and she taught
        me this fabulous recipe. The phyllo dough for this recipe is found in the
        freezer section of most grocery stores. Add a little lemon zest to the sugar
        sauce, if desired.

        1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough

        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Butter the bottoms and sides
        of a 9x13 inch pan.

        Chop nuts and toss with cinnamon. Set aside. Unroll phyllo dough. Cut whole
        stack in half to fit pan. Cover phyllo with a dampened cloth to keep from
        drying out as you work. Place two sheets of dough in pan, butter thoroughly.
        Repeat until you have 8 sheets layered. Sprinkle 2 - 3 tablespoons of nut
        mixture on top. Top with two sheets of dough, butter, nuts, layering as you
        go. The top layer should be about 6 - 8 sheets deep.

        Using a sharp knife cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to the bottom
        of the pan. You may cut into 4 long rows the make diagonal cuts. Bake for
        about 50 minutes until baklava is golden and crisp.

        Make sauce while baklava is baking. Boil sugar and water until sugar is melted.
        Add vanilla and honey. Simmer for about 20 minutes.

        Remove baklava from oven and immediately spoon sauce over it. Let cool. Serve

        and fragrant, about 8 to 10 minutes. Cool. Toss the nuts, chocolate, sugar,
        and spices with the figs and the rum.

        Bring the butter to a simmer over low heat. Skim and discard the foamy solids
        that rise to the top until the butter is clear, about 8 to 10 minutes.

        Lightly butter a 16 1/2 by 11 1/2-inch sheet pan. Remove the phyllo from the
        package, unroll and lay it on the counter next to the pan and cover with a
        kitchen towel. Lay 1 sheet of the phyllo on the pan and brush lightly with
        butter. Repeat with 11 more sheets of phyllo working quickly and keeping the
        phyllo covered, as you assemble the baklava. Scatter 1/3 of the nut mixture
        (about 1 1/2 cups) evenly over the layers of phyllo. Repeat 2 more times and
        top with the remaining 12 sheets of dough. Carefully, cut 3/4 of the way through
        the phyllo and nut filling to make about 96 (1 1/2-inch) squares.

        (1200g) 36 Sheets Filo Pastry

        500g Walnuts Ensure that the Walnuts are crushed into pieces

        Ensure that the Walnuts are crushed into pieces

        Honey Baklava is made with fresh honey straight out of the hive in Albania.
        All Albanian desserts are covered in a sweet sauce, normally a sugar syrup
        which could be used instead of honey if you wish. Desserts are served cold,
        with syrps soaked in and normally two pieces at a time too.

        For this recipe, I use walnuts but why not try experimenting with different
        options such as pistachio or even fruits - I am working on a nice nut free
        Baklava made with fruits - and maybe a hint of coconut!

        Filo Pastry will dry out very quick - ensure you keep the damp tea towel over
        the pastry as much as possible while making your Baklava.

        Make the honey syrup

        This syrup can cool while your Baklava is cooking. Add the honey, water and
        sugar into a saucepan and bring to a boil while continuously stirring. Once
        the sugar has melted, leave to boil on a medium heat for 5 minutes and then
        move to one side to cool.

        Mix the ground walnuts and cinnamon together and set aside.

        Measure your filo pastry ready for the Baklava verses the size of baking tray
        being used - you will need a size that is about 30cm x 20cm and 6cm deep,
        cut the filo pastry to size and cover with a damp tea towel to keep the pastry
        moist.

          How to Make Baklava

          Today is all about how to make baklava! You will find different recipes
          for this beloved dessert throughout the Mediterranean and the Middle East.
          This baklava recipe has a bit of a Greek twist to it. Be sure to check out
          the video and step-by-step photos below the recipe!

          When you grow up eating baklava at every gathering, you become a bit of
          a baklava snob. At least I did. So I''ve been on a quest to make the best
          baklava.

          What qualifies for the "best" baklava?

          To me, it starts with perfectly crisp, yet appropriately honeyed layers
          of phyllo . The right amount of nuts; I like a mix of pistachios, walnuts,
          and hazelnut. And finally, a hint of cinnamon spice nestled in between.

          There is almost nothing as satisfying to me as biting down a crunchy piece
          of baklava drenched in honey syrup. That''s why it''s my dessert of choice
          for special occasions and holidays!

          Important tip for How to Make Baklava

          If you have not made bakalava before, here is one very helpful tip that
          should set you up for success: before you begin assembling your baklava,
          place the thawed phyllo sheets in between two clean and slightly damp kitchen
          towels. This helps the phyllo sheets remain lenient so they won''t tear
          or break too much.

        Oh my ... layers and layers of flaky phyllo slathered with melted butter,

        Recipe?!

        Hey to all our baker-buddies out there! I was wondering, do you have a must-make
        recipe bucket list? I don''t have a formal list per se, but there are tons
        of recipes I want to make and bake, create and eat! Good thing I''m in the
        recipe business! This dessert has been on my mind for years and since it''s
        too cold to do anything outside these days, I thought a nice baking project
        was just the thing for a cozy weekend in the kitchen.

        While this Honey Baklava Recipe is not a new creation in the world of amazing
        desserts, this was the first time I''ve made this delightful and delicious
        classic.

        To create this recipe I pulled ideas from numerous authentic recipes found
        around the world. After lots of research I used the assembling and baking
        methods for baklava published by Cook''s Illustrated. Ultimately, I was trying
        to recreate a fantastic Honey Baklava we enjoyed in a market in Vienna, Austria
        last spring. And while this baklava recipe isn''t dripping in honey like that
        we had in the Naschmarkt, it certainly has plenty of gooey, sticky yumminess
        throughout all the delicious flaky layers.

        Here at SRFD we have a big pool of taste testers that we use for all our published
        recipes.

          How to Make the Best Baklava (See Video Below):

          Ingredients for Baklava Recipe:

          You will need 1 (16 oz) package of phyllo (fillo) dough*; thawed according
          to package instructions *Fillo dough should be paper thin - even thinner
          than paper. Each package has 2 rolls with a total of 40 sheets. Do not use
          thick sheets of fillo dough for this recipe.

          Also, don''t skimp on the butter or any part of the syrup (lemon juice,
          water and honey) since the recipe needs it to moisten and soften the sheets.
          Otherwise the baklava layers can end up dry and won''t stay together easily.

          The chocolate is optional but a nice touch to fancy up a tray of baklava.

          How To Make Baklava:

          1. Thaw phyllo dough according to package instructions (this is best done
          overnight in the fridge, then place it on the counter for 1 hour before
          starting your recipe to bring it to room temp).

          When you grow up eating baklava at every gathering, you become a bit of
          a baklava snob. At least I did. So I''ve been on a quest to make the best
          baklava.

          What qualifies for the "best" baklava?

          To me, it starts with perfectly crisp, yet appropriately honeyed layers
          of phyllo . The right amount of nuts; I like a mix of pistachios, walnuts,
          and hazelnut. And finally, a hint of cinnamon spice nestled in between.

          There is almost nothing as satisfying to me as biting down a crunchy piece
          of baklava drenched in honey syrup. That''s why it''s my dessert of choice

        Oh my ... layers and layers of flaky phyllo slathered with melted butter,
        honey and loads of nuts - who can resist a slice of this delicious Honey Baklava
        Recipe?!

        Hey to all our baker-buddies out there! I was wondering, do you have a must-make
        recipe bucket list? I don''t have a formal list per se, but there are tons
        of recipes I want to make and bake, create and eat! Good thing I''m in the
        recipe business! This dessert has been on my mind for years and since it''s
        too cold to do anything outside these days, I thought a nice baking project
        was just the thing for a cozy weekend in the kitchen.

        While this Honey Baklava Recipe is not a new creation in the world of amazing
        desserts, this was the first time I''ve made this delightful and delicious
        classic.

        To create this recipe I pulled ideas from numerous authentic recipes found
        around the world. After lots of research I used the assembling and baking
        methods for baklava published by Cook''s Illustrated. Ultimately, I was trying
        to recreate a fantastic Honey Baklava we enjoyed in a market in Vienna, Austria
        last spring. And while this baklava recipe isn''t dripping in honey like that
        we had in the Naschmarkt, it certainly has plenty of gooey, sticky yumminess
        throughout all the delicious flaky layers.

        Here at SRFD we have a big pool of taste testers that we use for all our published
        recipes.

        Some taste testers are, of course, family members. But others are friends,

        - What qualifies for the "best" baklava?
        - To me, it starts with perfectly crisp, yet appropriately honeyed layers
          of phyllo . The right amount of nuts; I like a mix of pistachios, walnuts,

        it goes and it is definitely a reader and family favorite!

        How to Make the Best Baklava (See Video Below):

        Ingredients for Baklava Recipe:

        You will need 1 (16 oz) package of phyllo (fillo) dough*; thawed according
        to package instructions *Fillo dough should be paper thin - even thinner than
        paper. Each package has 2 rolls with a total of 40 sheets. Do not use thick
        sheets of fillo dough for this recipe.

        Also, don''t skimp on the butter or any part of the syrup (lemon juice, water
        and honey) since the recipe needs it to moisten and soften the sheets. Otherwise
        the baklava layers can end up dry and won''t stay together easily.

        The chocolate is optional but a nice touch to fancy up a tray of baklava.

        How To Make Baklava:

        1. Thaw phyllo dough according to package instructions (this is best done
        overnight in the fridge, then place it on the counter for 1 hour before starting
        your recipe to bring it to room temp).

        Oh my ... layers and layers of flaky phyllo slathered with melted butter,
        honey and loads of nuts - who can resist a slice of this delicious Honey Baklava
        Recipe?!

        Hey to all our baker-buddies out there! I was wondering, do you have a must-make
        recipe bucket list? I don''t have a formal list per se, but there are tons
        of recipes I want to make and bake, create and eat! Good thing I''m in the
        recipe business! This dessert has been on my mind for years and since it''s
        too cold to do anything outside these days, I thought a nice baking project
        was just the thing for a cozy weekend in the kitchen.

        While this Honey Baklava Recipe is not a new creation in the world of amazing
        desserts, this was the first time I''ve made this delightful and delicious
        classic.

        To create this recipe I pulled ideas from numerous authentic recipes found
        around the world. After lots of research I used the assembling and baking
        methods for baklava published by Cook''s Illustrated. Ultimately, I was trying
        to recreate a fantastic Honey Baklava we enjoyed in a market in Vienna, Austria
        last spring. And while this baklava recipe isn''t dripping in honey like that
        we had in the Naschmarkt, it certainly has plenty of gooey, sticky yumminess
        throughout all the delicious flaky layers.

        Here at SRFD we have a big pool of taste testers that we use for all our published
        recipes.

        Some taste testers are, of course, family members. But others are friends,

      For more than 100 million years sea turtles have covered vast distances across
      the world s oceans, filling a vital role in the balance of marine habitats.

      Cheloniidae and Dermochelyidae families

      e Habitats

      Open water and coasts

      Seven different species of sea (or marine) turtles grace our ocean waters, from
      the shallow seagrass beds of the Indian Ocean, to the colorful reefs of the
      Coral Triangle, and even the sandy beaches of the Eastern Pacific. WWF''s work
      on sea turtles focuses on five of those species: green, hawksbill, loggerhead,
      leatherback and olive ridley.

      Human activities have tipped the scales against the survival of these ancient
      mariners. Nearly all species of sea turtle are classified as Endangered. Slaughtered
      for their eggs, meat, skin and shells, sea turtles suffer from poaching and
      over-exploitation. They also face habitat destruction and accidental capture
      in fishing gear. Climate change has an impact on turtle nesting sites. It alters
      sand temperatures, which then affects the sex of hatchlings.

      WWF is committed to stop the decline of sea turtles and work for the recovery
      of the species. We work to secure environments in which both turtles--and the
      people that depend upon them--can survive into the future.

      The following is a compilation of fascinating facts to test your sea turtle
      knowledge. Shown here: loggerhead turtle hatchlings make their way to the sea
      in Juno Beach, Florida. Image courtesy of Veronica Runge.

      Sea turtles are ancient species, having been around since the time of the dinosaurs
      -- about 110 million years.

      All six sea turtle species found in U.S. waters are protected by the Endangered
      Species Act. They are the green, hawksbill, Kemp s ridley, leatherback, loggerhead,
      and olive ridley. The flatback turtle is found only in Australia and Papua New
      Guinea.

      The leatherback is the largest sea turtle species, weighing up to 2,000 pounds
      and measuring from 6-9 feet long. Its shell (carapace) is strong and flexible,
      like leather -- thus the name.

      The green is the largest hard-shelled sea turtle. It grows from a two-inch hatchling
      weighing one-half pound to an adult size of 3 feet long and 300-350 lbs.

      It takes 20-30 years for a sea turtle to reach sexual maturity. When a female
      is ready to lay eggs, she returns to the nesting beach where she was born, even
      if she has not been there for 30 years! Some females nest every year until the
      age of 80.

      The Kemp s Ridley is the only sea turtle that nests predominantly during daylight
      hours. They often gather in a large group to come ashore and nest, which is
      called an arribada -- Spanish for  arrival.

    - 'How long do sea turtles live? And other sea turtle facts

      Sea turtles have roamed the Earth''s oceans for the last 110 million years.
      An important link to marine ecosystems, such as coral reefs and seagrass beds,
      some sea turtles also eat large numbers of jellyfish and provide a source of
      income to local communities as a draw for ecotourism. But sea turtle populations
      have been on the decline. Thousands of marine turtles are accidentally caught
      by fishing gear each year, and the beaches upon which they depend for nesting
      are disappearing.

      WWF works with local communities to reduce egg harvesting and protect nesting
      beaches, and encourages fishers to switch to turtle-friendly equipment.

      Here''s a look at some common questions about sea turtles.

      How long do sea turtles live?

      The actual documentation of the age of any species of sea turtle is difficult.
      What we do know is that sea turtles live a long time (some can live up to 50
      years or more) and have similar lifespans to humans. Most marine turtles take
      decades to mature--between 20 and 30 years--and remain actively reproductive
      for another 10 years.

      Why are sea turtles endangered?

      Nearly all seven species of sea turtle are classified as endangered, and that''s
      mostly due to human activity. Accidental capture by fishing gear, which often
      results in death, is the greatest threat to most sea turtles. They are also
      killed for their eggs, meat, skin and shells, and suffer from poaching and over-exploitation.
      Climate change also impacts sea turtle nesting beaches and eggs. WWF helps develop
      alternative livelihoods so that'
    - 'Facts about sea turtles including habitat, diet, threats, and more.

      Hawksbills

      From leatherbacks to loggerheads, six of the seven species of sea turtles are
      threatened or endangered at the hand of humans. Sadly, the fact is that they
      face many dangers as they travel the seas -- including accidental capture and
      entanglement in fishing gear (also known as bycatch), the loss of nesting and
      feeding sites to coastal development, poaching, and ocean pollution including
      plastic.

      These creatures are well-adapted to the ocean though they require air to survive.
      Their size varies greatly, depending upon species -- from the small Kemp''s

      Habitat & Diet

      Sea turtles live in almost every ocean basin throughout the world, nesting on
      tropical and subtropical beaches. They migrate long distances to feed, often
      crossing entire oceans. Some loggerheads nest in Japan and migrate to Baja California
      Sur, Mexico to forage before returning home again. Leatherbacks are capable
      of withstanding the coldest water temperatures (often below 40@F) and are found
      as far south as Chile and as far north as Alaska.

      These reptiles spend their entire lives at sea, except when adult females come
      ashore to lay eggs several times per season every 2 to 5 years. After about
      sixty days, baby sea turtles (known as  hatchlings ) emerge from their sandy
      nests and make their way to the ocean --attracted to the distant horizon. The
      juvenile turtles spend their first few years in the open oceans, eventually

          The following is a compilation of fascinating facts to test your sea turtle
          knowledge. Shown here: loggerhead turtle hatchlings make their way to the
          sea in Juno Beach, Florida. Image courtesy of Veronica Runge.

          Sea turtles are ancient species, having been around since the time of the
          dinosaurs -- about 110 million years.

          All six sea turtle species found in U.S. waters are protected by the Endangered
          Species Act. They are the green, hawksbill, Kemp s ridley, leatherback,
          loggerhead, and olive ridley. The flatback turtle is found only in Australia
          and Papua New Guinea.

          The leatherback is the largest sea turtle species, weighing up to 2,000
          pounds and measuring from 6-9 feet long. Its shell (carapace) is strong
          and flexible, like leather -- thus the name.

          The green is the largest hard-shelled sea turtle. It grows from a two-inch
          hatchling weighing one-half pound to an adult size of 3 feet long and 300-350
          lbs.

          It takes 20-30 years for a sea turtle to reach sexual maturity. When a female
          is ready to lay eggs, she returns to the nesting beach where she was born,
          even if she has not been there for 30 years! Some females nest every year
          until the age of 80.

          The Kemp s Ridley is the only sea turtle that nests predominantly during
          daylight hours. They often gather in a large group to come ashore and nest,
          which is called an arribada -- Spanish for  arrival.

        live? And other sea turtle facts

        Sea turtles have roamed the Earth''s oceans for the last 110 million years.
        An important link to marine ecosystems, such as coral reefs and seagrass beds,
        some sea turtles also eat large numbers of jellyfish and provide a source
        of income to local communities as a draw for ecotourism. But sea turtle populations
        have been on the decline. Thousands of marine turtles are accidentally caught
        by fishing gear each year, and the beaches upon which they depend for nesting
        are disappearing.

        WWF works with local communities to reduce egg harvesting and protect nesting
        beaches, and encourages fishers to switch to turtle-friendly equipment.

        Here''s a look at some common questions about sea turtles.

        How long do sea turtles live?

        The actual documentation of the age of any species of sea turtle is difficult.
        What we do know is that sea turtles live a long time (some can live up to
        50 years or more) and have similar lifespans to humans. Most marine turtles
        take decades to mature--between 20 and 30 years--and remain actively reproductive
        for another 10 years.

        Why are sea turtles endangered?

        Nearly all seven species of sea turtle are classified as endangered, and that''s
        mostly due to human activity. Accidental capture by fishing gear, which often
        results in death, is the greatest threat to most sea turtles. They are also
        killed for their eggs, meat, skin and shells, and suffer from poaching and
        over-exploitation. Climate change also impacts sea turtle nesting beaches
        and eggs. WWF helps develop alternative livelihoods so that'

        Hawksbills

        From leatherbacks to loggerheads, six of the seven species of sea turtles
        are threatened or endangered at the hand of humans. Sadly, the fact is that
        they face many dangers as they travel the seas -- including accidental capture
        and entanglement in fishing gear (also known as bycatch), the loss of nesting
        and feeding sites to coastal development, poaching, and ocean pollution including
        plastic.

        These creatures are well-adapted to the ocean though they require air to survive.
        Their size varies greatly, depending upon species -- from the small Kemp''s
        ridley, which weighs between 80-100 pounds, to the enormous leatherback, which
        can weigh more than 1,000 pounds.

        Habitat & Diet

        Sea turtles live in almost every ocean basin throughout the world, nesting
        on tropical and subtropical beaches. They migrate long distances to feed,

          pounds and measuring from 6-9 feet long. Its shell (carapace) is strong
          and flexible, like leather -- thus the name.

          The green is the largest hard-shelled sea turtle. It grows from a two-inch
          hatchling weighing one-half pound to an adult size of 3 feet long and 300-350
          lbs.

          It takes 20-30 years for a sea turtle to reach sexual maturity. When a female
          is ready to lay eggs, she returns to the nesting beach where she was born,

        For more than 100 million years sea turtles have covered vast distances across
        the world s oceans, filling a vital role in the balance of marine habitats.

        Seven different species of sea (or marine) turtles grace our ocean waters,
        from the shallow seagrass beds of the Indian Ocean, to the colorful reefs
        of the Coral Triangle, and even the sandy beaches of the Eastern Pacific.
        WWF''s work on sea turtles focuses on five of those species: green, hawksbill,
        loggerhead, leatherback and olive ridley.

        Human activities have tipped the scales against the survival of these ancient
        mariners. Nearly all species of sea turtle are classified as Endangered. Slaughtered
        for their eggs, meat, skin and shells, sea turtles suffer from poaching and
        over-exploitation. They also face habitat destruction and accidental capture
        in fishing gear. Climate change has an impact on turtle nesting sites. It
        alters sand temperatures, which then affects the sex of hatchlings.

        WWF is committed to stop the decline of sea turtles and work for the recovery
        of the species. We work to secure environments in which both turtles--and
        the people that depend upon them--can survive into the future.

        live? And other sea turtle facts

        Sea turtles have roamed the Earth''s oceans for the last 110 million years.
        An important link to marine ecosystems, such as coral reefs and seagrass beds,
        some sea turtles also eat large numbers of jellyfish and provide a source
        of income to local communities as a draw for ecotourism. But sea turtle populations
        have been on the decline. Thousands of marine turtles are accidentally caught
        by fishing gear each year, and the beaches upon which they depend for nesting
        are disappearing.

        WWF works with local communities to reduce egg harvesting and protect nesting
        beaches, and encourages fishers to switch to turtle-friendly equipment.

        Here''s a look at some common questions about sea turtles.

        How long do sea turtles live?

        The actual documentation of the age of any species of sea turtle is difficult.
        What we do know is that sea turtles live a long time (some can live up to
        50 years or more) and have similar lifespans to humans. Most marine turtles
        take decades to mature--between 20 and 30 years--and remain actively reproductive
        for another 10 years.

        Why are sea turtles endangered?

        Nearly all seven species of sea turtle are classified as endangered, and that''s
        mostly due to human activity. Accidental capture by fishing gear, which often
        results in death, is the greatest threat to most sea turtles. They are also
        killed for their eggs, meat, skin and shells, and suffer from poaching and
        over-exploitation. Climate change also impacts sea turtle nesting beaches
        and eggs. WWF helps develop alternative livelihoods so that'

        Hawksbills

        From leatherbacks to loggerheads, six of the seven species of sea turtles
        are threatened or endangered at the hand of humans. Sadly, the fact is that
        they face many dangers as they travel the seas -- including accidental capture
        and entanglement in fishing gear (also known as bycatch), the loss of nesting
        and feeding sites to coastal development, poaching, and ocean pollution including
        plastic.

        These creatures are well-adapted to the ocean though they require air to survive.
        Their size varies greatly, depending upon species -- from the small Kemp''s
        ridley, which weighs between 80-100 pounds, to the enormous leatherback, which
        can weigh more than 1,000 pounds.

        Habitat & Diet

        Sea turtles live in almost every ocean basin throughout the world, nesting
        on tropical and subtropical beaches. They migrate long distances to feed,
        often crossing entire oceans. Some loggerheads nest in Japan and migrate to
        Baja California Sur, Mexico to forage before returning home again. Leatherbacks
        are capable of withstanding the coldest water temperatures (often below 40@F)
        and are found as far south as Chile and as far north as Alaska.

        These reptiles spend their entire lives at sea, except when adult females
        come ashore to lay eggs several times per season every 2 to 5 years. After
        about sixty days, baby sea turtles (known as  hatchlings ) emerge from their
        sandy nests and make their way to the ocean --attracted to the distant horizon.
        The juvenile turtles spend their first few years in the open oceans, eventually
        moving to protected'
