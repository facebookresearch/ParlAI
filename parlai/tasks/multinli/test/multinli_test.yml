    text: 'Premise: The answer has nothing to do with their cause, however, but with
      the simple fact that dictionaries are not exercises in bi-unique substitutability;
      in other words, if one of the senses of run is `operate'' (as in She runs an
      engine factory ), that does not make it valid to assume that one can substitute
      operate for run in We run in the marathon every year .  Although recognizing
      this as a shortcoming of dictionaries and assigning it arbitrarily to what,
      for lack of a better term, we might call the  genius  of the language, might
      seem trivial to the casual observer, it is a valid matter for concern in the
      realm of lexicology.

      Hypothesis: Dictionaries are indeed exercises in bi-unique substitutability.'
