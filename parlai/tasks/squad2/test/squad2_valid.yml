    text: 'The Normans (Norman: Nourmands; French: Normands; Latin: Normanni) were
      the people who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name to Normandy, a
      region in France. They were descended from Norse ("Norman" comes from "Norseman")
      raiders and pirates from Denmark, Iceland and Norway who, under their leader
      Rollo, agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia. Through generations
      of assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish and Roman-Gaulish populations,
      their descendants would gradually merge with the Carolingian-based cultures
      of West Francia. The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged
      initially in the first half of the 10th century, and it continued to evolve
      over the succeeding centuries.
