    - Actually term life insurance can not be paid up . It just expires or has a steep
      premium increase many times 1,000 % . The cash value policies such as whole
      life , universal life , indexed universal life or variable universal life do
      endow or are `` paid up '' plans in which you are asking . Sorry !
    - Term life insurance is never paid up . Assuming you make your premium payments
      , if you are still alive at the end of the term life insurance policy 's stated
      time period -LRB- e.g. - 10 years -RRB- the policy ends and the life insurance
      protection ceases . In this case the insurance company has won the bet , you
      did n't die during the period the policy was taken out for and they get to keep
      all the premium paid for taking on your risk during that time period . The only
      exception to this general rule is in the case where a Return of Premium rider
      was purchased with the term life policy . In this situation if you are still
      alive when the term life policy reaches the end of its stated period of coverage
      the policyholder is refunded the premium they have paid to the insurance company
      over the life of the policy . You do pay additional premium costs for this Return
      of Premium provision .
    - Term Life Insurance does not have the option to become paid up , like permanent
      life insurance does . If you pay your policy each monththrough to the end of
      the term , the policy simply ends or takes on a higher cost . There is nothing
      to cash in . Also , you do not have the option to pay term at an increased cost
      for a shorter time period , like you do with permanent insurance . If you quit
      paying on it at any time , the policy ends .

    - That is an excellent question ! One of two things will happen . If the policy
      was paid up long ago , and has remained in effect , then it acts like any other
      policy , and when the insured passes , it pays out . Unfortunately , what happens
      most often is that Parents had a policy on the child , the parent that paid
      the bills passes , the policy does n't get paid , goes into grace period , and
      then lapses , and cancels . All those years of payments go up in smoke . Please
      ensure that your loved ones have a copy , or access to , your finances , sand
      their payment schedules , so that this does n't happen to you . I have had to
      have the conversation about unpaid policies far too often , and each time it
      breaks my heart to see the child realize there is no insurance . Thanks for
      asking !
    - A life insurance policy is paid up when all required annual premiums have been
      paid . If the policy is a `` whole life paid up at age 95 '' contract , the
      policy is paid up at age 95 . It is important to note that the term `` paid
      up '' is often misused . In whole life policies that pay policy dividends ,
      the dividend values are frequently used to buy `` paid up additions '' which
      are paid up , additional amounts of insurance that have cash value and add to
      the base policy . The cash value of paid up additions may be projected , based
      on the current dividend scale , to grow to a point in the future where those
      values may be used to premiums on the base policy . The policy is not paid up
      when the policy owner pays premiums this way .
    - This is a great question and I appreciate the opportunity to offer some answers
      ! Whole Life Insurance has a lot of benefits ! For one it is highly customizable
      in the way it may be funded . It can be set up to be funded in as little as
      11 annual payments , or paid for monthly over the life of the insured up to
      age 100 . Whole Life policies have a Guaranteed cash accumulation feature where
      a guaranteed interest is paid into a cash value portion of the policy , which
      then becomes a liquid asset accessible at the will of the owner of the policy
      . The interest -LRB- as well as dividends in participating policies -RRB- is
      paid into the cash value Tax-FREE . And a policy may be `` over-funded '' up
      to about 300 % , which of course will increase the tax-free interest growth
      rate . In a participating policy where dividends are paid in , the dividends
      may be used to purchase additional insurance . This increases not only the death
      benefit without ever taking another medical exam or even answering questions
      , but also increases the dividends paid ! Whole life insurance does not expire
      . It remains in force -LRB- as long as the premiums are paid up -RRB- until
      the insured dies , the owner decides to surrender the policy -LRB- for the cash
      value -RRB- , or the insured reaches the age of endowment . The age of endowment
      varies with the policy , but may be age 95 , 99 , 100 , or now days may be as
      high as age 121 . When that happens the entire value of the policy is handed
      over to the owner of the policy . Income tax free . When paid , the death benefit
      passes to the beneficiary -LRB- ies -RRB- income tax free . Another option available
      with Whole Life Insurance is the ability to use the cash value and then to take
      loans from the policy death benefit to supplement retirement income ! This can
      be set up to be paid out monthly , quarterly or annually ... and these payments
      are , again , Tax-free ! So to sum up , Whole Life Insurance does not expire
      regardless of the possible declining health of the insured and provides a death
      benefit to beneficiaries that is transferred tax-free . Whole Life grows Cash
      Value , Tax-Free , which is a liquid asset that may be used for any purpose
      the owner wishes , and may be accessed without incurring a taxable event by
      means of a policy loan . With participating policies the cash value can increase
      by means of guaranteed interest and dividends , which may be used to buy additional
      insurance with no medical requirements . The premiums are set at the beginning
      of the policy and are guaranteed not to increase for any reason . And the entire
      premium may be paid in as little as 11 annual payments , spread out over the
      lifetime of the insured , or set up to be paid over a 15 , 20 or 30 year period
      determined by the the owner of the policy . And Whole Life Insurance may be
      used to supplement retirement income as a tax-free cash stream .
    - 'What happens when your term life insurance ends ? What will happen is this
      : you will take out your checkbook , remember what your premium used to be ,
      breathe heavy sigh , and then make your check payable for a much larger amount
      . In my career I have seen renewal premiums literally 10 times the original
      rate . Yes , 10 times . Doesnt always happen , but it does happen . And you
      will not know how high the increase will be until you get your renewal notice
      . They dont tell you in advance . Why would an insurance company slam you on
      the renewal ? Several factors could be involved . One is that they are a little
      bit concerned about their reserves . They need to bulk up . Another could be
      that they feel the credit market is a little bit tight . So they need to store
      up some money in case they cant go out and get enough new money . Perhaps they
      feel the whole block of term business is not profitable . Maybe there is a big
      fat insurance company lurking in the wings ready to buy them , and they consider
      the term business to be a liability . So they will jack up the rates to get
      rid of a lot of policies . -LRB- To tell you the truth , I need to learn a little
      bit more about this last reason myself . Most people keep paying term premiums
      , dont die , and then drop their policies anyway . So the insurance company
      has received a bunch of money without paying any out . Why not keep the renewal
      rates more reasonable to hold onto these customers ? -RRB- But the net result
      of these high renewals is that the only people who hold on to their policies
      are people who really need the coverage , and feel they have no other option
      . They feel that their medical history or lifestyle risks would make them ineligible
      for coverage , or make a new policy too expensive . The fact of the matter ,
      though , is that they may indeed qualify for a better rate elsewhere . They
      should get prequalified and really see what the market has to offer . They may
      very well be surprised . And if they dont get a better deal , then the term
      conversion rider in their policy may be an option . As long as they are not
      over the maximum conversion age , they could lock into permanent rates . And
      they dont have to convert the entire face amount at once : it could be done
      in stages , to better manage cash flow . Thanks for asking . Want to learn more

    - 'A retirement plan really is an extension of a financial plan.There are two
      parts . Your financial planner may be qualified to help you with both as a retirement
      planner or work with a lifestyle planner . The first step is determining what
      you want to do when you retire . How do you define retirement success ? Deciding
      when you will slow down and what you will do with your time - your lifestyle
      can be a challenge . Once you have an idea what retirement success looks like
      for you then your financial planner can determine what it will cost to make
      what you want to happen happen . The next step is to design a plan to make it
      happen . Then take action and follow up . If you have further questions , or
      feel that I could be of assistance , please do not hesitate to contact me .

    - A paid up life insurance policy is one that requires no more premiums for it
      to remain in effect . In essence , you have paid enough premiums that , left
      untouched , your policy will stay in effect for the rest of your life . Some
      people want to quit paying premiums before the policy is paid up , and choose
      to settle for a `` reduced '' paid up amount of insurance . The same thing happens
      , the policy will stay in effect with no further premiums paid . But the face
      amount of the policy will be less than what it was originally .
    - If a life insurance policy is truly `` paid up '' it simply means no further
      premiums are due and it is guaranteed to be that way . Some people use the term
      `` paid up '' incorrectly to describe premium `` offsets '' using dividend values
      to pay required premiums . Such arrangements are not paid up and not guaranteed
      . More on this in the last paragraph . Some whole life policies are designed
      to be paid up at a relatively early duration e.g. Policy Year 20 , Age 65 ,
      etc. . The premiums for these policies are relatively high as a result . In
      comparison , in most cases , whole life policies are designed to have required
      premiums to age 95 or 100 or later . Such policies have relatively low premiums
      and are not paid up until age 95 or 100 . A policy can also be `` paid up ''
      at a lesser value than the death benefit . Whole life policies feature a ``
      reduced paid up '' non forfeiture provision . In the event the policy owner
      wishes to stop paying annual required premiums , the policy owner can ask the
      insurer to reduce the death benefit amount for the policy so that no further
      premiums would need to be paid . It is important to note that policies which
      use policy dividends and/or the cash value of Paid Up Additions to offset the
      required premiums due at some future point are not `` paid up '' . In a low
      interest environment like we have now , dividends are being reduced from what
      was illustrated . Many clients who expected to stop paying premiums and instead
      pay them via the dividend values in their policy can not do so yet since the
      dividend values are not sufficient to offset premiums .
    - 'What happens when your Term life Insurance policy `` runs out '''' or expires
      or lapses is all the same : Nothing . You no longer have any insurance coverage
      . And since Term insurance has no cash value you do n''t get any kind of refund
      or surrender value . The only exception is if you had purchased a `` Return
      of Premium '''' rider with your policy . I that case you most likely will receive
      a portion of the premiums paid in returned to you .'
    - Term Life Insurance Ends when the contract period is over . Term life Insurance
      ends when you havent paid your premium and the reinstatement period is over
      . Term life insurance ends when a death claim occurs while the policy is in
      force . Term life insurance ends and permanent life insurance begins when the
      conversion privilege is exercised on the existing term life insurance policy
      .
    - 'This is a great question that I was just answering last night with another
      client . The first and foremost thing that you should look for is an agent .
      Even though much of the world buys insurance over the phone , a local agent
      can help you determine what types of coverage you want and need and is familiar
      with the local area . Being familiar helps in determining the reconstruction
      cost vs the selling price vs the tax value . All three numbers are usually different
      . Most people do not want to be either under or over insured , and a local agent
      will help with that . The second thing to look for is the company writing the
      policy . You will never know how good your insurance is until you need it .
      When a minor claim happens typically every insurance company will be able and
      willing to pay the claim . It is when the catastrophic occurs that you really
      get what you pay for . Thousands of dollars and many hours can be wasted when
      your insurance company is unwilling to agree with you . This is also another
      reason to have local agent representation . Third and finally is look at what
      other coverages are available and discuss whether or not you want to buy those
      coverages or self insure . Some of my favorite must haves are : replacement
      cost on contents , increased construction costs and replacement cost on the
      home itself , a deductible that you can afford to pay tomorrow if needed , sewer
      back up if you live downhill of anyone , A-rated carrier , and local claims
      personnel . There are many more topics that need to be discussed and reviewed
      which is why my # 1 recommendation on what to look for when buying home insurance
      is a great local agent .'
    - This is the amount of insurance that if you stopped making premium payments
      today and elected to take a paid up policy , you would have that amount of insurance
      for the rest of your life . A 20 pay life policy would be paid up in 20 years
      with no premium due after that time while the insurance is still in force .
      A whole life policy can have a reduced paid up option after enough cash value
      has accumulated in the policy to provide a paid up policy . This table can be
      found in your policy . A good agent can help review your policy with you to
      help you understand your non-forfiture options
    - A Term life insurance policy is one that will have the same premium for a set
      number of the years in the term . Some Term life insurance will guarantee that
      the premium will not go up for the entire term ; other Term life insurance will
      guarantee that the premium can not go up for part of the term . E.g. 30 year
      Term life may be guaranteed not to go up in price for the full 30 years , or
      it can be guaranteed not to go up for 20 of the 30 years and `` hope '' that
      it wo n't go up the last 10 years . Term life insurance does not have any cash
      value . If you quit paying on Term life , it will end after one month .
    - 'You have been operating your business for 6 years without incident which is
      great . This is the first claim -LRB- and hopefully last claim , -RRB- so I
      understand your concern about your premiums increasing next year . I ''m not
      exactly sure what your business does , but knowing what you do would help me
      to further figure out whether or not your premiums would increase because of
      this claim . When re-marketing your account with other insurance companies we
      would need to explain what happened and discuss the likelihood of this happening
      again . Insurerslook at the historical data associated with past claims , current
      trends , andalso consider estimations of future losses to help determinethe
      rates that they use.This is a great question and thereare several things you
      need to consider.When you get a moment , turn to the conditions section of your
      CGL policy . The conditions state what your duties are in the event of occurrence
      , claim , or suit . 1 . Notify company of occurrence a . You must see to it
      that we are notified as soon as practicable of an `` occurrence '''' or an offense
      which may result in a claim . To the extent possible , notice should include
      : -LRB- 1 -RRB- How , when and where the `` occurrence '''' or offense took
      place ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the names and addresses of any injured persons and witnesses
      : and -LRB- 3 -RRB- The nature and location of any injury or damage arising
      out of the `` occurrence '''' or offense . b . If a claim is made or `` suit
      '''' is brought against any insured , you must : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Immediately record
      the specifics of the claim or `` suit '''' and the date received : and -LRB-
      2 -RRB- Notify us as soon as practicable If you read the `` Obligations at Insureds
      Own Cost `` condition it says : `` No insured will , except at the insured ''s
      own cost , voluntarily make a payment , assume any obligation , or incur any
      expense , other than for first aid , without our consent . '''' There are many
      questions that would need to be answered , but if I were you I would put my
      insurance carrier on notice that there has been an incident and let them take
      the reigns . Please contact me if you have any additional questions or concerns
      about this claim . I would be happy to help guide you in the right direction
      . Have a great weekend . Best , Josh DeBoer'
    - Life insurance is about paying money to beneficiaries when the insured person
      dies . Property insurance pays when something happens to your property , health
      insurance pays when something happens to your health , disability insurance
      pays when something happens to your ability to work , and life insurance pays
      if something happens to your life . However , some life insurance policies also
      have cash that can be accessed while you are alive .
    - The major advantage of Term Life Insurance is it 's low cost per thousand dollars
      of coverage . Of course , this price goes up drastically when the term ends
      , so that is only an advantage if you no longer need the policy after the term
      expires . Another advantage of Term insurance is that it usually does ensure
      that you are insurable the rest of your life . If you get a policy that can
      be converted to permanent insurance for a number of years after the policy was
      issued , you can change it to Whole or Universal Life with no health questions
      asked . The price will be high , because it is permanent insurance and will
      be issued at the older age you are when you do the conversion . But that still
      is a major advantage , if you would happen to be diagnosed with a serious illness
      and are unable to get a new policy .
    - You can contact the insurance company to request to borrow funds from the policy
      -LRB- your company 's policyholder services department should be able to handle
      it - they may request you complete a form for written documentation purposes
      -RRB- . The maximum amount you can borrow is up to the current surrender or
      loan value cited in the policy at the time you want to borrow from the cash
      value . Keep in mind , when you borrow money from the cash value , you are creating
      a loan against the policy -LRB- the funds are expected to be paid back and ,
      much like you do when borrowing from a bank , an interest rate is being charged
      on the borrowed monies -RRB- . If the insured dies with an outstanding loan
      , the carrier will deduct the outstanding amount and any interest charges from
      the death benefit and give the difference to the beneficiary . I would recommend
      consulting with your agent before borrowing from the cash value to find out
      what will happen when you create a loan against the policy and what you 're
      responsible for . I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact
      me for help or if you have any other questions . Thanks very much .
    - First let me ask you if you purchased temporary Term coverage , or permanent
      , Whole Life coverage ? If it is Term , then , so long as you continue to pay
      the premium , it will last for the period you contracted for , as level term
      , and then the rates will rise considerably . 97 % of folks let their Term policy
      lapse before that ever happens . I always recommend Whole Life , because it
      last a lifetime , if you pay the premiums , and those premiums NEVER increase
      , and also it builds up cash value which you can borrow against , or take out
      tax free to pay for college , retirement , or a new home . While more $ at first
      , eventually it actually becomes less expensive than term , as its built up
      value can pay the premiums for you . A quality company can provide you with
      a variety of choices . Call me , Gary Lane , Agent , New York Life , 949 797 2424

    - I do not see very many disadvantages to renters insurance . Lets look at the
      coverage renters insurance provides , and then we can talk about what it does
      not cover . Renters insurance is designed to cover your personal property ,
      protect you if you are sued , and pay medical bills if someone is injured on
      your property . Most people get upset when their insurance does not cover something
      . Sometimes people file claims to pay their landlord for clean up their deposit
      did not cover -LRB- this is not covered -RRB- . Some agents use renters insurance
      as an ad on coverage and they choose how much coverage without consulting your
      need . If you have renters insurance and only have $ 10k of coverage when you
      needed more you will not be paid more than the $ 10k A common deductible on
      renters insurance policies is $ 500 , and often smaller theft claims do not
      exceed the deductible . I see this a lot in personal items stolen out of vehicles
      . I think the advantages of having renters insurance far out way not having

    - 'What ''s the importance of Renters Insurance ? If you ''re renting a house
      , condo , or an apartment , the last thing you ''re thinking about is renters
      insurance . Since you do n''t own the building , the landlord is covered , and
      you do n''t value your personal belongings to really add up , what ''s the point
      ? What would you do if : The building or home catches fire and all your personal
      contents are destroyed . Now , all your belongings are gone and you do n''t
      have a place to sleep . Your home or apartment is burglarized ; you ''ve lost
      your laptop , mobile phone , entertainment system and flat screen TV . How about
      your more modern technology items such as a Tablet , iPhone , iPod etc. . .
      A visitor or service provider trips and falls in your home or apartment and
      decides to sue you for his injuries . Whether or not it is your fault , a renter
      must replace his or her personal items . If there is a law suit , the renter
      will have to seek a defense attorney even if there is clearly no fault . How
      much would it cost to replace your clothes , laptop , and furniture . Here are
      some reasons to have renters insurance : BURGLARY . You may think your apartment
      is `` secure '''' ! Rental units are prime targets for theft and burglars are
      getting smarter about how to break into apartments and rental homes ; most of
      them do not have a security system and are not insured . FIRE OR SMOKE DAMAGE
      . The landlord ''s insurance wo n''t replace your furniture and personal belongings
      . Renters insurance will cover items damaged by fire , smoke , and other situations
      . WATER DAMAGE . Renters insurance may cover items caused by water damage .
      Additional living expenses . If your unit is damaged by water or fire , you
      ''ll likely need to find another place to live whether short or long term .
      Most policies include coverage for hotel expenses or assistance to find an alternate
      rental unit if you ca n''t live in your rental unit . LIABILITY INSURANCE .
      Renters insurance can cover injury to another person on your property . It can
      also include medical payments coverage that pays for expenses of guests . Inexpensive
      . Renters insurance is very inexpensive if not relatively cheap ! Higher deductibles
      can decrease the cost of insurance . Renters insurance is a must if not required
      by your landlord and can save you thousands of dollars , all for a lot less

    - 'If your lease agreement has a clause requiring Renters Insurance , yes , the
      Landlord may enforce the clause thereby forcing you to buy Renters Insurance
      or being in breach of the contract . Renters Insurance is a valuable coverage
      ; many renters simply deny the issue due to the small cost of coverage . In
      our many years in business , we have seen a variety of claims ; the following
      is just a short synopsis of the necessary protection . Renters Insurance includes
      Personal Property Coverage and Personal Liability Insurance . Liability Insurance
      being the more important coverage as this is where a legal action against the
      renter could cause undue hardship . If a fire or water damage claim is caused
      by the renter , the renter would be negligent and therefore liable for the damage
      caused . Although the property may be insured , the insurance carrier of the
      Landlord would subrogate and may bring legal action against the tenant . Personal
      Property coverage would provide protection against theft , fire and water damage
      to the contents of the renter . The Landlord ''s insurance does not cover the
      tenant ''s property in any way ; neither does it allow for legal protection
      of the tenant . Should a tenant not be interested in this valuable protection
      , we recommend purchasing the minimum available personal property coverage with
      the minimum liability protection of $ 100,000 . This coverage would cost in
      the range of $ 100 - $ 300 per year depending on the region of the country and
      the specific insurance carrier underwriting the risk . You may obtain a Renters

    - 'Yes , Yes & Yes !!! Although Renters Insurance is designed to protect the Personal
      Belongings of the Renter , the policy also includes Personal Liability Coverage
      . There have been endless numbers of cases in Small Claims Court where there
      are issues between Landlords and Renters following damage to rental units .
      With the presence of a Renters Insurance Policy , the insurance company will
      investigate the claim and find if in fact the renter ''s negligence caused the
      loss ; if so , the damage repairs will be covered by the tenant ''s personal
      liability section of the Renters Insurance Policy . In some States , the Renters
      Insurance Policy is a requirement under the conditions of the standard rental
      agreement ; however , it is prudent of Landlords to require Renters Insurance
      . As a rhetorical question : ` Would you wish to rent your property to a tenant
      not concerned with insuring their own belongings ? '' Renters Insurance is very
      inexpensive and contrary to common belief , you do n''t have to speak to a salesperson
      to obtain a quote and buy the insurance . In many States , the minimum coverage
      is $ 10,000 or $ 15,000 of Personal Property and the policy automatically comes
      with $ 100,000 of Personal Liability . Depending on your selected deductible
      , the premium may be as low as $ 100 per year . If you are responsibly cautious
      only about the liability issue , we would recommend selecting the highest deductible
      since this will generate the lowest premium ; the deductible does n''t apply
      to the liability section . For an online free quote and online platform to buy

    - Renters insurance protects the landlord in the sense that it can provide extra
      liability protection A renters policy is taken out by the renter to cover the
      renters possessions . It does not cover the dwelling or items owned by the landlord
      . If however a renter is negligent and someone is injured on the property ,
      the renters insurance will provide protection from lawsuit .
    - When you rent an apartment , you have the option to buy renters insurance .
      These policies protect your belongings while you live in the rental property
      . It is up to your whether you want to buy one of these policies . This insurance
      isnt needed to rent an apartment . There is no government law that forces you
      to buy renters insurance before you can rent an apartment . Its not like driving
      a car , which requires car insurance . If you want to rent an apartment without
      insurance , you are free to do so . It also doesnt matter to your landlord whether
      or not you have renters insurance . A renters policy doesnt cover damage to
      your apartment building or to your landlords property . Your landlord will protect
      himself with his own insurance policy . Since you dont cover your landlord at
      all with renters insurance , he wont ask you to buy it before renting out the
      apartment . While renters insurance is not a requirement , it is often a good
      idea . If your apartment is robbed or destroyed in an accident , you will need
      to replace all your belongings on your own . In addition , if someone gets hurt
      in your home , you as the renter are liable . The injured person could sue you
      and force a costly settlement . Renters insurance covers you in both these costly
      situations . When you own one of these policies , you protect yourself from
      the financial risks of owning an apartment .
    - The difference between Renter 's Insurance , Condo Owner 's Insurance & even
      Homeowner 's lies in the insurable interest . A renter 's policy is going to
      cover personal property -LRB- contents -RRB- , but not any building coverage
      ... since the renter does not own the building , they do not typically have
      an insurable interest . However , in some cases , there have been leases that
      require the tenant to pay for the insurance and taxes - these are called triple
      net leases . The renter in these cases may have to purchase coverage for the
      building rented -LRB- usually a home -RRB- . Condos almost always have a condo
      association . The condo association covenants determine how the condo should
      be covered . Some associations only cover the exterior walls , leaving the condo
      owner to cover everything attached to the building including what 's between
      the drywall/sheetrock & exterior . Some associations cover everything up to
      the drywall/sheetrock , while others even include anything attached to the drywall/sheetrock
      including cabinets , etc. . On occasion , the condo association can assess a
      property deductible to each individual condo for $ 10,000 ; in which case you
      would want to make sure that amount is added to the your policy . In each case
      , whether renter 's insurance or condo insurance , make sure you obtain the
      lease or covenants and make sure you do n't have any `` holes '' in your coverage
      !
    - 'A Landlord can require Renters Insurance in any State as a condition of the
      Lease Agreement . Renters Insurance is an increasingly more valuable commodity
      for both home owners and renters in a very litigious society . Renters Insurance
      provides the Landlord peace of mind in the event a claim occurs as the result
      of the tenant ''s negligence ; the home owner will not be negatively impacted
      by their insurance . Many Landlords require the Tenant to list the Landlord
      as an ` Additional Insured '' on the Renters Insurance Policy this will insure
      the Landlord receives a copy of all correspondence including cancellation notices
      and renewal notices . Renters Insurance provides coverage for the tenant ''s
      Personal Property as well as offering Personal Liability coverage which is the
      specific section in the interest of the Landlord . Without this important coverage
      , legal actions are more damaging and cumbersome for all parties concerned .
      There are a few States that have required all tenants in the State to purchase
      Renters Insurance and the requirement is a compulsory section of the Standard
      Lease Agreement which is signed by both the Landlords and Tenants . States have
      taken this action due to an overwhelming load of small claims cases burdening
      the Court System . Renters Insurance is an inexpensive form of security which
      all responsible tenants should wish to have ; in many localities , a policy
      can be purchased for as little as $ 8.00 per month . For a Renters Insurance
      quote , there is an available link to obtain your quote and purchase the policy
      online : WEBSITELINK In order to produce the lowest rate , you will need to
      select the minimum amount of Personal Property Coverage available to cover all
      your possessions , select the minimum required Personal Liability Limit , and
      select the maximum available Deductible . The deductible does n''t apply to
      the Personal Liability section , so if this is the only reason that you are
      buying the policy , the maximum deductible should be purchased to obtain the
      lowest premium .'
    - As of this date and to the best of my knowledge renters insurance is not required
      in any state . A landlord may through the rental agreement require any tenant
      to carry renters insurance . Renters insurance is typically very low cost and
      can provide protection when you need it . With renters insurance you not only
      cover your personal property but also adds liability coverage in the event that
      someone is hurt while at your residence .
    - Renters Insurance in the US is an outgrowth of the regular Homeowners Insurance
      policies that have been in use in many states since the mid 20th Century . In
      fact for many companies the forms in use continue to be variations -LRB- with
      appropriate state approvals -RRB- of forms developed by the Insurance Service
      Office , ISO . The Insurance Service Office is not alone in developing contractual
      homeowners and subsequently renters policy forms in use in the various states
      . There are other product development groups and larger companies often develop
      their own product offerings . With all that said , there are some common elements
      to homeowner and renters policy and by far the use of annual -LRB- 12 month
      terms predominates -RRB- . Decades ago there were companies using forms that
      lasted as much as three years for homeowners , but the reality of getting appropriate
      approvals from the regulators , responding to loss results and getting mortgage
      companies to accept the policies has all led to a fairly standardized approach
      in the US that homeowners and renters policies are primarily annual contracts
      . But do n't throw away all your old policies when you get to the end of a year
      if you are all aware of an event that might give rise to coverage during that
      time period . For example suppose during the term of your renters policy your
      dog bit a neighbor . That occurrence then would be associated with the payment
      of loss for the infliction of bodily injury even though the damage is only assessed
      completely for years to come . Her is why I mention dog bites . In many states
      you have absolute liability for your dog 's aggression . And , dogs who maul
      a victim are often attacking children -LRB- easier prey to the dog -RRB- and
      the damages are usually to the child 's head . Therefore as they age there can
      be a need for repeated surgeries to address the scaring . Since the renters
      policy is typically an occurrence policy , the policy which will respond is
      not the current insurer several years out , but the insurer at the time of the
      event or '' occurrence ''
    - NO they can not force you to have renters insurance but they can choose to not
      rent to you if you do not get renters insurance . Most renters policies are
      on average $ 100 a year depending on your state that is with 40K worth of coverage
      on your contents and 100K in liability coverage . It is well worth the cost
      and in many cases if you bundle it with your auto insurance it lowers your auto
      insurance I have seen in many cases it lowered your auto insurance 10 a month
      and the renters insurance is less then 10 a month so this puts you ahead . Contact
      a local independent agent and they can help you muddle through what works best
      for you
    - Rates for renters insurance depend upon a few factors . Where your apartment
      is located , how much personal property you are insuring and what liability
      rates you requested . For example , in Michigan , where I live I can get renters
      insurance covering $ 30,000 of personal property with $ 300,000 in liability
      coverage for about $ 200/year . The point is renters insurance is very affordable
      . I hope this helps .
    - Great question ! Anyone who will be putting their belongings into a home owned
      by someone else , and who does n't have the money to replace it all should it
      be stolen or destroyed needs renters insurance . It is a common mistake to believe
      that the landlords insurance covers you , but it only covers what they stand
      to lose , not you . Renters insurance is relatively inexpensive , and can really
      be a blessing if your home is damaged , or you are robbed . If you would like
      help , please feel free to contact me . Thanks for asking !
    - 'Always . And the landlord should request evidence of the existence of the renters
      insurance . Reason number one : Under the personal liability coverage of a renters
      policy the carrier agrees to pay the sums the insured is legally liable for
      as a result of bodily injury or property damage . What type of occurrencescould
      be involved ? A guest in the renter ''s apartment slips on a wet bathroom floor
      , falls , and is injured . This is bodily injury . The tenant leaves a pan of
      oil on the stove unattended and a fire results damaging the building . This
      is property damage . Reason number two : Unless legally liable , the landlord
      is not responsible for the tenant ''s business or personal property -LRB- for
      things like fire , theft , mysterious disappearance , etc -RRB- The tenant should
      cover their own property with insurance like a renters policy .'
    - A landlord at their discretion can require renters insurance as part of the
      rental agreement . If you do not wish to purchase renters insurance you have
      the right to look for housing from a landlord who does not have this requirement
      . The landlord is not breaking any laws by making renters insurance a requirement
      of the rental agreement .
    - A renters policy is essentially a homeowners policy that does not cover the
      structure . It has two basic coverages , Property Coverage which is designed
      to make you `` whole '' -LRB- within the definitions of the policy -RRB- should
      you have a `` covered loss '' and suffer economic loss in excess of the deductibleas
      a result . It also covers personal liability for bodily injury or property damage
      that the renter is liable for by law .
    - Renters insurance does indeed cover your personal property . However , there
      are many other components of a renter 's policy . For example , in the event
      of a covered claim -LRB- fire or tornado are two common ones -RRB- , your living
      expenses away from your house or apartment will be covered -LRB- subject to
      policy limits -RRB- . So , semantically , they are nearly the same , but there
      are differences in the specific benefits .
    - 'The definition of `` good '''' varies from person to person and business to
      business . However , here are some of the aspects of a health insurance policy
      I advise my clients to be aware of and comfortable with : 1 -RRB- Are the doctors
      , hospitals and pharmacies you want to use in-network providers with the health
      insurance plan you are considering ? 2 -RRB- What would your coverage be -LRB-
      if any -RRB- if you want to use a health care provider who is not an in-network
      provider with the health insurance plan you are considering ? 3 -RRB- What is
      the pharmacy benefit under the health plan you are considering ? And , if you
      have specific prescription drug needs are they covered under the health insurance
      plan ''s prescription formulary and to what extent are they covered -LRB- copays
      , co-insurance , deductible & co-insurance -RRB- ? 4 -RRB- Does the health insurance
      plan allow its members to go directly to specialists such as cardiologists or
      does it require that you are referred to a specialist by your primary care physician
      first ? 5 -RRB- If you travel regularly outside of your home area -LRB- to other
      states or outside the USA -RRB- does the health plan provide for coverage outside
      of your home service area in the event you need non-emergency care ? 6 -RRB-
      Is the health insurance company you are considering a well established national
      or regional health insurance carrier with strong finances or is it one of the
      new , experimental Co-Op health plans recently established under the provisions
      of ObamaCare ? 7 -RRB- Does the overall value proposition of the health insurance
      plan you are considering meet your current and anticipated needs ? In other
      words , does its monthly premium , coverage levels and provider network really
      work for you .'

    - Most insurance companies do not surcharge for animals . Instead they exclude
      certain breeds , restrict payment on others and/or decline the property completely
      . Dog bites are a major problem for insurance companies and they are more likely
      to deny coverage and exclude coverage for certain breeds should you purchase
      the animal following the start of the policy .
    - Yes it does . You have liability coverage on your Renter 's policy . It usually
      comes with $ 100,000 of coverge which would cover a dogbite . This is why the
      agent will ask you if you own adog and what kind . Many companies will not insure
      you if you own certain breeds such as Pitbulls or Rottweilers .
    - Great question . While pitbulls are great dogs for the most part insurance companies
      tend not to like to insure them . You will have a very hard time to get to cover
      you dog in your home insurance policy . Most insurance companies have a list
      of dogs they will not insure and pitbulls are on almost all of them .
    - 'That is going to depend on the insurance carrier . Each carrier maintains it
      ''s own list of animals that it considers to be higher risk . Some of the dog
      breeds that tend to be on many of the lists are : pitbulls , german shepards
      , anddobermans to name just a few . Contact your local agent to discuss the
      effect that certain dog breeds mayhave on your homeowners insurance coverage
      and pricing .'
    - Pitbulls are an excluded breed under many homeowners and renters policies .
      There are companies out there though that will had dog liability as a separate
      policy as long as you and the dog meet the carrier 's expectations for coverage
      . Contact a local agent to find out more about coverage availability and pricing
      within your geographic location .
    - It is possible that pitbulls may be an excluded breed under the terms and conditions
      of your policy . The best way to determine that , of course , is to check with
      your insrance professional . Some companies who limit breeds may also allow
      them provided that you can show proof of the dog successfully compleeting a
      comprehensive training program .
    - Why would you buy whole life ? Here 's why I bought it . I wanted lifetime coverage
      as I do n't think I would die in 10,20 or 30 years . I was young enough to purchase
      a fair amount of coverage because I was in good health and purchased it at a
      locked in price . A price that they ca n't come back and raise on me . The WL
      offered reasonable safe growth , certainty that allowed me to take more risk
      with my other investment choices . My whole life became `` if I screw everything
      else up , this wo n't let me down . '' My safety net . After 20 plus years of
      ownership , whole life has done what it promised me , been there when I needed
      it and did n't go backwards in 2008 when ten years returns were wiped off my
      mutual fund accounts and my home value dropped 40 % . My boring steady unexciting
      whole life remained faithful to me . Now in my 50 's as a type II diabetic who
      just had his heart rebooted -LRB- cardioversion -RRB- because of A FIB , I really
      really appreciate the fact I `` OWN '' my policy . They ca n't raise the price
      , they ca n't end it . I did n't rent it , I OWN it . Maybe some readers will
      get how important that is . For all the financial gurus who may have said this
      was a bad idea , I have to ask why are so many people in their 60 's seeking
      new insurance ? Could it be they listened to the wrong people when they were
      younger and healthier ? There are a ton of reasons to own whole life , there
      is . All I can say is it is the most boring product you can buy . It will do
      what it 's supposed to , without fanfare or up and down excitement . It 's the
      most boring financial product you can `` OWN '' . I hope that makes sense to
      some who read these posts .
    - Most homeowners policies have an annual adjustment for the increased costs of
      construction . This raises the limits in the policy which also raises the premium
      . With each passing year the home grows older and that also affects the premium
      . Companies often reward customers who do not have claims and those discounts
      can have a substantial effect on your premium . Occasionally companies will
      file for and receive from the state insurance commissioner permission to raise
      the rates in a specific area due to losses that exceed the premiums received
      .
    - It is possible , depending on your carrier . However , items like trampolines
      , swimming pools , swing sets etc , even if they do n't raise your homeowners
      insurance rate , certainly raise your liability exposure . For that reason ,
      it is important to review the amount of liability protection your policy provides
      . Do you have enough if someopne got hurt and you were sued ? Be sure to have
      thecoverage that you need by increasing the liability coverage in your Homeowners
      policy and look into buying extra coverage in a Personal Umbrella Liability
      Policy . These begin coverage at $ 1,000,000 and can be increased as needed
      .
    - 'Years ago , it was n''t all that uncommon to see a $ 100 deductible . Those
      days are gone . Today , our standard deductible is $ 500 but I sell more deductibles
      of $ 1.000 and $ 2,500 . There ''s a reason for this . In the past , say around
      25 years ago , a homeowners policy was very basic and really only covered your
      home and contents with a few other ancillary coverages . The consumer was different
      , also . They usually only filed a claim for something big like a fire or tornado
      . About 20 years ago or so , insurance companies thought it would be a good
      idea to add more coverages for smaller things like refrigerated food and others
      . Then , a strange thing happened : People started claiming these things . You
      see , big claims like fires are very infrequent and the rates were built around
      these rarely occurring , big losses . They were n''t prepared for the more frequent
      small losses . Therefore , a $ 100 deductible on a total loss does n''t add
      much to the claim . However , insurance companies began seeing a lot of smaller
      claims and , now , that $ 100 deductible made it beneficial to the consumer
      to claim that $ 400 loss . In fact , they became so frequent that it was really
      hurting the insurance companies profitability . Every claim requires people
      to process it , adjust it , and make a payment . Insurance companies were seeing
      these costs skyrocket and they had no choice but to raise premiums to offset
      these costs . They finally reached a point where they had to discourage all
      these small losses . The way they did it ? they made the $ 100 and $ 250 deductible
      options a lot more expensive . So now , a $ 500 deductible is pretty standard
      , with higher deductibles saving quite a bit off the premiums . What does this
      mean for you ? First , realize that your homeowners policy was designed to cover
      the catastrophic losses , not the small things that happen more often . In Michigan
      , if you have 3 claims in a 3 year period that are n''t weather-related , your
      company can cancel your policy . This will leave you in a spot where you may
      have to pay 3 or 4 times the premium your used to until you ''re eligible again
      . A homeowners policy is not a maintenance contract . As a homeowner , things
      are going to happen and the responsibility for maintaining your home is yours
      . My advice is this : Take care of your home and pay for the small things and
      take a higher deductible . You ''ll probably save more before you have claim
      than the difference in the deductible . In the long run , you ''ll be protected

      . A company headquartered in White Plains , NY and established in 1967 . It
      is a financially separate entity from the Gerber Products Company , with the
      same mission - `` help parents raise happy , healthy children '' . Gerber life
      insurance offers both term life insurance and whole life insurance . They even
      have signature products that include term or whole life . The Gerber Life Insurance
      Company currently has a single A rating from A.M. Best , which is consider `
      Excellent ' . A.M. Best provides impartial reporting by rating insurance company
      management , integrity , and financial stability .
    - That is a great question ! There are a couple of reasons why a whole life policy
      makes sense . One would be if it is purchased for a young child . The price
      is locked in at that low rate for their entire life , and many companies will
      offer the opportunity to increase that coverage without any questions . The
      second is that the policy does n't end , so there is no way that you can outlive
      it . Many senior citizens purchase the policy advertised on TV by the large
      senior citizen advocate company , only to find that it ends when they turn 80
      . Given that the average life expectancy is 84 for women and 82 for men , for
      many that is a terrible surprise to find that the policy ends , and that getting
      another one is too expensive , or not available due to their health issues .
      The third is that no matter how badly your health declines , you have insurance
      that ca n't drop you , or raise your rates . When your term policy ends , and
      youwant to get another one , your age and health issues are re-evaluated when
      determining eligibility and price . Please feel free to contact me if you would
      like to discuss this further . Thanks for asking !
    - Why invest in whole life insurance ? Well it is one of the few insurance products
      that you actually control , not the insurance carrier . That is a big reason
      why whole life insurance is expensive compared to other life products . The
      insurance company bears the risk of the contract as they can not alter or change
      the terms of the contract , they can not raise the price of the policy in later
      years and must receive the policy owners permission to do anything to the policy
      . What a whole life offers is a decent return for the safety it provides the
      policy holder . There is very little investment risk to a whole life policy
      compared to other places where a person can put money . This also is reflected
      in the return . If you had money invested in 2008 you learned first hand about
      investment risk . That said , while the rest of my investments were losing 40
      % my whole life gained value . You ca n't go backwards with a whole life which
      makes it a good part of anybody 's planning . I call whole life the most boring
      investment a person can make . Why ? it does what it says it will do .
    - Do you buy running shoes for a marathon form Wal-Mart ???? Do you buy a 4 cylinder
      truck to pull a trailer that really demands a V8 ? My point is , `` WHO CARES
      who has the cheapest '' . Yes , there is a way to assess apples to apples when
      buying home insurance . Red vs. green apples . There are always some differences
      in policies . However , in my state , there is a vast difference in plans offered
      . You are buying something to guard your finances in the event of the loss of
      your home , valuables , or retirement -LRB- that 's called Liability Coverage
      folks -RRB- . BUY THE MOST you can reasonably afford . I did a quote once and
      for curiosity I raised our `` in house standard amount of liability '' form
      300K to 500K -LRB- the next step up for that carrier -RRB- ... What did I see
      ???? A ONE DOLLAR difference ... Yes ... ONE dollar . $ 200,000 more in coverage
      for a buck . That does n't happen for everyone and every carrier . Yet it 's
      almost always less than $ 10 a month . WOW ... 200K more for $ 10 a month ...
      . You 'll pay the price if you buy on price . - gravy
    - Each renewal of your auto insurance insurance policy your carrier if they wish
      may raise your auto insurance premium . A notice of the increase in rates is
      typically sent at least thirty days before the policy comes up for renewal .
      Almost all auto insurance policies are active for a six month or one year term
      .
    - Most often the lender requires ` hazard insurance ' premiums be included in
      the escrow account . The borrower may request the insurance be added to an existing
      escrow account or one set up for the insurance premium but the untimate decision
      is up to the lender . Normally when establing escrow , the borrower pays the
      first year premium at closing and the escrow provider includes an additional
      monthly amount in the mortgage payments for the next 11 or 12 months so there
      is enough in the escrow account available to pay the renewal premium . What
      is critical here is for the borrower to keep their insurance carrier informed
      of any change in the lender 's or escrow servicing entity 's name , address
      , or account reference number . The borrower should also let the lender know
      of any changes to the insurance contract which raise or lower the premium .
      This would include an upcoming renewal premium that may be significantly higher
      -LRB- for various reasons -RRB- than the expiring premium . Many lenders want
      policies and documents to go to one address and bills to another -LRB- possibly
      the escrow servicing entity . -RRB- All borrowers must be cognizant of these
      items and proactive in notifying all interested parties . The last thing a borrower
      want is for their ` homeowners policy ' to be cancelled for non-payment because
      the escrow entity did n't receive the renewal bill so they could pay the renewal
      premium . Whenever you receive anything from an insurance company you have a
      policy with , make sure you understand what it is and take action immediately
      . In the event the policy is cancelled -LRB- for any reason or event -RRB- the
      lender will no doubt secure ` force placed ' hazard insurance to protect their
      interest -LRB- and not that of the borrower . -RRB- A forced placed policy will
      definitely be a lot more expensive premium-wise and a lot more restrictive coverage-wise
      . Not a good situation to be in and usually totally avoidable . So if a borrower
      enters this type of situation , they had better ` stay on top of it ' or suffer
      the consequences .
    - Term life insurance is life insurance that is active only for a set period of
      time . Typically term life insurance will be active for 10 , 20 , or 30 years
      . Term life insurance policies typically do not accumulate a cash value . Whole
      life insurance is permanent insurance . It typically will not expire as long
      as premium payments are made as required . A whole life policy also will normally
      accumulate cash value over it 's existence which could be borrowed from or will
      in most cases raise the death benefit .
    - Health Insurance , like all forms of insurance , is based on a number of calculations
      that associated the benefit received with risk taken by the insurer . When you
      look at a state like California there are many variable factors that go into
      pricing an insurance product ; age of the insured , current health status ,
      smoker or non smoker , current profession , current address , who will be covered
      under the policy , etc. . California has one of the highest cost of living indexes
      around so as that is factored into pricing an insurance product , it affects
      the bottom line . To help ease the cost of health insurance here you can look
      at things like -LRB- 1 -RRB- raising your deductible -LRB- 2 -RRB- lowering
      the amount of co payment you want insurance to cover and -LRB- 3 -RRB- reducing
      the amount of benefits associated with your policy .
    - People would buy term life insurance to cover a temporary need . E.g. Most people
      need more coverage while raising children . Term insurance costs less than permanent
      , and there will not be a need for that much coverage after the children are
      grown . So for that purpose , 20 to 30 year Term works well . Some loan companies
      require term insurance to protect them if the borrower should pass away . Term
      insurance is well suited to temporary needs .
    - 'This calculator can help you determine how much life insurance you need with
      one child : WEBSITELINK It allows you to put in the age of the child , along
      with other factors , to give you a suggested amount of life insurance . Or you
      can estimate what it would cost to raise your child to adulthood , including
      inflation , and determine how much income would be lost if the insured person
      were to pass . Then replace that lost income with life insurance .'

      . It is recommended to secure a long term care expert to review the policy benefits
      and how the work
    - 'Maybe one should not get long-term care insurance . Let ''s start there . If
      an individual or a family has a sizeable estate that either is liquid or can
      be liquidated and be made readily available to pay for the cost of long-term
      care , maybe long-term care is n''t needed . If , on the other extreme , you
      have a very small estate comprised of no real estate and very little personal
      property of any worth and will rely almost entirely on Social Security in retirement
      , you ca n''t afford long-term care premiums , now or in the future . You will
      have to have a plan , however , in case you do need long-term care . A family
      discussion around the topic should be scheduled so that those that might become
      either temporary or permanent caregivers are fully apprised of the responsibilities
      and sacrifices that may have to be made . Medicaid qualification should be fully
      investigated and the benefits and limitations understood . People buy long-term
      care for roughly the same reason they buy life insurance . One buys life insurance
      because they care about the financial security of those that are left behind
      . One buys long-term care insurancebecause they care about those that might
      have to take care of them if they ca n''t take care of themselves . Long-term
      care costs are not covered by conventional health insurance , Medicare , and
      most Medicare supplement insurance . They can be very expensive , especially
      ifthe elderly person lives a long-period of time in a state of incapacity .
      Caregivers will be spouses and adult children are likely to be caregivers whether
      one owns long-term care insurance or not . Long-term care insurance is for caregivers
      . It gives them choices about the quality of care that can be afforded and whether
      they can be relieved of some of the responsibility for caregiving . Many elderly
      spouses of those that ca n''t take care of themselves become disabled themselves
      because of the emotional and psychological energy expended in caregiving . Adult
      children sometimes get caught in a conflict over eldercare and parenting growing
      children . Long-term care insurance provides income-tax-free money to hire trained
      individuals to care for loved ones . Ultimately , it allows the insured to die
      with dignity and peace . Getting back to the wealthy that do n''t need to buy
      long-term care insurance , guess what ? Many wealthy couples and individuals
      do . They understand leverage : paying smaller dollars now for larger dollars
      later , if needed . They also understand that in many situations , premiums
      for long-term care may be tax-deductible . What about the middle class ? They
      would have to design their coverage to help offset the cost of long-term care
      . No matter how much one spends , no long-term care insurance policy can guarantee
      to cover all possible long-term care expenses . But , the average claim is about
      24 - 26 months . Buying a long-term care policy with a pool of money sufficient
      to cover at least part of those costs would be prudent . Is buying a basic plan
      for long-term care that would pay only half of one ''s long-term care costs
      be a bad deal ? I do n''t think anyone that ''s paying $ 400/day for facility
      care and being reimbursed for $ 200/day would find that of no value .'
    - 'A better question would be `` Who Should n''t Buy Long-term Care Insurance
      '''' ? Thats simpler to answer . The following people should NOT buy long term
      care insurance : 1 . Those that can not afford the premium on even a base policy
      . 2 . Those that have virtually no assets to pass on to the next generationand
      will need every available dollar saved for retirement . 3 . Those that will
      have to work until they die for lack of savings and insufficient Social Security
      payments or private pension . 4 . Those that can not medically qualify . 5 .
      Those that are already unable to perform regular daily activities of living
      without assistance . People in those conditions may qualify for the payment
      of long-term care through Medicaid -LRB- MediCal in California -RRB- if they
      come to a point in their life where they need care and ca n''t afford it . If
      the above conditions describe you in any way , you should be sitting down with
      your adult children or closest relatives and coming up with a plan of action
      should you be unable to take care of yourself . Everyone else should consider
      buying some long-term care insurance through an agent or agency that either
      specializes or has a specialist that is experienced in handling long-term care
      insurance casework . Having some amount of insurance is better than having none
      . When one qualifies to receive payments from the insurance company for long-term
      care , they are usually near the end of their life . The average long-term care
      claim is approximately 2 - 2.5 years . For those that need care longer than
      that , virtually all but the most unusual claims are paid out after 5 years
      . Families with a history of late-life mental illness -LRB- dementia or Alzheimers
      -RRB- should consider buying a larger pool of money than others , if they can
      afford it . It is in the best interest of the adult children to help out with
      long-term care premium payments if the elderly parents can not afford to pay
      all of the costs . Long-term care is an emotional , psychological , sociological
      , and family problem as much as it is financial . For the dignity of those who
      need care and the people or person most likely to be the caregiver , there needs
      to be a plan of action determined and long-term care insurance should be a part
      of that plan if it can be afforded and the person is medically qualified . Long-term
      care insurance is best purchased when young . Premiums can and will go up during
      the life of the policy if all the bells and whistles are included in the design
      of the coverage . But , those increases will seem like pocket-change if one
      needs long-term care . $ 80,000 per year is not unusual for facility care today
      . 24/7 home care can exceed $ 20,000 per month ! With family help , home care
      costs can be kept down . But , if facility care is required , there ''s not
      much that can be done about avoiding high costs . Long-term care costs vary
      by place . The left - and right-hand coasts are the most expensive . Relocation
      may be necessary to get affordable care in a quality facility .'
    - 'Short answer : About 8 % Long answer : It ''s hard to say exactly how many
      people own some type of policy that covers paying the costs of long term care
      - should one qualify for it - because there are many types of insurance policies
      that are not just `` stand-alone '''' long-term care policies , but plans of
      insurance that include being able to use a percentage of other plan benefits
      for paying long-term care costs :1 . Stand-alone long-term care insurance covers
      only long-term care costs . It has no cash value . When a policy owner dies
      , coverage either lapses or stops paying benefits . It is not transferable .
      It can not be bought or sold on a secondary market . This type of long-term
      care insurance is sometimes referred to as `` traditional '''' long-term care
      insurance , as well . It is the type of coverage that is most often associated
      with the `` percentage of Americans that own their own long-term care insurance
      '''' .2 . Hybrid long-term care contracts consist of having long-term coverage
      and a life insurance policy that guarantees to at least return the full premium
      paid into the policy to the insured ''s designated beneficiary . Usually , these
      are single-premium contracts , but some have options to also pay over a specified
      period of time , such as 5 - or 10-years .3 . Linked life + long-term care policies
      are basically a traditional permanent life insurance contract -LRB- Whole Life
      or Universal Life , including the Variable or Indexed type -RRB- . If a person
      qualifies for long-term care and they have the long-term care rider on their
      life policy , they may apply to the insurance company to advance or accelerate
      the face value of the policy -LRB- death benefit -RRB- to pay for the costs
      of care . There are various limitations on how much can be advanced at a time
      . If the face value of the life contract is completely advanced for long-term
      care , there is usually a residual death benefit of $ 5,000 - $ 10,000.4 . The
      latest addition to life insurance product lines are policies offering `` living
      benefits '''' , one of which is very similar to the linked-life policy . In
      fact , the only difference is that a medical professional has to state in writing
      that the insured is not likely to recover from the condition that qualifies
      for long-term care benefits . -LRB- True long-term care insurance does not require
      that . -RRB- This type of living benefit is most often referred to as `` chronic
      care '''' or `` extended care '''' . Annuities may also have special considerations
      for paying out portions of the account value for long-term care costs.The point
      is , people who own life insurance or annuity contracts with long-term care
      accommodations are not typically included in with the 8 % that own traditional
      long-term care . So , the real percentage of those that have made some type
      of insurance purchase to offset long-term care costs is greater than 8 % . I
      doubt , however , that the total percentage of Americans that own any of the
      above-described types of policies would exceed 20 % at this time .'
    - Roughly sixty percent of Americans will require long term care services sometime
      during their lifetime . This is not exclusively a problem for the elderly as
      younger people can require this type of care some times . This level of care
      includes a range of services including skilled and custodial care that is provided
      over a long period of time . These requirements come from chronic sickness or
      injury , cognitive impairment and physical disability . Hospitals provide acute
      care . Medical care given over a long period of time for chronic conditions
      is where the need for long term care arises . Sometimes custodial care is required
      because the patient has lost the ability to do one of the recognized activities
      of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living . Most of the long
      term care given in the US is given by family members . However , there are many
      situations where family members can not provide necessary care . Professional
      and non-professionals can provide aid and assistance to these people . This
      long term care can be given in the home of the patient or in a variety of institutional
      settings . Long term care can be given in day-care facilities , nursing homes
      , and assisted living facilities . On average men need more than two years of
      long term care while women need almost four years on average ? The leading causes
      for patients requiring long term care are dementia , arthritis , cancer , stroke
      and nervous conditions . Caring for a patient in a home setting can cost up
      to $ 150,000 per year . The cost for a nursing home bed is about $ 75,000 per
      year -LRB- this varies by location . -RRB- There are basically four ways to
      finance long term care . The family can take the expense out of their own pocket
      , they can look to government programs -LRB- if they qualify , -RRB- they can
      use long term care insurance or they can rely upon charity . For a variety of
      reasons long term care insurance has provided a solution for many people . LTC
      insurance provides predictability for an otherwise unpredictable risk . It has
      become such popular coverage and policyholders have been so reluctant to drop
      their coverage that the benefits have started exceeding the premiums . It is
      quite popular among wealthy policyholders . Many companies that offered coverage
      have withdrawn and others have been forced to raise their premiums . This adjustment
      seems to be complete now . There are various forms of LTC coverage . Policies
      different widely . It is rather difficult to compare but is worth the effort
      . When deciding on a policy the first thing to establish is the amount of coverage
      you want and the period of time you want coverage . The second consideration
      is how soon after the start of long term care will you want the policy to start
      paying . This waiting period is computed in several ways so care must be exercised
      to make sure you are making a fair comparison . Not all policies use the same
      events to trigger benefits so care should be taken in this area as well . This
      can be a very technical area so compare your situation with the policy requirements
      . How a policy pays out will vary according to the policy . Some policies provide
      for reimbursement of expenses , others use an indemnity form which pays up to
      a specific limit of expenses incurred on each specific day , and some are on
      a cash model which pays a maximum benefit regardless of the actual cost of the
      care that is being given . Long term care insurance is a way to protect assets
      . The alternatives deplete assets with the government programs requiring a person
      to be in poverty .
    - Long Term Health Care Insurance is called , simply , Long Term Care Insurance
      . It covers the cost of living in a nursing home , assisted living home , or
      receiving other types of services when the insured person is unable to take
      care of themselves . Among those who should buy Long Term Care Insurance are
      those who have many assets and feel strongly that they do not want their assets
      to go toward paying long term care expenses . People who want to have many choices
      in how and where they are cared for , should they be unable to care for themselves
      , are also people who would benefit from Long Term Care insurance , if they
      can afford it . Finally , persons whose families want the security of knowing
      that their parents will not rely on them for long term care , if needed , are
      those who should considering buying Long Term Care insurance .
    - Not everyone needs long term care insurance . LTCI is not for persons who are
      struggling to meet their day to day living expenses , rent an apartment , and
      have little savings and no investments . If such a person needed to go to a
      nursing home , Medicaid will almost immediately start picking up their tab and
      they will be fine . Long term care insurance is for those who have substantial
      assets or income that they do n't want to `` lose '' by paying high long term
      care costs . Some people are OK with their savings going to long term care expenses
      , if needed . They figure that is why they saved . Others feel strongly that
      they want to pass that wealth to heirs to continue a business , care for a disabled
      adult child , or help grandchildren go to college , among a myriad of other
      reasons . It is this latter segment of the population that `` needs '' long
      term care insurance , especially if they are not so very wealthy that paying
      nursing home expenses for many years would simply dent their resources , rather
      than deplete them . If they can afford long term care insurance , but would
      not be able to to pay for long term care services , people who are adamant about
      choosing the type of care they receive , or persons who are setting up a plan
      so that their children do n't have to worry about it , also could use long term
      care insurance . As long as Medicaid is around , no one absolutely needs long
      term care insurance . But for all the reasons above , many people would consider
      it a need if they looked at it realistically .
    - 70 % of people who are 65 years old will need to use some type of long term
      care in their lifetime . And , as they age the likelihood of needing long term
      care will increase . The cost for this care is very expensive and it is not
      covered by conventional health insurance - commercial carriers or Medicare .
      This is because our health care system is geared to acute care not long term
      care . According to the 2015 Genworth survey the national average cost for a
      semi-private room in a nursing home is about $ 80,000 . More , for a private
      room . Home Health care costs average $ 20/hour . These expense arise when most
      people are living on a fixed income with little room for added expenses . Especially
      , unplanned ones . Baby boomers have not been great at planning for retirement
      . One year of long term care can ruin someone 's retirement plans . This is
      what happens in many cases ; families deplete their assets and end up qualifying
      for Medicaid -LRB- aka Welfare -RRB- to pay for long term care expenses . The
      question people need to ask themselves is when the need for long term care arises
      , will they have the money to pay for this care ? This is what long term care
      insurance can do for them . Insurance is the only financial vehicle that promises
      a specific amount of money at a point in time . There is no other . Even though
      this can be an expensive premium , depending on the age at which the policy
      is purchased , compared to the benefits paid , it is worth the outlay for most
      people . Not only because it will help pay the bills . Long term care insurance
      policies offer additional benefits that most people are unaware of . Most importantly
      , all carriers offer optional care management to assist with the difficult decisions
      about care , choosing facilities and offering discounts on major providers of
      care . Many times families need someone to discuss options with who is educated
      about all the options available and is n't emotionally involved with their situation
      . This is where the care manager can be of tremendous help and the family does
      not have to go to the expense of hiring a geriatric care manager . The policies
      will also pay for modifications to be made to the home to keep the person at
      home rather than moving them to a nursing home .
    - The average cost of long-term care insurance depends on a number of factors
      as the policies are very customizable . If you 're looking for a more basic
      option , I would estimate a range of around $ 1,800 - $ 2,300 per year in premiums
      . If you want something more comprehensive , you 're probably looking at something
      more so in the range of $ 4,000 - $ 6,000 per year . The most comprehensive
      plans can be $ 7,000 or more per year . Factors such as the person 's age ,
      health , only applying as an individual , applying as a married couple , daily
      benefit levels , benefit periods , compound inflation options , elimination/waiting
      periods , and other items will really impact what the cost for a plan will be
      . In today 's world , there 's a very good chance you will need long-term care
      at some point in your life . If you were paying for long-term care out of pocket
      , you can expect to be writing a check for at least $ 40,000 per year - something
      more specialized like a nursing home , then possibly well over $ 100,000 per
      year . Unfortunately , not too many people can write that check . While writing
      a check for several thousand dollars a year in premiums for long-term care coverage
      can have a bit of sticker shock , it can potentially save you 10 's of thousands
      of dollars in the future if it happens to you . So the idea of the coverage
      is to transfer the risk to the insurance company in exchange for a small premium
      and use their money rather than your own to pay for the expenses if that care
      is ever needed . The long and short being that the `` average cost '' is an
      irrelevant figure . It only gives you an idea . The actual cost you can expect
      to pay depends on your needs and what you want to accomplish with the coverage
      . From there you can start to compare numbers . I would suggest speaking with
      an independent insurance agent who works with long-term care insurance products
      and can compare multiple companies for you . An agent can help you sort through
      all the zigs and zags of long-term care insurance and help determine what coverage
      will best serve your needs . If you need help with your coverage , please feel
      free to call or e-mail me via the contact me button - I have an agent in my
      group with a strong background in long-term care insurance . I hope the information
      is helpful - please let me know if you have any other questions . Thanks very
      much .
    - 'Whether long-term care insurance should be `` mandated '''' requires an associated
      question : `` Mandated by whom ? '''' Also , any question that includes the
      word `` should '''' involves a question of values and may fall into a political
      category of some kind.The question , however , is a good one . We have a looming
      crisis that has only just begun . Millions of people will soon be at the age
      of possibly needing extended care before they pass away . The current `` baby
      boom '''' demographic has hit retirement age and is about 20-30 years from cresting
      at an age that many may need care before dying . Unless there are many medical
      advances , care accommodations , and/or technological improvements for elder
      care , hundreds of thousands of people in their 70s , 80s , and 90s and beyond
      will need assistance in successfully performing the activities of day-to-day
      life , such as feeding oneself , getting from one place to another , dressing
      , bathing , etc.Who is going to provide that care ? First , it will be family
      -LRB- spouse and/or adult children , if available -RRB- , but beyond that ,
      there is only Medicaid -LRB- Medical in CA -RRB- to provide care services .
      The problem is that one must become `` indigent '''' to qualify for government
      aid , and one must be admitted to an approved facility to receive care . -LRB-
      Medicare currently only provides hospital , recovery , and skilled nursing care
      for a maximum period of 100 days . A hospital stay for a minimum of three days
      is required to qualify in most cases . -RRB- If the questioner is asking should
      the government be mandated to provide long-term care , then this is entirely
      a political question . The government , ultimately , is the tax-payer . Congress
      is the body of our government that legislates laws.If the questioner is asking
      should everyone be mandated to purchase their own long-term care coverage ,
      the answer is probably `` no '''' . Even though that might seem like a solution
      , the cost of privately-owned long-term care is currently far beyond the reach
      of many Americans . Some could not even afford the premiums of a base policy
      which would n''t come close to paying what long-term care might end up costing.A
      commission formed by Congress is currently meeting to debate and hear testimony
      on the question of how we , as a society , will handle those that have no family
      or other support group , do not own long-term care insurance , and are `` taking
      too long to die '''' . This makes the question a moral one , and one that deserves
      an answer so that people may die with dignity .'
    - No , Disability Insurance is not the same as Long Term Care Insurance , although
      they do have a lot of similarities . Long Term Disability Insurance pays persons
      who are unable to work at their regular jobs because of becoming disabled .
      There is an elimination period , just like Long Term Care , and there may be
      a limit on the years of benefit , just like LTC -LRB- these are determined when
      taking out the policy -RRB- . But the amount the Disability Insurance pays is
      a percent of what those employees made in their jobs and can be used however
      they wish . For Long Term Care Insurance , there must be certain conditions
      met besides just being unable to work at one 's job , order to receive benefits
      . These triggers include inability to do 2-3 activities of daily living independently
      , cognitive/mental impairment , and nursing home or other long term care ordered
      by a doctor . The payments might be paid to the insured persons or they might
      be paid directly to the facilities offering the care , depending on the type
      of policy that was purchased .
    - Long Term Health Insurance -LRB- known as Long Term Care Insurance -RRB- is
      worth it for some people and not for others . If you have a large amount of
      savings , investments , and/or property , Long Term Care Insurance can protect
      your estate by paying for the cost of caring for you if you can not care for
      yourself . If you have very little in the way of assets , LTCI may not be worth
      it , as Medicaid would cover the cost of staying in a nursing home . However
      , whether you have a large estate or not , Long Term Care Insurance does provide
      some freedom in choosing where you receive your care . And for some people that
      is worth the price of the insurance .
    - Long Term Care is the elephant in the room . Many carriers have exited the market
      because they were not able to make money in this niche . The question you should
      be asking is what will happen if my spouse or I require care ? You will not
      find any good answer unless you have coverage or can afford the $ 70,000 per
      year plus that it costs . The changes of needing care are high , but not for
      a long period of time . In addition , there are several other ways of paying
      for long term care with life insurance and annuity riders that you should investigate
      .
    - Long Term Care Insurance is insurance that pays for extended care needs of persons
      who are no longer able to care for themselves due to illness or injury . To
      begin receiving the benefits of a long term care insurance policy , the insured
      person must show that they can not do at least two activities of daily living
      on their own -LRB- such as dressing , bathing , etc -RRB- . Cognitive impairment
      is also a trigger for LTC insurance to pay out . People purchase long term care
      insurance to empower themselves in their later years by not having to liquidate
      their estate to pay for this huge expense , and also to use the policy to purchase
      the type of long term care that they desire .
    - Everyone comes into the discussion about long term care insurance from a different
      angle , because we all have different experiences . As an insurance website
      , we rightfully describe the financial implications of the products in question
      . But as human beings , we interject our experiences , as well . Some of us
      see it from the view of the caregiver/family , having been caregivers by default
      for a parent who did not have long term care insurance , or watched our `` healthy
      '' parent struggle to care for the sick one . Some of us have adult children
      urging us to get long term care insurance because they know that they would
      have to give up homes and jobs to come care for us . Some of us see it from
      the view of the person needing the care . Time spent in a nursing home quickly
      reveals those who could have had a higher quality life living in their own home
      , with the resources that LTC insurance provides . There are the `` rich ''
      in the single room whose resources are dwindling with each passing year , and
      who may eventually not be able to sustain that luxury of a private room by having
      to go on Medicaid . No matter what angle from which you view it , there are
      good reasons to get long term care insurance . There are also reasons not to
      get it , as Mr. Bridgers so eloquently stated about both sides .
    - Under Medicare any type of Home Health Care is limited . They will provide some
      skilled care on a temporary basis but Medicare generally will not pay for custodial
      care in any long term care environment . That is why it is important to carry
      some type of Long Term Care Insurance that will provide Home Health Care . Some
      policies even pay family members for providing care . A good agent who does
      long term care planning can help you find a program that will help .
    - 'Most advisers begin addressing long term care insurance with the clients around
      age 50 . But the buying public tends to purchase long term care insurance around
      age 60 . A couple of considerations here : You want to buy long term care when
      your healthy an relatively young to afford the premiums . But even if youre
      healthy , whats the predisposition of your family regarding assisted living
      and nursing home confinement ? If theres negative health history , then buying
      long term care earlier may be more prudent .'
    - My parents applied for Long Term Care Insurance many years ago , and my mother
      was able to qualify for it , but my father was not . My father 's declined over
      these many years , and toward the end , it was a worry whether my mom could
      continue to care for him or not . Thankfully , she was , but it was a difficult
      situation , to say the least . Now my mom has long term care insurance and you
      can tell it brings her peace . Even though she does not have anyone at home
      to care for her , like she did for Dad , she will have the funds to do what
      she needs to do if she can not care for herself . This personal experience has
      made it more real to me that , if you are not close to qualifying for Medicaid
      , you should probably have Long Term Care Insurance .
    - 'Long Term Care Insurance is not an investment at all . It is a morbidity insurance
      product to fund long term care expenses , generally a defensive planning tactic
      during retirement . If the question is along the lines of : Is long term care
      insurance money worth spending , then the answer is yes . If you dont have long
      term care , then your investments will be at risk to the expenditures of extended
      care during your senior years .'
    - What 's the best age to buy Long Term Care Insurance ? There are many opinions
      as to the answer for that question , offered by professionals in the insurance
      field and in by professionals in the field of issues related to aging . As someone
      who has a background in both fields , I think the best age to purchase Long
      Term Care Insurance is by age 60 . Rates are lower and you are less likely to
      have a medical condition to disqualify you than if you wait longer than that
      . Some cite statistics that over 40 % of Long Term Care is provided to persons
      under age 65 , so you should purchase LTC coverage at a much younger age . But
      many of the younger persons in extended care facilities have mental illness
      or other lifelong conditions that would not have qualified them for LTC insurance
      in the first place . It is certainly true that the younger you are , the lower
      the rates , but you do have to offset the extra years for which you will be
      making those payments . More important than that , I believe , is getting the
      policy while you still qualify . If you see some health conditions sneaking
      up on you at age 40 that could be trouble at age 60 , get your Long Term Care
      coverage while you can .

    - Medicare will not pay for Nicorette gum or patch , or other smoking cessation
      products . When making the effort to quit smoking , Medicare will pay forup
      to 8 face-to-face smoking cessation counseling sessions with a qualified Medicare
      doctor during a 12 month period .
    - The answer to your question will vary from health insurance carrier to health
      insurance carrier and may also be determined by whether your employer 's coverage
      is self-funded and they have made a determination about the coverage of nicotine
      gum . Coverage for smoking cessationprograms has almost universally been adopted
      by health insurance carriers for its obvious positive effects on the health
      of their members . However , what treatments and medications they will cover
      for smoking cessation are determined by each insurance carrier and are not uniform
      across the industry . You should check with your health insurance provider 's
      customer service department to get more detailed information about what your
      coverage is in this regard . My general experience is that the nicotine patch
      is more likely to be covered than nicotine gum . Also , there are several prescription
      medications that are available for use in smoking cessation and you may find
      that some or all of these are covered by your health insurance .
    - Zyban is chemically similar to Buproprion . Both medications are used to treat
      depression but also can be used as part of a smoking cessation program . Buproprion
      is covered by Medicare Part D and does not require prior authorization from
      your carrier . Zyban may be prescribed by your doctor as part of a smoking cessation
      program if other treatment protocols have not worked . Medicare Part D may require
      prior authorization .
    - Health insurance cost more for smokers om most medical plans . The exception
      is a `` short-term '' policy with selected carriers . For temporary policies
      , often the smoking status is not considered in determining the rate . When
      State Exchanges/Marketplaces begin offering coverage -LRB- You should continue
      to purchase coverage through a broker and/or their website -RRB- in 2014 , smoking
      will impact all plans . Although any existing conditions will not impact the
      rate , smoking will . So if you can stop , it will save money . If you ca n't
      , many smoking cessation expenses will be covered under the new plans .
    - Smokers are considered a health risk and unfortunately will always pay a higher
      premium . The serious health conditions that are associated with smoking means
      smokers have a shorter life expectancy . If one is a smoker the best course
      of action would be to seek some type of smoking cessation program . One small
      word of advice ; if your option is the electronic cigarette this will show up
      in the para-meds as nicotine usage . In some cases it will afford you a lower
      premium however your rating class with most insurance companies will be listed
      as smoker .
    - The answer to your question will vary from insurance carrier to insurance carrier
      . While smoking cessation program coverage has become almost standard in health
      insurance policies , the approved methods and medications are determined by
      each health insurance carrier . As such , there is no simple , Yes or No answer
      to your question . You will need to check with your insurance carrier to determine
      what your plan with them covers and the steps you need to take to have your
      efforts to stop smoking covered . In general terms , nicotine patches seem to
      be more favored by health insurance carriers than nicotine gum . Also , there
      are several prescription medications that are approved for smoking cessation
      and are generally covered under the pharmacy benefit of most health insurers
      .
    - As a general rule , Medicare does not cover hypnotherapy . If your doctor or
      therapist recommends hypnosis for weight loss or smoking cessation , the treatment
      is not covered . But in some cases Medicare can pay for hypnotherapy . If hypnosis
      is used in conjunction with treatment for PTSD or pain management it may be
      a covered expense .
    - It depends on your policy but more and more companies are paying for smoking
      cessation programs prescribed by a doctor . It depends on the company so check
      with your agent or call the company to receive a more definitive answer to your
      question . Your agent or customer service can help you .
    - If you only have Medicare A & B or Parts A & B plus a Medigap plan , Medicare
      is going to pay first . When you have more than one plan paying a claim , the
      process has to follow the coordination of benefits rules to determine who pays
      first and who pays second . The majority of the time , people who are on Medicare
      will have two types of coverage when they or their spouse works for an employer
      . Self-employed individuals will generally only be on Medicare and drop their
      under 65 policy -LRB- unless their spouse has group coverage they can be on
      -RRB- . How big the company is and whether or not the insured employee is working
      will generally determine who pays first . If the employer has 20 or more employees
      , the employer plan will pay first and Medicare second . If the employer has
      less than 20 employees , Medicare will pay first and the employer will pay second
      . If you 're on Medicare for a disability , the employer plan pays first and
      Medicare pays second if there are 100 or more employees - if there are less
      than 100 employees , Medicare pays first and the employer plan pays second .
    - If you only have Medicare A & B or Parts A & B plus a Medigap plan , Medicare
      is going to pay first . When you have more than one plan paying a claim , the
      process has to follow the coordination of benefits rules to determine who pays
      first and who pays second . The majority of the time , people who are on Medicare

      will generally determine who pays first . If the employer has 20 or more employees
      , the employer plan will pay first and Medicare second . If the employer has

      Medicare pays second if there are 100 or more employees - if there are less
      than 100 employees , Medicare pays first and the employer plan pays second .
      Please let me know if I can be of further assistance . Thanks very much .
    - COPD stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . It manifests itself
      in chronic bronchitis , emphysema , or -LRB- most commonly -RRB- a combination
      of the two . Most COPD is caused by a history of smoking and is progressive
      in nature . When applying for life insurance , underwriters will look at pulmonary
      function , whether or not the patient is still smoking , severity and frequency
      of symptoms , and whether portable oxygen is used . Very mild COPD may qualify
      for medically underwritten coverage . Generally , simplified issue policies
      must be used for persons with moderate to severe COPD . If oxygen is used ,
      the applicant will most likely need to purchase guaranteed issue life insurance
      , if it is available at their age .
    - 'Some other characteristics include the following : 1 . Occupational class :
      A category the insured falls into based on their job title and specif duties
      . The occ class dictates the premium . 2 . Rating : This comes when an underwriter
      approves an application , but with a higher than normal premium because the
      insured is a higher risk -LRB- typically due to their health history , smoking
      history , weight , etc. -RRB- . The rating can be anything from 15 to 100 %
      more in premium , though it can often times be reconsidered after a few years
      if the client loses and keeps off weight , stops smoking , etc. 3 . Cost of
      living rider -LRB- COLA -RRB- : This optional benefit increases the disability
      benefit by a certain percentage , typically determined by the latest Consumer
      Price Index .'
    - I 'm not aware of any health insurance plans that require blood and/or urine
      tests to qualify for . That said , the information is usually available through
      past medical history and may be found in the MIB -LRB- Medical Information Bureau
      -RRB- or your current doctor 's chart notes . The risk for someone who is a
      smoker and omits that information , is a cancelled policy . Usually this would
      occur at the worst possible time , during the filing of a large claim . With
      smoking , some states do not apply the 2 year contestibility clause and consider
      a contract between the insurer and insured to never have existed , so premiums
      are refunded . While with health insurance you may not be tested for smoking
      , they reserve and you consent to the right for them to check your health history
      , so any doctor you 've told or any treatment you 've had the possibility would
      exist that there is a record of it .
    - The cost of life insurance for a smoker varies with age , gender and build ,
      just as it does for life insurance for a nonsmoker . However , when you throw
      in a health condition , being a smoker can increase premiums much more than
      it does for a nonsmoker . Smoking while having diabetes , heart disease , COPD
      , even osteoporosis , can cause rates to jump exponentially , or even be declined
      . One way to get around this can be to purchase a simplified issue life insurance
      policy . Their smoker rates tend to not have quite as large a variation as medically
      underwritten policies , and they may not be as strict about the impact of smoking
      upon that health condition . There are also medically underwritten policies
      that treat smokers much better than others . Contact an agency that specializes
      in smoker life insurance to get your most competitive rate .
    - Smoking affects life insurance rates but how much depends on other health and
      lifestyle factors . In general , the premium for term life insurance for people
      in their thirties and forties is three times more for tobacco users than for
      non tobacco users . The factor widens on older individuals . For permanent -LRB-
      cash value -RRB- policies the difference is not as great . The kind of smoking
      or tobacco use affects rates , too . In recent years , a few innovative insurance
      companies have been offering non tobacco rates to cigar smokers and users of
      smokeless tobacco making their tobacco class rates effectively cigarette user
      rates . Celebratory cigar use e.g. once or twice a year at weddings , may even
      qualify at such innovative insurance companies for preferred non tobacco premium
      rates .
    - That is a really good question ! Every insurance company will try to sell you
      on the fact that they are the `` best '' . The truth is that there is often
      not a lot that separates one policy from the other , especially when it comes
      to straight term policies . So what makes one company `` better '' than the
      next ? There are companies that underwrite differently , and if you have an
      issue , then the one that writes best for your issue is `` best '' . Or if you
      like the occasional cigar , but otherwise do n't smoke , then a company that
      does n't count that cigar as smoking is `` best '' . A good independent agent
      can help find the company that can best suit you . Thanks for asking !
    - That is a great question ! In the case of you purchasing a policy for a larger
      face value , the insurance company will send out a para-med who will take samples
      or swabs from you to test for the markers of nicotine use . In the case of a
      smaller face value policy , there will be a question on your application , and
      then subsequent ones relating to smoking related diseases . If at some point
      the company has reason to believe that your answers during the application process
      are less than truthful , they may elect to deny or delay your payment on those
      grounds . The best thing to do is quit smoking , or find a company that is lenient
      with their tobacco rules , or one that does n't ask at all . They exist , and
      a good agent can find one for you . I hope that helps , thanks for asking !
    - That is a great question ! If you are asking because you are trying to get a
      cheaper rate , I 'd advise you not to try , though . If , God forbid , you die
      as a result of a smoking related illness , and it states that in your death
      certificate , and you were listed as a non smoker , you can bet your last dollar
      that your beneficiary will have a hard time collecting . If the company suspects
      that you were fraudulent on your application , rest assured they will not be
      happy . Please just sign it as smoking , then after you 've quit and are clean
      , revise your policy and get the cheaper rate . It 's a much better way to do
      it . Thank you for asking !
