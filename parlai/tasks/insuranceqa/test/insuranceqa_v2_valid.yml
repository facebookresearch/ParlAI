    - Sadly no . Medicare does cover a lot of the medical and hospital expenses incurred
      by a hospital stay . But it does not cover the co-pays required by Medicare
      . Medicare will cover 80 % leaving the insured to cover the other 20 % along
      with a payment due as a copayment . These payments must be made by the insured
      or by an insurance policy .

    - 'Medigap policies serve as a supplement to Original Medicare . Original medicare
      is an 80/20 plan , where Medicare pays 80 % of the approved charges . The beneficiary
      is typically responsible for the 20 % co-insurance as well as co-pays and deductibles
      that come with Medicare Parts A & B . The Medigap policy is designed to pick
      up the 20 % Medicare does n''t cover in exchange for a monthly premium payable
      to the carrier selected . The most comprehensive Medigap policy is Plan F ,
      which covers all of the Part A & B deductible , co-insurance and co-pays , so
      when the beneficiary goes to receive care their is zero out-of-pocket costs
      . Some plans may also provide benefits like foreign travel as well as a gym
      membership as part of your regular plan . Please note : when purchasing a Medigap
      Policy , you need to add a Stand-Alone Prescription Drug Plan to satisfy your
      requirement as a Medicare Beneficiary to have Part D - Prescription Drug Coverage
      met .'
    - There are 10 standardized Medigap Plans available to Medicare Beneficiaries
      . They include Plan A , B , C , D , F , G , K , L , M , N with Plan F also offering
      a high-deductible plan . The most popular standardized Medigap Plans are F ,
      G , and N. Plan F will cover all your Medicare approved charges . You do not
      have to pay any co-pays , co-insurance or deductibles for Medicare covered costs
      . If you choose the high-deductible Plan F , you must pay for Medicare covered
      costs up to the deductible amount of $ 2,140 -LRB- 2014 -RRB- before your Medigap
      Plan F will pay anything . Plan G will cover all your Medicare approved charges
      after you have satisfied the annual Part B deductible of $ 147 -LRB- 2014 -RRB-
      . Once the small deductible is met , Medigap Plan G acts like Plan F and covers
      the co-pays , co-insurance and deductibles that Original Medicare does not cover
      . Plan N covers 100 % of the Part B co-insurance , except for a small co-pay
      for some office visits -LRB- never more than $ 20 per visit -RRB- and up to
      a co-pay of $ 50 for emergency room visits -LRB- waived if admitted as an inpatient
      -RRB- . You are also responsible for satisfying the annual Part B deductible
      of $ 147 -LRB- 2014 -RRB- and any Medicare Part B Excess Charges . If you have
      further questions regarding your specific situation , please feel free to contact
      me .
    - 'Medigap Plan N is one of the 10 standardized Medicare Supplement plans . Medigap
      Plan N covers 100 % of the following : Medicare Part A Coinsurance and hospital
      costs up to an additional 365 days after Medicare benefits are used up . Medicare
      Part B Coinsurance -LRB- except for a co-pay of up to $ 20 for some office visits
      and up to $ 50 co-pay for an emergency room visit -- waived if admitted -RRB-
      . Blood -LRB- first 3 pints -RRB- Part A Hospice Care Coinsurance or Co-pay
      Skilled Nursing Facility Care Coinsurance Medicare Part A deductible Foreign
      Travel Emergency -LRB- Up to Plan Limits -RRB- Medigap Plan N DOES NOT cover
      the following : Medicare Part B deductible -LRB- $ 147 in 2014 -RRB- Medicare
      Part B Excess Charges -LRB- if the amount a provider is legally permitted to
      charge is higher than the Medicare approved amount , the difference is the excess
      charge -RRB- . Medigap Plan N is used by many Medicare Beneficiaries , but it
      does fall short in not covering Excess Charges . It is important to be aware
      of how Excess Charges can be charged to you by a provider who does not accept
      assignment . You may wonder why anyone would bother with Plan N if they have
      to worry about Excess Charges . The premium for Plan N is often the reason why
      people choose it .'
    - Original Medicare Part A & B do not come with Co-Pays . You are , however ,
      responsible for deductibles and co-insurance . Co-pays are mostly associated
      with Medicare Advantage Plans and Prescription Drug Plans . The co-pays do have
      a wide range from one Plan to the next , so it is always a good idea to review
      the Outline of Coverage for the Plan you have or may be considering . If you
      have a Medigap Plan -LRB- also known as Medicare Supplement insurance -RRB-
      , there is one standardized plan that does have co-pays . With Plan N , the
      customer is responsible for co-pays for doctor visits . The co-pay will not
      be more than $ 20 for an office visit . Plan N also requires a $ 50 co-pay for
      an emergency room visit . This co-pay is waived if you are admitted into the
      hospital .
    - If you would like to have peace of mind knowing that the remaining 20 % of Medicare
      approved charges will be covered by insurance -LRB- instead of your bank account
      -RRB- , then Medigap insurance is absolutely worth it . Medicare Beneficiaries
      with Original Medicare Part A and Part B leave themselves vulnerable to the
      ` gaps ' that Medicare does not cover -LRB- co-insurance , co-pays and deductibles
      -RRB- . This can add up quickly . For example , a $ 5,000 procedure would leave
      you with a bill for $ 1,000 -LRB- 20 % co-insurance -RRB- . A $ 20,000 procedure
      would bill you for $ 4,000 -LRB- 20 % co-insurance -RRB- . You see where this
      is going ... $ 50,000 operation means you 're stuck with a $ 10,000 hospital
      bill . Not to mention -- if you have a chronic illness , twenty-percent co-insurance
      can put a huge burden on your budget . I have spoken to Medicare Beneficiaries
      who are paying the 20 % co-insurance . Some do n't mind because they have n't
      had any health issues , but others do have health issues and did n't realize
      they could n't get a Medigap Plan once they were sick . Meaning , you are not
      always guaranteed a Medigap Plan whenever you want to buy one . If you are not
      in your initial Open Enrollment Period or another Guaranteed Issue Situation
      , you 'll have to qualify medically . If I can assist you with your personal
      situation , please feel free to contact me .
    - 'What is BEST is so subjective . Office Co-pays , Rx Co-pays , Low Deductible
      , High Deductible , & more all play into the flexible definition of BEST ...
      . HOWEVER , I do see a growing trend that can put a more objective -- that is
      the TYPE of network you buy . PPO / HMO / POS / EPO . Do you know what these
      acronyms mean ? Do you understand the impact on WHO YOU CAN SEE when you pick
      a different network . In my area , Nashville TN , the difference in networks
      is HUGE between carriers . The top carrier has 2002 Family doctors in a 50 mile
      radius of down town ... the # 2 carrier for 2016 ... . only 270 . 86.5 % LESS
      doctors to go see . Cardiologists : 201 vs 34 ... 83 % LESS !!! I will stand
      on the statement , `` There ARE better plans . The better plan gives you greater
      access to doctors & hospitals in your area & possibly nationally . '''''
    - Medigap or Medicare Supplement insurance is private health insurance established
      to help supplement Original Medicare Part A and Part B. Meaning , it will help
      pay some of the health care costs not covered by Original Medicare -LRB- co-pays
      , deductibles , co-insurance -RRB- . When you have a Medigap Policy , Medicare
      will pay it 's share of Medicare approved amounts for your covered health care
      costs . Then your Medigap -LRB- Medicare Supplement insurance -RRB- pays its
      share . There are 10 standardized Medigap Plans -LRB- A , B , C , D , F , G
      , K , L , M , N -RRB- with varying benefits . Plan F is the most popular because
      it covers all Medicare approved charges and you do not have to pay any co-pays
      , deductibles or co-insurance . Plan G acts just like Plan F after you 've satisfied
      the small annual Part B deductible of $ 147 -LRB- 2014 -RRB- . WEBSITELINK Please
      feel free to contact me regarding your specific situation . In just a matter
      of minutes , I can provide you with Medigap benefit and quote information to
      help you make an informed decision .
    - If you have group coverage you may not need to pick up Medicare part B right
      away depending on the size of your group . Medicare coordinates with your health
      insurance . For smaller groups it will be primary , for larger groups it would
      be secondary . Primary means that Medicare pays first and your health insurance
      would act like a supplement . Secondary means that your insurance pays first
      and Medicare would just help pay any deductibles and copay 's . You do not need
      a Medicare supplement if you have group health insurance in most cases . If
      you have prescriptions covered at work do not pick up a Medicare Advantage plan
      or prescription drug plan without discussing it with your HR rep. You could
      get knocked off your group coverage and not be able to get it back .
    - In short , Medigap does not cover non-medically necessary procedures -LRB- e.g.
      cosmetic surgery -RRB- and items such as routine dental work and eye exams .
      Individual dental insurance plans and vision insurance plans will cover the
      latter programs - elective cosmetic surgery is generally going to be paid 100
      % out-of-pocket no matter what . Medigap plans pay benefits when you have a
      Medicare-approved service claim . Please note , each Medigap plan features different
      benefits so the question can expand from there as not every Medigap plan covers
      every available Medigap benefit . For example , plan F covers each Medigap benefit
      at 100 % from day 1 -LRB- and 80 % for foreign travel emergency care , up to
      plan lifetime limits of $ 50,000 -RRB- . Plan N covers each Medigap benefit
      at 100 % from day 1 except for coverage of the Medicare Part B deductible -LRB-
      $ 147 in 2014 and 2015 -RRB- , Part B excess charges , and you have to pay a
      co-pay when you go to the doctor -LRB- up to $ 20 co-pay -RRB- or hospital -LRB-
      up to $ 50 co-pay -RRB- . I hope the information is helpful - please feel free
      to contact me for further help , including quotes and plan comparisons , and
      if you have any other questions . Thanks very much .
    - Unlike Medicare Advantage Plans , Open Enrollment for Medicare Supplements vary
      by State . Generally most States have a six month Open Enrollment Period after
      Turning 65 to enroll in a Medicare Supplement on a Guaranteed Issue basis .
      After your Open Enrollment Period you will be able to change your Medicare Supplement
      at any time subject to the companies underwriting requirements , meaning you
      must qualify health wise . Keep in mind you will also need to pick up a Prescription
      Drug Plan -LRB- Medicare Part D -RRB- . The Initial Election Period for Medicare
      Part D is three months before , the month of and three months after you turn
      65 .
    - Original Medicare Part A & Medicare Part B does not cover co-pays , deductibles
      or coinsurance . In fact , it covers only about 80 % of your healthcare costs
      . The remaining 20 % is your responsibility and is limitless unless you have
      a Medicare Supplement Plan -LRB- Medigap Plan -RRB- . Depending on which Medicare
      Supplement Plan you have it can pay all or most of those costs . For more information
      about Medicare or to Compare Medicare Supplement Plans instantly online visit
      our website at SummitMedigap.com .
    - Medicare Part B does not cover prescriptions . Medicare Part A & B only covers
      about up to 80 % of the total costs of healthcare related charges . You can
      get a Medicare Supplement Plan to cover the co-insurance , deductibles and other
      expenses that Part A & B does not cover . In addition , you can get a Part D
      prescription drug plan to cover your prescriptions .
    - 'Jeff Foxworthy might say , `` You might need a Medicare supplement insurance
      policy if ... You get shot for looking at another man ''s birddog and you ca
      n''t afford to go to the hospital . After Medicare pays their portion you offer
      to settle your bill by arm wrestling in a winner take all match . Medicare only
      pays 80 % of your hospital bill and the only way you can pay the other 20 %
      is to sell your pick up truck with the big tires and gun rack in the back window
      . #GeorgiaMedigapPlanRates #GeorgiaMedicarePlans #GaMedigapQuotes'
    - Kidney dialysis is a Medicare Part B service . If you have End-Stage Renal Disease
      -LRB- also known as ESRD -RRB- , Medicare will -LRB- generally -RRB- coverthree
      dialysis treatments per week . You pay 20 % of the Medicare approved amount
      , and the Part B deductible applies . This is where your Medigap Plan will help
      cover some if not all of the remaining costs . Medigap Plan F will pay the remaining
      20 % of the Medicare approved amount and the applicable Part B deductible .
      You pay $ 0 . Medigap Plan G will pay the remaining 20 % of the Medicare approved
      amount after you have paid/met the applicable Part B deductible . You pay ,
      at most , $ 147 -LRB- Part B deductible in 2014 -RRB- . Medigap Plans A , B
      , D , M will pay the remaining 20 % of the Medicare approved amount after you
      have paid/met the applicable Part B deductible . However , you are also responsible
      for Part B Excess Charges , so you may end up paying more than the Part B deductible
      -LRB- $ 147 in 2014 -RRB- . Medigap Plan Cwill pay the remaining 20 % of the
      Medicare approved amount and the applicable Part B deductible ; however , you
      pay for any Medicare Part B Excess Charges . Medigap Plan Hi-F will pay all
      Medicare approved amounts after you have met/paid the $ 2,140 deductible -LRB-
      2014 -RRB- . Medigap Plan Nwill pay the remaining 20 % of the Medicare approved
      amount after you have paid/met the applicable Part B deductible -- except for
      a copay of up to $ 20 for some office visits . You are also responsible for
      paying Medicare Part B Excess Charges . In regards to Excess Charges , this
      is what you are charged above the Medicare approved amount if the doctor , provider
      , or supplier does not accept Assignment . If a provider does not accept Assignment
      , they are telling Medicare that they do not agree to accept the payment amount
      Medicare approves for the service -- this is how you can get billed for Part
      B Excess Charges .
    - Plan F also referred to as the Cadillac plan offers the most complete coverage
      out of the 10 available Medigap plans . Plan F is the most popular Medicare
      Supplement because you have no out-of-pocket cost because it covers all the
      gaps -LRB- deductibles , co-insurance and co-pays -RRB- in your Medicare Part
      A and Part B coverage . Because it offers the most complete coverage Plan F
      is the most expensive Medicare Supplement and usually will experience the largest
      rate increase . Most people on Medicare would be better served by having a Plan
      G or Plan N .
    - Medicare supplements , also known as Medigap policies work in addition to your
      basic Medicare A and B coverage . Anything that is covered by either of those
      can then be applied to the Medigap plan to pick up some or all of the remaining
      costs . Inpatient dialysis is a Medicare A procedure . Outpatient or home dialysis
      options are covered by Part B . This does not include any costs for home health
      aides , lost wages , housing or blood supplies not included in the doctors visit
      . Depending on your Medigap policy , some of these may be covered . Your Medigap
      policy handbook will tell you if your plan covers these additional costs .
    - Medicare Part B premiums are based on your income . For most people , your Part
      B premium is $ 104.90 per month for 2013 , but high income earners could pay
      as much as $ 335.70 per month . If you do n't sign up for Part B when you are
      eligible , you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty . Your Part B will
      have a $ 147 annually deductible and a 20 % co-insurance . The important item
      to remember is that 20 % co-insurance has no limit .
    - In Florida , the best Medicare Supplement -LRB- Medigap -RRB- Plan will depend
      on your individual needs . Across the United States , Medigap Plans are standardized
      -LRB- plans have same benefits regardless of insurance carrier -RRB- . Not only
      can you use your plan benefits in Florida but anywhere in the U.S. as long as
      the provider accepts Medicare . Plan F is very popular because it covers all
      Medicare approved charges . But that does not mean it is the best plan for everyone
      . Plan F is the most expensive plan and Florida 's rates are among the highest
      in the country , and even though you can use your Medigap Plan outside of the
      state , you still have to buy the Plan in Florida if it 's where you reside
      . There are a couple other popular plans with lower premiums if you do n't mind
      small co-pays , co-insurance or meeting the Part B deductible . As a licensed
      independent agent in Florida , I can share with you the Plans that are available
      in your area . Since Medigap Plans are standardized , once you determine which
      Medicare Supplement insurance benefits you want then the next step is finding
      the premium that meets your budget . Thank you for reading my response . Please
      let me know if I can be of further assistance .
    - If you have Original Medicare Part A and Part B , you are responsible for twenty
      percent of your medical costs , the Part A deductible -LRB- $ 1,216 in 2014
      -RRB- and the Part B deductible -LRB- $ 147 in 2014 -RRB- . A Medigap Plan helps
      cover the deductibles , co-insurance and co-pays associated with Original Medicare
      . Often , people will wait until a significant health issue arises and then
      start looking into Medigap insurance . Unless you are still in your initial
      enrollment period or another guaranteed issue situation , you will have to pass
      medical underwriting requirements with the insurance company . The insurance
      companies are not obligated to sell you a policy because Medicare Supplement
      insurance does not fall under the Affordable Care Act . An independent agent
      specializing in Medicare Supplement Specialist can help determine if you can
      apply for a Medigap Plan based on health conditions . This is just one benefit
      of working with an independent agent . We are not employees of the insurance
      companies . We work for you and contract with many insurance companies to help
      meet the needs of every unique situation . Thank you for reading my reply .

      in the Yellow Pages or on the internet . Many Life Insurance agents also sell
      Long Term Care Insurance because many Life Insurance companies also offer Long
      Term Care policies . The agent must have special training as required by their
      state in order to sell Partnership Long Term Care Insurance .
    - 'Maybe one should not get long-term care insurance . Let ''s start there . If
      an individual or a family has a sizeable estate that either is liquid or can
      be liquidated and be made readily available to pay for the cost of long-term
      care , maybe long-term care is n''t needed . If , on the other extreme , you
      have a very small estate comprised of no real estate and very little personal
      property of any worth and will rely almost entirely on Social Security in retirement
      , you ca n''t afford long-term care premiums , now or in the future . You will
      have to have a plan , however , in case you do need long-term care . A family
      discussion around the topic should be scheduled so that those that might become
      either temporary or permanent caregivers are fully apprised of the responsibilities
      and sacrifices that may have to be made . Medicaid qualification should be fully
      investigated and the benefits and limitations understood . People buy long-term
      care for roughly the same reason they buy life insurance . One buys life insurance
      because they care about the financial security of those that are left behind
      . One buys long-term care insurancebecause they care about those that might
      have to take care of them if they ca n''t take care of themselves . Long-term
      care costs are not covered by conventional health insurance , Medicare , and
      most Medicare supplement insurance . They can be very expensive , especially
      ifthe elderly person lives a long-period of time in a state of incapacity .
      Caregivers will be spouses and adult children are likely to be caregivers whether
      one owns long-term care insurance or not . Long-term care insurance is for caregivers
      . It gives them choices about the quality of care that can be afforded and whether
      they can be relieved of some of the responsibility for caregiving . Many elderly
      spouses of those that ca n''t take care of themselves become disabled themselves
      because of the emotional and psychological energy expended in caregiving . Adult
      children sometimes get caught in a conflict over eldercare and parenting growing
      children . Long-term care insurance provides income-tax-free money to hire trained
      individuals to care for loved ones . Ultimately , it allows the insured to die
      with dignity and peace . Getting back to the wealthy that do n''t need to buy
      long-term care insurance , guess what ? Many wealthy couples and individuals
      do . They understand leverage : paying smaller dollars now for larger dollars
      later , if needed . They also understand that in many situations , premiums
      for long-term care may be tax-deductible . What about the middle class ? They
      would have to design their coverage to help offset the cost of long-term care
      . No matter how much one spends , no long-term care insurance policy can guarantee
      to cover all possible long-term care expenses . But , the average claim is about
      24 - 26 months . Buying a long-term care policy with a pool of money sufficient
      to cover at least part of those costs would be prudent . Is buying a basic plan
      for long-term care that would pay only half of one ''s long-term care costs
      be a bad deal ? I do n''t think anyone that ''s paying $ 400/day for facility
      care and being reimbursed for $ 200/day would find that of no value .'
    - 'A better question would be `` Who Should n''t Buy Long-term Care Insurance
      '''' ? Thats simpler to answer . The following people should NOT buy long term
      care insurance : 1 . Those that can not afford the premium on even a base policy
      . 2 . Those that have virtually no assets to pass on to the next generationand
      will need every available dollar saved for retirement . 3 . Those that will
      have to work until they die for lack of savings and insufficient Social Security
      payments or private pension . 4 . Those that can not medically qualify . 5 .
      Those that are already unable to perform regular daily activities of living
      without assistance . People in those conditions may qualify for the payment
      of long-term care through Medicaid -LRB- MediCal in California -RRB- if they
      come to a point in their life where they need care and ca n''t afford it . If
      the above conditions describe you in any way , you should be sitting down with
      your adult children or closest relatives and coming up with a plan of action
      should you be unable to take care of yourself . Everyone else should consider
      buying some long-term care insurance through an agent or agency that either
      specializes or has a specialist that is experienced in handling long-term care
      insurance casework . Having some amount of insurance is better than having none
      . When one qualifies to receive payments from the insurance company for long-term
      care , they are usually near the end of their life . The average long-term care
      claim is approximately 2 - 2.5 years . For those that need care longer than
      that , virtually all but the most unusual claims are paid out after 5 years
      . Families with a history of late-life mental illness -LRB- dementia or Alzheimers
      -RRB- should consider buying a larger pool of money than others , if they can
      afford it . It is in the best interest of the adult children to help out with
      long-term care premium payments if the elderly parents can not afford to pay
      all of the costs . Long-term care is an emotional , psychological , sociological
      , and family problem as much as it is financial . For the dignity of those who
      need care and the people or person most likely to be the caregiver , there needs
      to be a plan of action determined and long-term care insurance should be a part
      of that plan if it can be afforded and the person is medically qualified . Long-term
      care insurance is best purchased when young . Premiums can and will go up during
      the life of the policy if all the bells and whistles are included in the design
      of the coverage . But , those increases will seem like pocket-change if one
      needs long-term care . $ 80,000 per year is not unusual for facility care today
      . 24/7 home care can exceed $ 20,000 per month ! With family help , home care
      costs can be kept down . But , if facility care is required , there ''s not
      much that can be done about avoiding high costs . Long-term care costs vary
      by place . The left - and right-hand coasts are the most expensive . Relocation
      may be necessary to get affordable care in a quality facility .'
    - Roughly sixty percent of Americans will require long term care services sometime
      during their lifetime . This is not exclusively a problem for the elderly as
      younger people can require this type of care some times . This level of care
      includes a range of services including skilled and custodial care that is provided
      over a long period of time . These requirements come from chronic sickness or
      injury , cognitive impairment and physical disability . Hospitals provide acute
      care . Medical care given over a long period of time for chronic conditions
      is where the need for long term care arises . Sometimes custodial care is required
      because the patient has lost the ability to do one of the recognized activities
      of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living . Most of the long
      term care given in the US is given by family members . However , there are many
      situations where family members can not provide necessary care . Professional
      and non-professionals can provide aid and assistance to these people . This
      long term care can be given in the home of the patient or in a variety of institutional
      settings . Long term care can be given in day-care facilities , nursing homes
      , and assisted living facilities . On average men need more than two years of
      long term care while women need almost four years on average ? The leading causes
      for patients requiring long term care are dementia , arthritis , cancer , stroke
      and nervous conditions . Caring for a patient in a home setting can cost up
      to $ 150,000 per year . The cost for a nursing home bed is about $ 75,000 per
      year -LRB- this varies by location . -RRB- There are basically four ways to
      finance long term care . The family can take the expense out of their own pocket
      , they can look to government programs -LRB- if they qualify , -RRB- they can
      use long term care insurance or they can rely upon charity . For a variety of
      reasons long term care insurance has provided a solution for many people . LTC
      insurance provides predictability for an otherwise unpredictable risk . It has
      become such popular coverage and policyholders have been so reluctant to drop
      their coverage that the benefits have started exceeding the premiums . It is
      quite popular among wealthy policyholders . Many companies that offered coverage
      have withdrawn and others have been forced to raise their premiums . This adjustment
      seems to be complete now . There are various forms of LTC coverage . Policies
      different widely . It is rather difficult to compare but is worth the effort
      . When deciding on a policy the first thing to establish is the amount of coverage
      you want and the period of time you want coverage . The second consideration
      is how soon after the start of long term care will you want the policy to start
      paying . This waiting period is computed in several ways so care must be exercised
      to make sure you are making a fair comparison . Not all policies use the same
      events to trigger benefits so care should be taken in this area as well . This
      can be a very technical area so compare your situation with the policy requirements
      . How a policy pays out will vary according to the policy . Some policies provide
      for reimbursement of expenses , others use an indemnity form which pays up to
      a specific limit of expenses incurred on each specific day , and some are on
      a cash model which pays a maximum benefit regardless of the actual cost of the
      care that is being given . Long term care insurance is a way to protect assets
      . The alternatives deplete assets with the government programs requiring a person
      to be in poverty .
    - 'Short answer : About 8 % Long answer : It ''s hard to say exactly how many
      people own some type of policy that covers paying the costs of long term care
      - should one qualify for it - because there are many types of insurance policies
      that are not just `` stand-alone '''' long-term care policies , but plans of
      insurance that include being able to use a percentage of other plan benefits
      for paying long-term care costs :1 . Stand-alone long-term care insurance covers
      only long-term care costs . It has no cash value . When a policy owner dies
      , coverage either lapses or stops paying benefits . It is not transferable .
      It can not be bought or sold on a secondary market . This type of long-term
      care insurance is sometimes referred to as `` traditional '''' long-term care
      insurance , as well . It is the type of coverage that is most often associated
      with the `` percentage of Americans that own their own long-term care insurance
      '''' .2 . Hybrid long-term care contracts consist of having long-term coverage
      and a life insurance policy that guarantees to at least return the full premium
      paid into the policy to the insured ''s designated beneficiary . Usually , these
      are single-premium contracts , but some have options to also pay over a specified
      period of time , such as 5 - or 10-years .3 . Linked life + long-term care policies
      are basically a traditional permanent life insurance contract -LRB- Whole Life
      or Universal Life , including the Variable or Indexed type -RRB- . If a person
      qualifies for long-term care and they have the long-term care rider on their
      life policy , they may apply to the insurance company to advance or accelerate
      the face value of the policy -LRB- death benefit -RRB- to pay for the costs
      of care . There are various limitations on how much can be advanced at a time
      . If the face value of the life contract is completely advanced for long-term
      care , there is usually a residual death benefit of $ 5,000 - $ 10,000.4 . The
      latest addition to life insurance product lines are policies offering `` living
      benefits '''' , one of which is very similar to the linked-life policy . In
      fact , the only difference is that a medical professional has to state in writing
      that the insured is not likely to recover from the condition that qualifies
      for long-term care benefits . -LRB- True long-term care insurance does not require
      that . -RRB- This type of living benefit is most often referred to as `` chronic
      care '''' or `` extended care '''' . Annuities may also have special considerations
      for paying out portions of the account value for long-term care costs.The point
      is , people who own life insurance or annuity contracts with long-term care
      accommodations are not typically included in with the 8 % that own traditional
      long-term care . So , the real percentage of those that have made some type
      of insurance purchase to offset long-term care costs is greater than 8 % . I
      doubt , however , that the total percentage of Americans that own any of the
      above-described types of policies would exceed 20 % at this time .'
    - Long Term Health Care Insurance is called , simply , Long Term Care Insurance
      . It covers the cost of living in a nursing home , assisted living home , or
      receiving other types of services when the insured person is unable to take
      care of themselves . Among those who should buy Long Term Care Insurance are
      those who have many assets and feel strongly that they do not want their assets
      to go toward paying long term care expenses . People who want to have many choices
      in how and where they are cared for , should they be unable to care for themselves
      , are also people who would benefit from Long Term Care insurance , if they
      can afford it . Finally , persons whose families want the security of knowing
      that their parents will not rely on them for long term care , if needed , are
      those who should considering buying Long Term Care insurance .
    - 70 % of people who are 65 years old will need to use some type of long term
      care in their lifetime . And , as they age the likelihood of needing long term
      care will increase . The cost for this care is very expensive and it is not
      covered by conventional health insurance - commercial carriers or Medicare .
      This is because our health care system is geared to acute care not long term
      care . According to the 2015 Genworth survey the national average cost for a
      semi-private room in a nursing home is about $ 80,000 . More , for a private
      room . Home Health care costs average $ 20/hour . These expense arise when most
      people are living on a fixed income with little room for added expenses . Especially
      , unplanned ones . Baby boomers have not been great at planning for retirement
      . One year of long term care can ruin someone 's retirement plans . This is
      what happens in many cases ; families deplete their assets and end up qualifying
      for Medicaid -LRB- aka Welfare -RRB- to pay for long term care expenses . The
      question people need to ask themselves is when the need for long term care arises
      , will they have the money to pay for this care ? This is what long term care
      insurance can do for them . Insurance is the only financial vehicle that promises
      a specific amount of money at a point in time . There is no other . Even though
      this can be an expensive premium , depending on the age at which the policy
      is purchased , compared to the benefits paid , it is worth the outlay for most
      people . Not only because it will help pay the bills . Long term care insurance
      policies offer additional benefits that most people are unaware of . Most importantly
      , all carriers offer optional care management to assist with the difficult decisions
      about care , choosing facilities and offering discounts on major providers of
      care . Many times families need someone to discuss options with who is educated
      about all the options available and is n't emotionally involved with their situation
      . This is where the care manager can be of tremendous help and the family does
      not have to go to the expense of hiring a geriatric care manager . The policies
      will also pay for modifications to be made to the home to keep the person at
      home rather than moving them to a nursing home .
    - Is long term insurance a good buy ? Well it all depends on your needs and your
      assets . The big thing long term care does is provide you a pool of money to
      help you choose what you want to have happen regarding your care . Without long
      term care coverage any situation that comes up where you need care , you 'll
      be faced with where ever will take you and quite possibly a reduction in assets
      to cover the cost . The idea of long term care being a good buy is strictly
      in the eye of the beholder . For some it does n't matter and for others it is
      just a matter of plugging in the right variables to make the plan work best
      .
    - Not everyone needs long term care insurance . LTCI is not for persons who are
      struggling to meet their day to day living expenses , rent an apartment , and
      have little savings and no investments . If such a person needed to go to a
      nursing home , Medicaid will almost immediately start picking up their tab and
      they will be fine . Long term care insurance is for those who have substantial
      assets or income that they do n't want to `` lose '' by paying high long term
      care costs . Some people are OK with their savings going to long term care expenses
      , if needed . They figure that is why they saved . Others feel strongly that
      they want to pass that wealth to heirs to continue a business , care for a disabled
      adult child , or help grandchildren go to college , among a myriad of other
      reasons . It is this latter segment of the population that `` needs '' long
      term care insurance , especially if they are not so very wealthy that paying
      nursing home expenses for many years would simply dent their resources , rather
      than deplete them . If they can afford long term care insurance , but would
      not be able to to pay for long term care services , people who are adamant about
      choosing the type of care they receive , or persons who are setting up a plan
      so that their children do n't have to worry about it , also could use long term
      care insurance . As long as Medicaid is around , no one absolutely needs long
      term care insurance . But for all the reasons above , many people would consider
      it a need if they looked at it realistically .
    - Is long term care insurance really necessary ? The answer depends on you and
      what you want to happen to you in a care situation . If you want a say in where
      you go , how you are treated and what you get to keep asset wise , Long Term
      Care makes great sense . You can certainly do without it , but understand you
      give up where you go , how you 're treated and very little if any choice in
      assets you get to keep . All a long term care policy does is give you control
      over how you 're treated when you need a care situation . So no , it is not
      necessary if that does n't matter to you . If it does , then it makes great
      sense . Long term care is an either you get it or you do n't product . Most
      purchasers of long term care WANT the product , very few have to be talked into
      making a purchase . It is one the few products in insurance where you spend
      a lot of time plugging together options for people as they 've already decided
      to purchase , so the question becomes what do they want it to do ?

    - People purchase long term care insurance because they want to protect their
      assets , and because they want to be involved in the decisions about what long
      term care they receive . Having a long term care insurance policy can pay the
      insured person funds that can be used to pay for a home health aid , personal
      assistant so they can live in an independent living residence , or monthly charge
      for assisted living or nursing home . While it gives the person freedom to choose
      the care they are most comfortable with , it also allows them to hold onto their
      assets that might have to be spent on long term care , without insurance .
    - I believe you are referring to Long Term Care Insurance . There are a variety
      of different long term policies from many insurance companies . Most policies
      sold today are comprehensive and offer a daily benefit that can be used in your
      home , adult day service centers , hospice care , respite care , assisted living
      facilities and Alzheimer 's special care facilities and nursing homes . In a
      home setting , comprehensive polices generally cover skilled nursing care ,
      occupational , speech , physical and rehabilitation therapy . You can also get
      help with personal care , such as bathing and dressing . In order to receive
      long term care expense reimbursement , you need to qualify . Generally , that
      means the failure of the insured to perform 2 out of 6 of the activities of
      daily living -LRB- ADLs -RRB- . There is also an `` elimination period '' after
      which the benefits begin . Policies vary in what they actually cover and there
      is much you should know about long term care and you need to find a qualified
      insurance agent near you that can help you understand it .
    - Stand alone long term care insurance policies can be very expensive and generally
      are not a fixed premium so may well go up over time . When you purchase long
      term care as a rider on a whole life policy you will get the lowest premium
      rate for it that is available . So really then the best time to buy long term
      insurance is when you 're buying a whole life policy . If you already have a
      whole life policy without the LTC rider , you could either buy an additional
      policy or exchange your current policy for a new one and add the LTC rider .
    - My clients who are over the age of 55 pay between $ 4,000 to $ 7,000 a year
      . These are clients that have no other assets to exchange for an asset based
      long term care annuity . My other clients who have large assets will exchange
      them for a long term care annuity with guaranteed benefits , guaranteed growth
      on the principle and a guaranteed death benefit . They do not have to use the
      annuity for a specific long term care need . It is just another to pay for long
      term care without losing principle . Long term care insurance is a racket .
      The riders , the definitions and some companies just do n't have a good contract
      for those who need to pay premiums instead of exchanging assets .
    - Why ca n't we buy health insurance across state lines ? What difference would
      it really make ? Insurance pricing , what you pay is based on the cost of care
      in your zip codes . There is no saving to be had from buying in another state
      , this is a confused myth created by people who do n't understand health insurance
      . The cost of your care is priced on where you live , not where someone else
      lives . Think about it for a second and it will start to make sense . Why would
      an insurance company underprice the premium in an area where medical claims
      costs are high ?
    - 'Long-term care insurance starts becoming more pricey during the mid-fifties
      . One should seriously consider buying their long-term care insurance before
      then . However , there are many solutions to the problem of possibly needing
      to pay for high-cost , end-of-life care . A careful search on the Internet will
      show a number of ways to accommodate that risk . The National Clearinghouse
      for Long-term Care is a good place to start : WEBSITELINK'
    - Long Term Care Insurance exists to pay for the care needed when the insured
      persons can no longer take care of themselves . To receive a long term care
      benefit , they must show that they can not do at least two ADL 's -LRB- activities
      of daily living -RRB- on their own , and it is usually required that the condition
      is anticipated to last for at least 90 days . It also will pay due to cognitive
      impairment that interferes with the ability to care for themselves . Disability
      Insurance does not require that you can not care for yourself in order to start
      receiving benefits . It just requires that you can not do your job . While Long
      Term Care benefits are chosen based on the cost of health care in that region
      , Disability benefits are based on the income brought in by your job .
    - 'Im going to answer your question this way : Im going to describe for you the
      kind of person who buys life insurance and is really glad they did . They are
      happy with the policy they bought ; they are happy with the process they went
      through to get that policy ; and they are happy to tell all their friends and
      neighbors about how happy they are with the purchase :-RRB- . These are the
      qualities of a happy life insurance shopper : Quality number one : the happy
      life insurance shopper dares to care . Look , life insurance is not for you
      , right ? Its for your beneficiaries . And frankly , some people could care
      less about what happens after they die . I mean , to put it bluntly , they are
      dead , right ? Isnt that what it comes down to ? But for other people , the
      difference between being alive and being dead is not that great . I mean , you
      have spent a lifetime building something of value . Your marriage . Your family
      . Your business . Charitable causes worthy of your support . All these folks
      have become dependent on you . If you die , they could lose their economic foundation
      . But if you have insurance on your life , then they dont have to miss a dime
      . Life can go on in style for your spouse , your children , your business partners
      , your employees , and all the needy people that are being helped by the charities
      you support . If you care about these people , then life insurance can make
      sure life goes on for them , even when your life does not go on for you . Quality
      number two : the happy life insurance shopper understands that the time to buy
      is now . Everyone knows we all die sometime . For most of us , though , death
      is something that happens to someone else - until it strikes home . Maybe someone
      close to us gets really sick , or we ourselves have a brush with death that
      wakes us up . But up to that point , we just dont want to think about it . We
      also convince ourselves that if we stay in shape , eat right , manage our stress
      , and maintain a good attitude , we can forestall the inevitable . The fact
      of the matter is that if we really thought about it , there are a whole slew
      of hazards that are entirely beyond our control . Heres a few that come to mind
      : Freak household accidents . Violent crime . Natural disasters . Car crashes
      . Of course we all say that odds are against any of these happening to us .
      We even say to ourselves that we can afford to wait and buy a policy next year
      or the year after , so we can qualify for a better rate . But in the meantime
      , things can happen . And they do . All the time . Unexpectedly . If your time
      comes before you have a policy in force , then your beneficiaries lose out .
      You really cant afford to die until that coverage is in place . Quality number
      three : the happy life insurance shopper wants a guaranteed return on his or
      her money . OK . Now you know you need to get coverage in force as soon as possible
      because you never know when your time will come . The next logical question
      is : for how long do you keep the coverage in force ? Easy answer : for as long
      as you live . You know at some point you will have your last day on this earth
      , so that means you know for sure your beneficiary will get their money when
      your time comes ... ... as long as the policy is still in force . That means
      you need permanent coverage . The policy should last as long as you do . Doesnt
      permanent coverage cost more then term coverage ? Yes . Isnt term good for short-term
      needs ? Yes . Can you buy term and then purchase permanent when you can afford
      it ? Yes . Does it make sense to buy term now and then convert to a permanent
      product ? Yes . The thing is , if you dont take a long-term strategy , then
      you wont be guaranteed a payout . If you do take a long-term strategy , then
      you will . Guaranteed by a top-flight financial institution . Quality number
      four : the happy life insurance shopper knows what hes getting into . When you
      buy a house , do you expect to write a check for the purchase price agreed on
      ? Of course you do . Same when you buy a business , book a cruise , and buy
      a pair of shoes . We even demand that a grocery store clerk honors the price
      on the shelf if an item has been mislabeled . Life insurance should operate
      the same way . Hard to believe , isnt it ? All too often , a broker will submit
      an application on the hope and prayer that the applicant will be approved at
      the rate quoted . We wont know what the price really will be until you are approved
      . Yes , right , but if you go through full disclosure on a preliminary basis
      , you can become confident in what that price will be . The broker has to prequalify
      you and present carriers with thorough and accurate quote information upfront
      . They can then commit to a price , contingent upon information obtained in
      underwriting not contradicting the preliminary disclosures . You can then be
      sure of what you are buying . If you dont get prequalified , then you cant be
      sure . Simple as that . Quality number five : the happy life insurance shopper
      wants to be heard . There are a few companies out there who let consumers call
      them and buy policies . Thats nice for a tiny percentage of the zillions of
      men and women who need coverage . The rest of us need personalized service and
      a guide to walk us through the vast marketplace of potential carriers . Only
      one or two of them will be the best for us , and that broker has to lead the
      way to their doorstep . But life insurance distribution can be pretty rigid
      . The broker usually does not have direct access to the carriers . He or she
      must work through carrier general agencies who act as wholesalers of their products
      . So there is you , your broker , his or her general agent , and their carrier
      . I am sure you have played that telephone game where one person in the line
      passes down a message , and by the time it reaches the end , its completely
      different . Its the brokers job to make sure all information about you that
      is passed along the underwriting channels remains consistent and is fairly assessed
      . He or she is your advocate , and must be prepared to carry your cause over
      any and all hurdles that pop up in underwriting . And they do pop up . All the
      time . If you have been properly prequalified for coverage , then the bottom
      line is this : you should be approved at the rate quoted unless information
      arises in underwriting that is substantially different from the information
      that was disclosed on a preliminary basis . Your broker is your advocate to
      make sure that happens . In my humble opinion , this is how you buy life insurance
      . If you follow this path , you will be one happy camper :-RRB-'
    - Under Medicare any type of Home Health Care is limited . They will provide some
      skilled care on a temporary basis but Medicare generally will not pay for custodial
      care in any long term care environment . That is why it is important to carry
      some type of Long Term Care Insurance that will provide Home Health Care . Some
      policies even pay family members for providing care . A good agent who does
      long term care planning can help you find a program that will help .

    - 'How a renters policy is rated is no different than how any other homeowners
      policy is rented . There are several factors that go into the rating mechanism
      : Where you live - how far to the nearest fire station and fire hydrant The
      construction of the building - is it a brick building or a frame building -LRB-
      which do you think burns easier ? -RRB- Safety features - smoke alarms , deadbolt
      locks , fire/burglar alarms , sprinklers Your personal Property limit -LRB-
      your stuff -RRB- - the higher the values , the higher the premium Your personal
      Liability Limit - again , higher limits , higher premium Personal circumstances
      - age , credit score , claims history Renters insurance is really just a homeowners
      policy without building coverage . It ''s coverage for you and your stuff .
      The cost of renters insurance is usually much lower than a homeowners policy
      because a lot of the premium is generated by the cost of the building . Some
      guidelines to get the right renters coverage . Get a good handle on what it
      would cost to replace your stuff . A good agent can help or you can go to Allstate
      ''s website and use their tool -LRB- no , I ''m not an Allstate agent , I just
      like their tool -RRB- . Secondly , choose a higher liability limit . I usually
      quote at least $ 300,000 but prefer $ 500,000 or more . The cost is very negligible
      . Be smart , find an agent you can trust and take their advice . If you do have
      a claim , you ''ll be happy you did .'
    - Asking the question why should Renters get Renters insurance is the same as
      asking why should anyone get insurance ? The purpose of insurance is to pool
      together monies to reduce individual financial risk from unforeseen losses .
      Other than car insurance and now health insurance you do n't have to purchase
      insurance but I certainly would n't recommend it . Even if you are a millionaire
      you still need insurance . The more money you have the more money you can lose
      and the cost of insurance is minimal compared to the financial risk you face
      . Renters needs renters insurance to protect their belongings and also to provide
      liability protection for negligent acts . Renters insurance typically costs
      between $ 100 - $ 200 per year and for this cost you get coverage up to $ 25,000
      for personal property and up to $ 300,000 in liability . The real question should
      be why would n't Renters get Renters insurance .
    - When you rent your home , it might seem like you dont need insurance . If the
      building gets damaged in an accident , it will be your landlords problem , not
      yours . However , just because you are renting your home doesnt mean you dont
      have anything at stake . There are a few important reasons why you should consider
      getting renters insurance . The first reason to get renters insurance is to
      protect your belongings . Your landlords insurance only covers his property
      . It will cover repairing the building and anything he owns in your home , but
      wont cover anything you own . If your property is destroyed by a fire or someone
      breaks in and steals your valuables , youll be on you own to replace everything
      . This can easily cost you thousands of dollars out of pocket . When you have
      renters insurance , it will cover these losses . Another reason to buy renters
      insurance is to protect yourself against lawsuits . If someone has an accident
      and get badly injured in your home , you as the renter could be liable . Renters
      insurance protects you against this liability and makes sure you dont lose a
      fortune in a lawsuit . Lastly , renters insurance is very inexpensive . Many
      policies cost less than a dollar a day . This means you can get this important
      protection without having to make a big financial commitment . WEBSITELINK
    - 'I am going to take a philosophical approach to answering this question . I
      think it would help you understand the value you are getting for your dollar
      with this product . Lets suppose that you know with absolute certainty you are
      going to die next Tuesday . No doubt about it . Was definitely going to happen
      . Sad to think about , but hey - we are talking about life insurance . Now lets
      suppose that an insurance company is willing to insure you . -LRB- Yes , I know
      its crazy , but work with me here . -RRB- And lets suppose they are willing
      to offer you a $ 1 million policy . Would that be enough ? OK , lets say it
      would be . How much would you be willing to pay for that $ 1 million of coverage
      ? You know that the company is going to put out that money . The payout is guaranteed
      . And you know that the premium is going to be lower than the benefit . Even
      if you paid $ 900,000 for that $ 1 million dollar policy , you would still get
      a 10 % return on your money . By any standards , that is a good deal . If you
      had that money , no doubt you would pay it . And that would be a good deal for
      three reasons . One : your beneficiary would be getting money that was needed
      when they lose you . Two : there is an ironclad contractual guarantee from a
      very strong financial institution to give them that money . Three : the cost
      would be very reasonable and you would definitely get your dollars worth . All
      true ? So you would do everything possible to make this deal happen all because
      you know you are going to die next Tuesday . The only difference between this
      hypothetical scenario and real life is that you do not know when you are going
      to die . It could be tomorrow . It could be next Tuesday . I could be in 20
      years . You just dont know . Otherwise , all factors remain exactly the same
      : You know you are definitely going to die sometime . You know your beneficiaries
      will need the money when they lose you . There is an ironclad contractual guarantee
      from a very strong financial institution to give them that money . The cost
      would be very reasonable and you would definitely get your dollars worth . The
      moral of the story is that regardless of the cost , life insurance virtually
      all the time remains a fantastic deal . You just have to be willing to pay for
      it . The better question is : what is the value of a good life insurance policy

    - You will find renters insurance to be very inexpensive . With most companies
      renter insurance covering approximately $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 in personal contents
      and $ 300,000 in personal liability to be approximately $ 150 to $ 300 dollars
      a year which is equivalent to about $ 12.50 to $ 25 dollars a month . Depending
      on the carrier this could vary . By writing a renters policy not only are you
      getting coverage for your personal belongings but you are also getting personal
      liability coverage . Some companies also include additional coverage such as
      host liquor liability , which you would need to rent halls for events like a
      wedding or a birthday . You may also be able to schedule things such as your
      cell phone which may or may not be cheaper then purchasing the coverage from
      your cell phone carrier . You will find that if you purchase your renters policy
      through the same carrier as your auto insurance that the discount you receive
      on your auto insurance will more than pay for your renters policy . Multi-policy
      discounts with some companies can range from 5 % -20 % or possibly more , which
      can save you hundreds on your auto insurance . So be sure to talk to your insurance
      agent about writing a renters policy and what discounts are available .
    - 'Yes , Yes & Yes !!! Although Renters Insurance is designed to protect the Personal
      Belongings of the Renter , the policy also includes Personal Liability Coverage
      . There have been endless numbers of cases in Small Claims Court where there
      are issues between Landlords and Renters following damage to rental units .
      With the presence of a Renters Insurance Policy , the insurance company will
      investigate the claim and find if in fact the renter ''s negligence caused the
      loss ; if so , the damage repairs will be covered by the tenant ''s personal
      liability section of the Renters Insurance Policy . In some States , the Renters
      Insurance Policy is a requirement under the conditions of the standard rental
      agreement ; however , it is prudent of Landlords to require Renters Insurance
      . As a rhetorical question : ` Would you wish to rent your property to a tenant
      not concerned with insuring their own belongings ? '' Renters Insurance is very
      inexpensive and contrary to common belief , you do n''t have to speak to a salesperson
      to obtain a quote and buy the insurance . In many States , the minimum coverage
      is $ 10,000 or $ 15,000 of Personal Property and the policy automatically comes
      with $ 100,000 of Personal Liability . Depending on your selected deductible
      , the premium may be as low as $ 100 per year . If you are responsibly cautious
      only about the liability issue , we would recommend selecting the highest deductible
      since this will generate the lowest premium ; the deductible does n''t apply
      to the liability section . For an online free quote and online platform to buy

    - I do not see very many disadvantages to renters insurance . Lets look at the
      coverage renters insurance provides , and then we can talk about what it does
      not cover . Renters insurance is designed to cover your personal property ,
      protect you if you are sued , and pay medical bills if someone is injured on
      your property . Most people get upset when their insurance does not cover something
      . Sometimes people file claims to pay their landlord for clean up their deposit
      did not cover -LRB- this is not covered -RRB- . Some agents use renters insurance
      as an ad on coverage and they choose how much coverage without consulting your
      need . If you have renters insurance and only have $ 10k of coverage when you
      needed more you will not be paid more than the $ 10k A common deductible on
      renters insurance policies is $ 500 , and often smaller theft claims do not
      exceed the deductible . I see this a lot in personal items stolen out of vehicles
      . I think the advantages of having renters insurance far out way not having
      it . People in our society sue for a lot of different things , and protecting
      your self from being sued for Bodily Injury or Property Damage out side of your
      Auto is an essential part of creating a sound financial plan . Just make sure
      you have the proper coverage before you buy .
    - Renter 's Insurance is not required by state law , but many landlords will require
      that you carry renter 's insurance as part of your lease agreement . This is
      because Renter 's Insurance comes with liability insurance protection , so ,
      in some cases , if you damage the premises , they can collect from your Renter
      's Insurance policy . That coverage usually applies for accidentally created
      fires -LRB- for example -RRB- . Fortunately , most people can buy Renter 's
      insurance for about $ 10 - $ 12 per month -LRB- it might be less and some basic
      policies only cost about $ 5.00 / month -RRB- . Send me an email and I can get
      you a rate !
    - If you can afford a financial loss of your personal items and can easily repurchase
      what may have been lost due to a potential event such as fire , water , wind
      , theft and so on as there are many perils that are covered then renters insurance
      is not necessary . If you can absorb the costs of a potential law suit for bodily
      injury and/or property damage that can run well into the thousands or hundreds
      of thousands even if the suit is only alleged then renters insurance is not
      necessary . If you can pay your loss of use -LRB- substitute housing -RRB- if
      you are potentially displaced from your home for a loss as mentioned above then
      renters insurance is not necessary . If you said no to any of these you may
      wish to consider renters insurance . Renters insurance has to be the most affordable
      insurance on the market that covers so much for so little .
    - To the best of my knowledge renters insurance is not required by any state or
      by the federal government . Whether or not renters insurance is mandatory for
      a specific premise is solely up to the landlord or property owner . It is ultimately
      there call as to have renters insurance as a requirement of the rental agreement
      that you sign . Renters insurance is typically very inexpensive so call a local
      agent to get pricing and secure coverage .
    - I could tell you the Christmas story . About how a father or mother bought life
      insurance to protect their spouse and their children , if there were to be gone
      from them . About how the life insurance would protect their family from having
      to find a way to pay the mortgage or having to sell the house and move from
      the local school , or maybe mom having to get a new job . But the most important
      part about having life insurance is just knowing that your loved ones are protected
      should you no longer be with them . Finding the right agent to listen to you
      and find out what you need , and having the best company , one that pays claims
      quickly , will give you a sense of relief and satisfaction . That 's what having
      life insurance is all about . Gary Lane , Registered Representative , New York
      Life , 949 797 2424 . Thank you .
    - Almost all auto and homeowners insurance carriers offer renters insurance .
      If you currently have your auto insurance through a local agent contact them
      about renters insurance . They will more than likely have a product available
      . If you combine your renters and auto insurance with the same carrier you will
      more than likely receive a discount on your premiums .
    - This is an interesting question . Select ahigh limit of liability . Nothing
      will ruin your day like a nasty lawsuit . Consider the limits available and
      take one of the higher amounts . Since most people are thinking about their
      personal property when they buy a renters policy , remember that at the time
      of claim , identifying the losses and verifying values is critical , so pictures
      and scanned receipts can make the entire process as painless as possible . That
      is how to get the most our of your renters policy .
    - 'My first bit of advise regarding HOW one should go about buying life insurance
      is to do a little research . The better informed you are about providers and
      the types of policies , the better chances are that you ''ll get the best policy
      for your needs and goals . Of course that will necessitate that you have a good
      handle on exactly what your needs and goals are ! But there may be some living
      benefits connected to some policies that you are n''t aware of , such as the
      cash value and wealth growth potential of Whole Life with a mutual company -
      not to mention the tax benefits . So you should confer with an experienced Insurance
      Adviser who will be able to help you determine your needs and goals , answer
      questions about insurance companies you are considering , and help you to implement
      the best policy for you . One question you may find important to get the answer
      to is how the provider you ''re considering handles policy loans . For some
      enlightening information on that topic please read the article at : WEBSITELINK'
    - Travelers Insurance Company has an excellent renters insurance policy . The
      Form HO-4 covers Personal Property and Personal Liability Insurance for the
      tenant -LRB- insured -RRB- . Renters Insurance is a very valuable coverage because
      it no only offers protection against damage to your personal property but also
      protection against negligence and personal liability cases that may be brought
      against you . One valuable example is if there is fire , smoke or water damage
      to the rented home or apartment unit , the property owner 's insurance company
      will most likely attempt to collect damages from the tenant if they can prove
      negligence . In this case , Renters Insurance will provide the legal representation
      to handle the situation although the policy limit will apply . If you are not
      sure and do n't really want to commit to purchase renters insurance but may
      or may not be required to according to your lease agreement , the best way to
      generate the lowest annual premium is to select the minimum personal property
      coverage available , the lowest limit of personal liability and the highest
      available deductible for the policy . There is a link providing an online format

    - Lets suppose you own a business . Obviously you cant do everything yourself
      , so you need to hire people with special skills . Collectively you can get
      to where you want to go . The people with special skills might include a high-ranking
      executive . Might also include a highly skilled technician . Perhaps a top salesman
      . All these people play roles that are key to the operation . And you , as the
      entrepreneur of the enterprise , are very much a key person too . This is not
      to say that people who are not key do not bring value to the company and are
      not important . If all the business needed was key people , why would you hire
      anybody else ? But key people are the ones whose loss would create the biggest
      problems . Sales could go down . Vendors might not get paid . Clients might
      get nervous about orders being filled . Banks might think twice about lending
      money . You need to protect your business against the loss of these people .
      If any or all of them disappeared tomorrow , you need to be sure that your business
      can go full speed ahead . Employees , clients , prospects , vendors , lenders
      , investors , and everyone else related to your business , need to be reassured
      that business will take place as usual . And that takes money . If you have
      the exact amount of money you need exactly when you need it , then you could
      tell people to not worry . Orders will get filled . Bills will get paid . You
      can take the time needed to find the right replacement . And you dont want to
      have to set up an investment program to cover these people . Nor do you want
      to have to borrow the money . You want this coverage to come as cheaply as possible
      without any hoops to jump through . That is what life insurance does when it
      is purchased for key person coverage .
    - For the vast majority of renters , a renters insurance policy is optional .
      Some landlords will require that the tenant own a renters insurance policy and
      name them as an additional insured . It is important to note , however , that
      as a renter you are responsible for injuries and accidents that happen on the
      rented property . You are also responsible for damage to the unit and if your
      property is damaged because of a covered peril , your landlord is not responsible
      to make you whole . Those are things that a renters policy does .
    - Renters Insurance can be purchased Online ! Renters Insurance is designed to
      protect tenants from financial loss due to damage or theft of Personal Property
      and protection from cases of Personal Liability . In order to obtain a quick

    - The amount of life insurance needed is really only limited by the income and
      assets being protected , insurability and the capacity to pay premiums . The
      maximum coverage most insurers will consider for someone under age 45 will be
      25 times earned income . The earned income multiples grade down as you age .
      At older ages , net worth plays a bigger role in establishing maximum coverage
      . As for who would `` need '' the most , consider that ultra high net worth
      individuals will continue to buy life insurance for estate planning purposes
      as their wealth grows to deal with estate liquidity issues . At some point ,
      insurer retention limits and reinsurance capacity limits are reached such that
      the theoretical limit of US life insurance coverage on an eligible life is about
      $ 250 million .
    - Those who need the greatest amount of life insurance are those who would have
      the greatest losses , numerically speaking , if they passed . Persons with very
      high incomes would need a very high amount of life insurance to replace their
      income in the event of their deaths . Owners of a highly valued business could
      purchase a very large policy to buy out the share of another owner who passes
      . A son could take out life insurance on his father so that he is able to purchase
      his father 's ranch when his father passes . Of course , needing a great amount
      of life insurance does not make the need any more important than for those who
      need lesser amounts . Sometimes $ 10,000 can mean as much to one beneficiary
      as $ 1,000,000 can mean to another .
    - This is a great question . The amount of insurance that a person needs is completely
      up to them . I have clients that want a low amount of coverage just to assure
      that they are buried properly and then I have clients that want half a million
      or more to assure that the house and cars are paid off and that the children
      are taken care of in the event of their death .

    - 'Video Transcript : Who has the greatest need for life insurance ? Everybody
      that has beneficiaries that they want to indemnify , cover , or protect from
      their own indebtedness . Maybe you have a mortgage ; maybe you have credit card
      debt or auto debt . You may have future obligations like college or retirement
      . Whatever you want to protect , you want to be able to make sure your beneficiaries
      receive the tax-free benefit of life insurance proceeds to take care of those
      obligations so that they ''re not saddled and suffer through financial liabilities
      that you incurred or you created . Remember , just a heads up ; you may even
      want to create this for charitable intent . Whatever your reasons are , who
      has the greatest need ? People have the greatest exposure .'
    - Those who have the greatest need for life insurance are people with few assets
      , but many financial responsibilities . In other words , if they died , the
      loss of their income would leave a gaping hole in the financial welfare of those
      they left behind , because there would be nothing else to replace it . Life
      insurance is a low cost way of covering that need .
    - The greatest exposure a renter has is personal injury by someone visiting the
      unit that you have rented . A lawsuit is a terrible thing and the expense can
      be devestating . The second greatest loss would be to have your personal property
      destroyed . The landlord is not responsible for your personal property so if
      coverage is desired , a renters policy is the way to provide that coverage
    - Medical care has a price . In the open market it is fixed by consumers who want
      a service and medical personnel who can deliver the service . The problem occurs
      when someone needs the treatment but can not or will not pay the price for the
      service . I say , Will not because every decision about spending is discretionary
      . Should society as a whole bear the responsibility for the medical care for
      every resident ? Should the nature of that care be regulated ? Should the source
      of funding be general ? Those are the most pressing questions when considering
      a universal health care system . Ultimately in a universal health care system
      there is a specified list of services and a funding mechanism that is not based
      upon need for medical services . You may need a procedure that isnt covered
      in the program . At the same time you might consider another procedure immoral
      or frivolous . Who is going to decide ? The idea of universal health care sounds
      very good until you understand that some medical services will probably not
      be covered . In the USSR dental hygiene consisted of inserting a fluorescent
      tube into the patients mouth and surgery was routinely conducted in a super-cold
      environment because anesthesia was not readily available . In that case , most
      Americans would consider the health care to be inadequate . However , it was
      available to all and at little or no direct cost to the consumer . Under most
      regimes universal health care becomes rationed health care . The best example
      is the army under war time conditions . It is called triage but it means that
      you treat those with the greatest likelihood of recovery before treating soldiers
      with graver injuries . While it might be the best utilization of manpower ,
      the soldier with his leg blown off , might not like the wait and a narcotic
      shot is not going to make his family happy . The issue of who is going to pay
      for the universal health care system is the most sensitive . No one wants to
      see others in need . By the same token no one wants to pay the high bill for
      medical treatment . If the universal care is funded by general funds from taxes
      it will always be a political football . If it is paid by premiums paid by individuals
      there will always be a need to assist those unable to pay the premium . The
      problem really boils down to our expectations of treatment level , the availability
      and cost of that treatment and who is going to pay the price . Yes , it sounds
      like a great idea but it has many difficulties and when it is expected then
      the society will start to question the need for universal flat screen TVs ,
      micro-wave ovens and wall-to-wall carpets . There really isnt an end unless
      you look at the Soviet Union and see how it ended .
    - 'The typical profile of a life insurance owner is someone who is a family breadwinner
      and has minimal savings . In other words , has dependents and debt . Term life
      insurance is by far the most appropriate kind of life insurance for the majority
      of people . Advantages of term life insurance - Generally lower cost than permanent
      insurance . - Offers higher coverage at a more affordable price . - Gives you
      the most coverage for the lowest cost - up to 30 years . - Ideal for younger
      families when the need for protection is greatest . People choose term life
      Insurance for covering specific needs that will disappear with time , such as
      : - Income replacement - Financial security for dependents - Mortgage protection
      - College funding - Final/burial expenses Use a needs life insurance calculator
      and get online quotes so that you can compare rates from top rated companies
      to get the lowest price . Important note : Beware of sites that ask you for
      your contact information before you can see quotes .'
    - Universal life insurance is a great option for the client who wants more protection
      than is offered by term , but does not want to go to the expense of a whole
      life policy . It gives the client the greatest amount of permanent death benefit
      for the least amount of cost .
    - There are several things to consider when purchasing life insurance . The first
      is insurable interest . Who stands to lose financially if you died today ? A
      spouse , children , loved one or even business partner ? Who would be left owing
      your debt or who depends upon your income ? Once you answer this question ,
      next is how much is needed to satisfy this debt or income replacement ? Now
      how long would it take to cover this loss ? In other words , how long do you
      need to repay that debt or how long until your partner or loved one could earn
      their own income ? Once you have the answers to these questions it will become
      clear how much life insurance you need and how long do you need to carry it
      . I recommend using an experienced independent life insurance broker that can
      shop the market to find you the best coverage at the best price to cover your
      unique situation .
    - The amount and type of life insurance you need depends on what you want your
      life insurance to accomplish . If it is for a temporary need such as getting
      your kids through college or paying off your house , a Term policy is a reasonably
      priced way of getting that amount of coverage . If you want to pay for your
      funeral , a smaller , Whole Life or Guaranteed No Lapse Universal Life policy
      would be a better choice . You should work with an agent you trust to consider
      your needs , and who will shop among multiple choices to find your best price
      for the best policy to suit those needs .
    - You need disability insurance as `` paycheck protection '' . You should look
      at your current monthly budget and determine what needs to be covered if you
      were to lose your paycheck due to an accident or illness . 1 in 4 20 year olds
      will go on disability before they retire from work . You should look at the
      your expenses and determine what is the net amount of income that I could get
      by on . Many people have disability insurance through their employeer . You
      have to be careful because this policy is usually paid `` pretex '' and is taxed
      upon your drawing income . You need to check your employeers policy to determine
      what your benefits are for disability . Business Owners can get a disability
      policy to pay for their business income . What would happen to your business
      if you could not do what you do daily to generate income . Would you need to
      hire somebody ? You can get a policy to cover this . Would your business stop
      working and revenue dries up ? You may be able to cover this . You need to work
      with an independent agent to compare the rates and benefits of multiple companies
      as they treat each situation different . An example would be a Physician who
      might be offered more income during their disability with a particular company
      . You would need to check to see if you receive benefits if you can not work
      your current profession versus working at anything . All paychecks need protection
      . You should have your evaluated and deceide how you would do if you became
      disabled .
    - Which life insurance is better , Term or Whole Life ? It is a debate that has
      great points on both sides . In reality , most people need more life insurance
      than they can afford to purchase in Whole Life , but they do n't need that large
      amount of coverage for a lifetime . Term life is an economical choice for large
      amounts of coverage for relatively short amounts of time . On the other hand
      , most people need a small amount of final expense coverage , and this can not
      be Term insurance or there is a risk of it not being in effect at the time of
      death . Also , Whole Life can be used for estate planning , business succession
      , and other permanent needs that justify the higher premium , especially when
      , as Ted stated , cash value builds up to offset it . There is no one right
      answer for everyone , but there are many choices . A good agent will guide you
      to find the best policy or policies for your unique needs , desires , and budget
      .
    - The BEST life insurance product is the one that meets your needs . Therefore
      , you must ask yourself ; What is the goal ??? Term and Permanent insurance
      are two different products for two completely different needs . Term insurance
      is a product for just that , a fixed term , with either a level premium for
      the selected term or an increase annual payment if you were to choose renewable
      term . Since the contract isfor a fixed period of time , premiums are typically
      a portion of what the same coverage would be with a Permanent product as there
      are no cash accumulation or surrender features , making it affordable for those
      who need it . Regardless , term insurance is great for those with a need for
      coverage in the event of a loss of life , for a fixed term , i.e. the income
      or performance of the insured will be relied on by others . Additionally , term
      insurance is a great way for families with a limited income , to protect and
      provide for the family and young children in the event of the loss of the family
      breadwinner or equally important , the caregiver -LRB- many `` breadwinners
      '' undervalue the benefit provided by the stay-at-home spouse and over look
      childcare costs ! -RRB- which will help with living and education expenses for
      the surviving family . In the future , these young families can always re-analyze
      goals and needs and when their income allows , and convert to a permanent product
      . Term is also very useful for businesses to protect themselves against the
      loss of production and revenue in the event of a death of a key employee . This
      type of insurance planning called Key-man coverage , is cost affordable when
      using term insurance . Lastly , many of the attractive riders that are issued
      with permanent life policies can also be issued with term policies . Permanent
      insurance is a product with virtually infinite uses depending on your needs
      . Permanent life insurance products are just that , permanent for the life of
      the insured , so long as the owner has paid a sufficient amount of premium to
      maintain the coverage . In comparison to term , permanent life insurance is
      more expensive in order to account for the cost of insurance in later years
      of the insureds life . However , there are multiple advantages to buying permanent
      coverage as soon as you can afford it when you are younger . Aside from a lower
      level premium amount to carry the policy to maturity , more time will allow
      for a larger accumulation of cash value in the policy . This cash value , accumulating
      at a tax-deferred rate that beats current treasuries , can also be accessed
      through policy loans and withdrawals in the event of emergency cash needs ,
      can be used as collateral for business or personal loans and can also be used
      to support you during retirement , assuming that the need for coverage has been
      reduced . There are two main forms of permanent coverage , Whole Life products
      and Universal Life products , each with their own attractive features including
      dividends , increasing death benefit , flexible premiums and crediting rates
      indexed to stock market performances . Before making the decision to purchase
      either , be sure to sit down for a -LSB- typically free -RSB- consultation with
      a licensed life insurance agent who will help you identify both your short term
      and longer term needs and goals . Together , you should be able to put together
      an effective plan that will blend affordability and proper protection to meet
      your life insurance needs .
    - It is really not the person being insured who needs life insurance . Rather
      , it is those they leave behind . If you have dependents who would suffer financially
      if you were to pass away , you probably need life insurance . If you owe money
      that your dependents would have a hard time paying off , you probably need life
      insurance to pay off that debt or mortgage . Many people feel they have their
      affairs in order without the need of life insurance . The problem is , disasters
      or tragedies can chip away at those funds , and what you had hoped to be there
      , can be depleted before death occurs . That is where having at least some life
      insurance is necessary for most people .
    - Who needs permanent life insurance ? People with permanent needs . I.e. needs
      that will not end after a certain number of years . No one knows for certain
      when death will occur , so funeral expenses will need to be covered by permanent
      life insurance if the goal is to pay off the funeral with life insurance . Leaving
      an inheritance to children or grandchildren will require permanent life insurance
      . If you have Term insurance , pass away after it expires , and can not qualify
      for or afford a new policy , the money you planned to leave your family will
      be gone . Most people do n't need all their life insurance in permanent policies
      , because some of their life insurance needs will be temporary . But when the
      need will not go away until death , permanent life insurance is the only sure
      solution .
    - 'This is one of the most commonly asked questions about life insurance . I agree
      with Larry that there is no specific answer . Most studies suggest many have
      no life insurance at all and of those who do , many are underinsured . We often
      meet with clients who have less than one times their current annual income .
      Insurance companies generally approve coverage amounts up to 25X income -LRB-
      under age 45 -RRB- . There are many calculators online which can help such as
      this one : WEBSITELINK But there is no substitute for an experienced life insurance
      professional who can help you plan to have the right amount based on need and
      budget and can adjust the plan over time to meet changing needs .'

    - Medicare standard is primary to Tricare in all cases . Medicare Part D , if
      you elect it is also primary to Tricare . If you have a Medicare Advantage plan
      , let both Tricare and your MA know about the other , and they will organize
      the coordination of benefits . One important thing to remember is that , if
      you have Medicare Part A and Tricare , in most cases you will also have to be
      enrolled in Medicare Part B to keep the Tricare coverage .
    - If you are eligible for premium-free Medicare Part A , you must have both Part
      A and Part B to continue to receive TRICARE . Once you start receiving Part
      A and B , you start receiving TRICARE benefits under TRICARE for Life -LRB-
      TFL -RRB- . There is no advantage for most TRICARE recipients to enroll in Medicare
      Part D because TFL 's drug benefits are so comprehensive .
    - When you have original Medicare -LRB- Medicare Part A & Part B -RRB- and TRICARE
      , Medicare is the primary insurance . TRICARE pays second -LRB- the idea being
      to lower your out of pocket expenses -RRB- . Please note , I believe you have
      to have both Part A & Part B of Medicare to keep TRICARE benefits when you go
      on Medicare , but you should double-check with the plan to be 100 % sure . I
      hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me via my profile

    - Tricare is never primary over Medicare . It will only pay after all other insurances
      have paid . If you have Tricare and are entitled to Part A , you must have Part
      B to continue the Tricare pharmacy benefits . However you do not have to enroll
      in a Part D prescription plan . If you do choose to enroll in a Part D plan
      , Tricare will be secondary to that plan as well .
    - Tricare , formerly known as CHAMPUS , provides civilian benefits for military
      personnel , and their dependents . Tricare for Life -LRB- TFL -RRB- was designed
      to offer secondary coverage to Medicare for all who have Medicare Part A and
      Part B . There are very few ways one can have Tricare without having Part B
      . Here is a helpful link to explain TFL and Medicare . WEBSITELINK
    - Active military and National Guard are covered by TRICARE , a health care program
      for service members and their families around the world . TRICARE is the major
      part of the Military Health System , a system that utilizes combined resources
      of military hospitals and clinics with civilian health care networks , as well
      as a combination of different coverage options depending on where the person
      is currently stationed . TRICARE coverage does meet the requirements for having
      minimum essential benefits as called for under the Affordable Care Act .
    - Tricare , formerly known as CHAMPUS , is a health care program of the U.S. Dept
      of Defense Military Health System . TFL , Tricare for Life , offers secondary
      coverage to Medicare for all beneficiaries who have both Medicare Parts A and
      B . There are very few incidences where one can get this coverage without having
      Part B , and those incidences are temporary .
    - Most branches of the Military on on TriCare and it covers anything medically
      necessary . Without understanding the specifics being asked here and not having
      enough room to write everything that 's covered ... this type of group plan
      will cover any and all medically necessary services that are n't excluded in
      the policies limitations and exclusions . TriCare is excellent coverage if you
      have access to it .
    - Only you can answer that question . Figure your fixed costs after retirement
      , your plans -LRB- do you plan to travel ? -RRB- , and other individual factors
      . Also deduct out social security if you want to figure out how much additional
      savings you need to meet your goal . My opinion is at least 80 % of current
      income on average but that is not written in stone , every case is different
      . Sit down with a good agent familiar with retirement planning . He or she can
      help you put together a good plan for a comfortable retirement .
    - Yes it is legal , all insurance is regulated by the state insurance commissions
      , so anything Allstate is doing has been approved by them . First thing you
      should do now is contact a local independent agent and have them quote you with
      multiple carriers that can compete for your business . Typically the insurance
      companies are going to want your home and auto bundled together . This also
      gives you the most discount opportunities . Every insurance company will work
      with your mortgage company to get the premium paid .
    - 'This is a relatively subjective question . There are many companies that sell
      some form of Critical Illness . A question I would ask if you were working with
      me is are you looking for a stand-alone policy or a policy that has more value
      as in attached to your Life Insurance ? I recommend three different companies
      , Assurity Life , Mutual of Omaha and Transamerica which depending on what you
      are looking for , which is a bigger question . I would contact an agent or you
      can reach out to me and I can put together a quote for you . Matt - -LRB-720-RRB-708-5498
      or email me at : matt@pegasusii.com'
    - None that I know of will underwrite a mentally impaired person . It goes back
      to basic contract law and both parties being of sound mind to contract together
      . In fact when dealing with seniors these days an agent must be sure the senior
      is of sound mind when doing any financial work . Often , a agent will include
      family members of the client in the discussion . Dementia is something that
      can come on quickly and courts have ruled against agents who may have sold products
      to seniors who not much later on , suffered from dementia .
    - Great question ! Unfortunately , unless the person to be insured is very young
      -LRB- think under 16 -RRB- they are going to have to sign the application as
      the `` insured '' . The laws governing the issuing of insurance were set up
      especially to prevent person A from taking out a policy on person B without
      them being aware , to protect person B. I 'd be happy to explain in more detail
      if you 'd like , just contact me . I 'd suggest the best solution is that you
      work out whatever issues there are with dad , and proceed together . Thanks
      for asking !
    - The cheapest long term care insurance company in Colorado varies according to
      the person who is applying . Some companies are better at older ages ; some
      are better for couples . Some are better for -LRB- or are the only ones that
      will take -RRB- certain health conditions . Some offers certain features at
      a lower price than others . To find the cheapest long term care insurance for
      you , contact an agency that sells a variety of long term care companies in
      Colorado and review your health and all the features offered with a knowledgeable
      agent . Together , you can work out which has the lowest price for what you
      qualify for and what you need .
    - Work with a good independent agent that can show you what the current cost of
      care is in your area . For example , I would put together figures that would
      show you what the average cost of home healthcare , assisted living and a nursing
      home would run . I would then take those numbers into account when preparing
      a long term care insurance benefits package . Since you will not need the care
      for several years you need to have a plan that factors in future inflation .
    - Home fire insurance works on the basis of shared risk . An insurance company
      brings together people with similar risks so that they can share losses if there
      are any . Since such a group would have houses of different values , locations
      , and exposures , the company uses statistics and experience to develop rates
      that would apportion the risk to the various houses . If in a particular pool
      the total exposure or risk is $ 1 billion dollars , your portion of the actual
      risk might be only $ 700 .
    - To add to both I would suggest by passing the underwriting all together and
      go for a Group Policy that I offer to individuals through a membership . You
      must be working 30 hours or more per week , and live in the USA and it is available
      in all but 4 states . You can have up to $ 100,000 and it is only graded for
      one year and to give you an idea of the cost for a 49 year old it would be $
      88.55 per month for $ 100,000 in coverage . Contact me for more information
      .
    - Life insurance pricing appears to be wildly different and yet it is working
      with exactly the same mortality experience and with interest and expenses that
      are remarkably similar . What you really end up comparing is length of coverage
      . You can buy a policy that will cover you for 1 year and you can buy one that
      covers you to death , regardless of when that might occur . An insurance agent
      is the best source of information about life insurance policies . After listening
      to you , offering financial advice they should be able to put together exactly
      the policy that you need at the price you can afford .
