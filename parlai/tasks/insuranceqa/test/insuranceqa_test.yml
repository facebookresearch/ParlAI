      be long term disability coverage in many case the employer will offer both but

      only be up to 90 day less if you have long-term Di which kick in after 6 month
      12 month , etc. what be you go do before you start get a benefit last statistically

      you be if you leave your job whether voluntarily not these benefit do not follow
      you so consider get something in place at minimum so you be not leave hanging
