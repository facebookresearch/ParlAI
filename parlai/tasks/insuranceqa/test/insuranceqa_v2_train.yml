    - 'Not generally . There are five states that require most all employers carry
      short term disability insurance on their employees . These states are : California
      , Hawaii , New Jersey , New York , and Rhode Island . Besides this mandatory
      short term disability law , there is no other legislative imperative for someone
      to purchase or be covered by disability insurance .'
    - Life insurance unlike health insurance is not required by law . There are scenarios
      where life insurance can be required such as a loan institution requiring you
      to carry a life insurance policy large enough to cover the debt in case of death
      . There are scenarios in court cases such as a divorce where life insurance
      is court ordered to cover alimony or child support . But over all unlike health
      insurance on the federal side of the law and car insurance on the state side
      of the law , life insurance is not required by law .
    - 'There are five states that have mandatory disability insurance laws . These
      states are : California , Hawaii , New Jersey , New York , and Rhode Island
      . The exact provisions of these mandatory disability insurance laws varies by
      state . You can obtain additional specific information about your state ''s
      mandatory disability insurance law by checking with the states department of
      insurance -LRB- aka insurance commissioner ''s office -RRB- .'
    - Unlike auto insurance Homeowners insurance is not required by any law . However
      , that does n't mean that you 're not required to carry it . I know that sounds
      contradictory , but there 's a significant distinction . Even though you 're
      not required by law to carry it , you may be required by contract , namely a
      mortgage , to carry at least a minimum of coverage . When you purchase a home
      with a mortgage , the mortgage company will require you to carry coverage that
      will repair or rebuild your home to certain standards . The mortgage company
      is simply protecting the asset you 're using as collateral for the loan . If
      you own your home outright , you not required to insure it at all . Why someone
      would n't protect their biggest asset is a mystery to me , but it could happen
      . Be smart . find an agent you can trust . He/she will be able to help you get
      the coverage you need at a price you can afford .
    - That is really a question for lawyer or a law enforcement officer . I would
      say though that if the state that you reside in a state that requires every
      driver to have auto insurance coverage then I believe it would be a crime .
      If your state requires all drivers to have auto insurance coverage and you are
      stopped by a law enforcement officer and found not to have the required coverage
      I believe you could incur penalties imposed by the laws within that state .
    - I do not know of any state law that requires that one have Renters Insurance
      . Certainly it is not the law of the State of Connecticut . However , the law
      does not prohibit a property owner from requiring that their tenants carry renters
      insurance . Talk to your insurance professional about your needs and seriously
      consider renters insurance for your own protection and peace of mind .
    - No , the requirement to have and maintain car insurance is not a Federal Law
      , it is however , State Law in most , if not all states now . Insurance is regulated
      by each state 's Insurance Department and the requirement to have car insurance
      is a state law that is managed and regulated by each State 's Department of
      Motor Vehicles .
    - There is no law that requires a US citizen to purchase life insurance like the
      new ACA law that requires all US citizens purchase health insurance , There
      are situations where life insurance can be required such as court ordered due
      to a divorce or child custody case or even adoptions . Also lenders such as
      mortgage companies can require a person to purchase life insurance to secure
      a large debt .
    - The important factors that will play a large role in both the cost of a DI policy
      and how meaningful the benefit will be to a individual are ; The benefit amount
      , the elimination period , the duration of the benefit period , and the way
      in which the policy defines a disability . The benefit amount , the recurring
      monthly income your disability policy pays you while you are injured , represents
      the most important aspect of the coverage . Laws in most states limit disability
      insurance benefits to two-thirds of your current gross income . While most people
      select the maximum available benefit , you can choose lower amounts if your
      personal cash reserves are sufficient to supplement disability income payments
      . After you meet the criteria and are eligible to begin receiving income from
      your disability insurance policy , the length of time you must wait before payments
      begin is called the elimination period . Most major insurance carriers offer
      the same standard elimination periods ranging from one month to one year . Longer
      periods result in lower policy premiums . Once you begin receiving payments
      from your disability policy , they will continue until you are no longer disabled
      or your benefits have been exhausted . Disability insurance policies with maximum
      benefit periods of two years or less are classified as short-term disability
      products . If you own a short-term policy , payments will continue every month
      but will cease after two consecutive years . Policies with maximum benefit periods
      beyond two years are classified as long-term disability products . The most
      common benefit period choices for long-term policies are three years , five
      years , ten years or until age 65 . Every insurance company has its own formal
      definition of a disability , and benefit payments will not start unless your
      status falls within these guidelines . Some companies define disability as an
      inability to perform any gainful income-producing work at all . Collecting benefits
      under policies purchased from these carriers often presents a significant challenge
      . Thankfully , a large percentage of carriers consider you disabled if you are
      unable to perform the substantial duties of your own current employment position
      , a policy feature commonly referred to as `` own occupation . '' If your injury
      prevents you from adequately fulfilling the requirements of your current job
      , you are eligible to begin collecting benefits after the expiry of the elimination
      period .
    - Under the mental health parity requirements of Federal law -LRB- Mental Health
      Parity and Addiction Act of 2008 -RRB- and later of ObamaCare , major medical
      plans must now cover mental health issues the same as they would treat any other
      medical condition . So , any financial requirements such as copays , deductibles
      or any treatment limitations -LRB- such as number of visits -RRB- can be no
      more restrictive for mental health or addiction than for a physical ailment
      . An important distinction that the reader should be aware of is that the 2008
      law applied to employers with 50 or more employees . Under the requirements
      of the Affordable Care Act -LRB- ObamaCare -RRB- this was extended to individual
      and small group policies sold on or after January 1 , 2014 . It is possible
      that there are existing `` grandfathered '' policies still in effect that are
      not subject to these requirements though such policies are becoming fewer and
      fewer .
    - You can not legally take out a life insurance policy on your son without his
      knowledge , if your son is an adult . The law dictates that adults have the
      right to know of , and to consent to , life insurance policies out on their
      lives . But would your son object to you taking out a policy on him ? Accidental
      death policies do not need any medical requirements , and he could get life
      insurance that would not require an exam .
    - Homeonwers insurance to best of my knowledge is not required by law within the
      United States . Your mortgage lender will normally require you to carry homeowners
      insurance in order to protect there investment . If you did not have homeowners
      insurance and were to experience a major loss this more than likelywould lessen
      your capacity to repay you debt to the lender and the property that was used
      as collateral would more than likely be lesser or non existant .
    - Life Insurance companies are formed under state laws . Each law regulates the
      activities of the insurance companies that are admitted to that state . The
      company offers to provide a guaranteed amount to a customer whose death falls
      within a certain period of time . This period of time can be a lifetime . Companies
      market their product in various ways ; however , the product is sufficiently
      complex that most people seek the advice and assistance of a state licensed
      insurance agent .
    - This is more of a family law question than a question that can be answered by
      life insurance professionals . You should contact an attorney with family law
      experience for advice . It is not unusual for divorce decrees to address and
      give direction with respect to how life insurance is to be handled .
    - The simple answer to this is the high cost of health care and prescription drugs
      . Insurance companies are forced to maintain a very small profit margin by law
      , and any rate increases must be approved by the Department of Insurance . The
      PPACA laws are going to make the situation worse for many , unfortunately .
    - The Supreme Court has ruled that the Affordable Care Act is a tax law . Under
      that law you can be fined if you do not have health insurance . There is an
      implementation schedule and dates have shifted recently . The idea was to make
      sure everyone had health insurance so I suspect that there will certainly be
      pressure on everyone to have a policy .
    - It depends on your policy and the circumstances . Rental is something you can
      add to your auto policy . It is designed to provide you with a rental car if
      you are involved in an at fault accident . If the accident is the fault of the
      other driver then generally his insurance would cover the rental . Keep in mind
      insurance laws differ in many states . Some states are what is called no-fault
      . This means that neither driver is considered at fault in the event of an accident
      and each drivers insurance would pay for their own insured . Check with you
      agent to make sure of the laws in your state .
    - The 1st thing you need to think about is what you can afford for the cost of
      insurance and also what can you afford to loose id you have inadequate coverage
      . Each state varies for the amount of liability that you are required to have
      . In Montana the limits are 25K per person -LRB- medical payment to others -RRB-
      50K per accident and 10K for property damage which if you think about it that
      is not much coverage in the event of a major accident . Then you need to take
      in the factor of uninsured and underinsured both are fairly inexpensive and
      well worth the few dollars it is a month here in our state 1 in 3 cars has no
      insurances your odds of an accident and getting hit by someone with no insurance
      is high . Laws in most states require you to have the state minimum . I recommend
      the higher limits then what state requirements are however . You also have a
      budget in mind It does no good to buy a policy with higher limits if you can
      not afford the monthly payment . So it really depends on what you can afford
      to loose and what fits your monthly budget.I recommend talking to a local agent
      and seeing what they have for rates as a independent agent can compare rates
      with many carriers and can help you muddle through the confusion .
    - This can be different state by state , but I can advise regarding Connecticut
      . If you let your car insurance lapse here , a couple of things will occur .
      First , because the CT Department of Motor Vehicles requires by law that anyone
      who registers a car here must have and maintain car insurance , such a lapse
      can cause you serious problems down the line . Here , insurance companies and
      DMV share information so when a policy lapses , DMV is notified by your insurance
      company . DMV will send a letter requiring you to provide proof that coverage
      was maintained and if you can not provide such proof , regardless ofhow long
      the lapse , you will be fairly heavily fined . Secondly , when you do decide
      to establish car insurance again , you may find that it will cost you more than
      it did before the lapse . This is because companies have underwriting requirements
      that stipulate that one must maintain continuous coverage for at least the previous
      6 monthsin order to qualify for standard rating . If that can not be proven
      , you will end up with a higher risk carrier for at least 6 months and will
      pay a much higher premium that you have been used to paying .
    - 'The answer to this question depends on the laws of the state you are from .
      If you plan non operating -LRB- PNO -RRB- and renew car registration with PNO
      fee you do n''t have to have insurance on it . The only requirement that insurance
      company may have is that your car is properly registered with DMV . For instance
      , if the car is salvaged and there is no title , you ca n''t insure it . But
      if the title was issued - you can get coverage . Here is a tricky question :
      if you own an off road mobile equipment , for instance , the one used in construction
      , and this vehicle is not designed / nor used on public roads - you are not
      required to register -LRB- i.e. forklift -RRB- . But if you cross a highway
      on a public road , than this creates a legal issue . This is a known fact .
      In the end , to answer your question more info is required . Do n''t relay on
      anything you read here .'

    - If the person who passed away was the one with the debt , creditors generally
      can not take the life insurance proceeds left as long as the beneficiary was
      a person . The money then belongs to that beneficiary , and as long as creditors
      do not have a claim against the beneficiary , they can not take life insurance
      proceeds from them .
    - Creditors can not go after the life insurance payout to pay the debts of the
      deceased insured person , as long as the beneficiary or beneficiaries who are
      receiving the life insurance proceeds are actual people . Life insurance bypasses
      probate , so the creditor does not have the opportunity to access the life insurance
      payout . If the beneficiary is the insured person 's estate , the creditors
      may be able to go after the life insurance death benefit to pay the debts of
      the insured . If the beneficiary is the one who has the debts , then the creditors
      can go after the life insurance payout . This is also true if the beneficiary
      shared a debt with the deceased .
    - Creditors can go after life insurance proceeds that are left to the estate .
      Probate is the process of administering an estate , and when the death benefit
      from life insurance is left to the estate , those funds are in the pool , and
      during probate , creditors will go after their share . If life insurance is
      left to a person as a beneficiary , that person who collects the money is not
      generally liable for paying the debts of the person who died . State laws differ
      and there are variations that can affect this , but the general rule is that
      creditors for the deceased can not go after the life insurance the deceased
      person left to you .
    - If the creditor is going after life insurance proceeds that have been left to
      the insured person 's estate , and is doing so to pay off bills left by the
      deceased , then the creditor can claim life insurance benefits during probate
      . If the beneficiary of the life insurance policy is a person , then creditors
      can not take the death benefit away from the beneficiary . There may be some
      exceptions , such as if the beneficiary was a co-signer to the debt .
    - The answer to this questions depends on a few specifics . In many states , a
      creditor can not take the cash values of a life insurance policy from a policy
      owner -LRB- this is not true of all states , however -RRB- . For death benefit
      , as long as the death benefit is paid to a beneficiary who is not a party to
      the loan for which the creditor is trying to collect money , the creditor would
      not be able to take life insurance proceeds , unless those proceeds were paid
      to the policy owner 's estate , at which point in time they would need to be
      distributed through the probate process , and the creditor would have the ability
      to file claim against the estate in an attempt to recover monies owed .
    - If the creditor is going after money owed by the insured person who passed away
      , the life insurance is exempt from creditors if the beneficiary of the policy
      was a person . Creditors can not take the life insurance proceeds from a beneficiary
      unless the beneficiary co-signed the debt with the insured person , or has debts
      of their own for which creditors are seeking payment .
    - Life insurance must be distributed to a beneficiary and not the estate to remain
      exempt from the deceaseds creditors . The beneficiaries creditors would be able
      to go after the life insurance proceeds . Most retirement accounts and cash
      value within a life insurance policy are exempt from creditors and can be retained
      , even through bankruptcy . One way creditors sometimes get to the funds is
      if life insurance proceeds are deposited into what was a joint checking account
      that the creditor had access to . While a person may be able to have the funds
      returned through legal proceedings , it is often best to close the joint account
      and open a new account .
    - If you mean can creditors , rather than debtors , take life insurance proceeds
      upon the death of the insured , they generally can not as long as the beneficiary
      of the policy is a person . If the beneficiary is the estate , creditors can
      go after the estate for payment of past debts on the part of the insured .
    - Life insurance that is left to a person as beneficiary is usually exempt from
      creditors in South Carolina . If the beneficiary has co-signed for an unpaid
      debt at the time the Insured dies , then the creditors may be able to go after
      the insurance proceeds . And if the beneficiary is the Insured 's estate , creditors
      will try to collect their due from the insurance proceeds in the estate . But
      a person who receives a life insurance death benefit is not liable for the debts
      of the Insured .
    - If the person with the debt is the person who owes money to a creditor , then
      the creditor can take life insurance proceeds if they are left to his/her estate
      . If the beneficiary is a person , the creditor can not take the life insurance
      proceeds unless the beneficiary was a co-signer to the debt .
    - 'In Canada , variable annuities are usually called segregated funds or seg funds
      . They are similar to mutual funds , but since they are issued by insurance
      companies they have certain guarantees and features . If you are looking for
      an equity investment , then segregated funds should be considered . In today
      ''s marketplace there are a wide variety of plans available with very competitive
      costs . Segregated funds are suitable for self-employed business owners and
      professionals . In addition , individuals who want to invest in equities , but
      would like maturity and death benefits guarantees . This is especially important
      if you are within 10 to 15 years of retirement or already retired . Segregated
      funds can offer : Death benefit guarantees of 100 % or 75 % Maturity guarantees
      of 100 % or 75 % Some plans offer the ability to reset or lock in market gains
      Potential creditor protection Estate planning advantages including avoiding
      probate which can save fees and provide privacy . If any of these are important
      to you then , you should consider segregated funds . More information is available
      at www.ProtectandGrow.ca If you have further questions , would like a second
      opinion , or believe I could be of assistance , please do not hesitate to contact

    - Life Insurance comes in many forms and is constantly evolving , but the bottom
      line is that Life Insurance should not be considered an investment product .
      There are types of contracts that build inside cash through variable interest
      rates or dividend structures or separate accounts , but these are side benefits
      to the most important reason to have life insurance . Life insurance provides
      some measure of financial security to your loved ones should you die too soon
      . That is it 's most important job . Keep in mind as well that Life Insurance
      proceeds pass directly to your beneficiary . They can not be attached by creditors
      nor are the direct proceeds taxable .
    - So long as there is a named beneficiary to receive the life insurance proceeds
      upon your death , those proceeds can not be attached or encumbered in any way
      by a creditor . The proceeds are also not taxable , though the interest or growth
      that invested proceeds generate are . Now , that having been said , if there
      is no beneficiary and the proceeds are paid therefore to your estate , as my
      colleague pointed out , once in the estate , they are fair game . Talk to your
      Insurance Professional regularly , perhaps once a year , to discuss any changes
      that may have happened in your life that can affect your Life Insurance . This
      is also a very good time to review your coverage to be sure it is what you need
      and that it is still accomplishing what it was indended to accomplish .
    - Provided that you have named a primarybeneficiary in your Life policy , then
      yes , the proceeds from that policy , upon your death , would pass directly
      to your beneficiary without any trouble from creditors . In addition to naming
      a beneficiary , it is also a very good idea to name a contingient beneficiary
      who would receive the proceeds if the primary benficiary can not , for some
      reason , receive them .
    - Life insurance proceeds paid to your named beneficiary are not attachable by
      creditors nor are they taxable . Your beneficiary is under no real obligation
      to use the proceeds to pay any of your debts , however , generally speaking
      , Life Insurance planning and the resulting policy protection is put into place
      to solve problems like this at the time of death . As an example , if you have
      a $ 250,000 mortgage , and you want your family to be able to stay in your home
      without that mortgage , then the proceeds can and rightfully should be used
      to pay off the loan , as that was your intent for your family 's security .
    - If a person dies and has left no will , the estate must go through the probate
      process . This provides the beneficiaries , creditors and anyone else with a
      vested interest in the estate with a supervised place in which to distribute
      assets . Legal fees can make this a very expensive process . A life insurance
      policy is a contract that operates at the death of a person , However , the
      money is sent directly to the beneficiary . The risk is that the beneficiary
      might not be the intended beneficiary . This is a good reason to review your
      life insurance policy regularly .
    - 'In Canada , variable annuities are typically called segregated funds -LRB-
      separated from other assets of the insurance company -RRB- . They can only be
      sold by advisors licensed for life insurance . Segregated funds are similar
      to mutual funds but have special features including : Guarantees to protect
      your investment Potential creditor protection The right to name a beneficiary
      An information folder must be provided to the client before they buy . If you
      have further questions , or feel that I could be of assistance , please do not
      hesitate to contact me . If you would like to work with a local life insurance
      broker , you could start with a Google search . For example , if you search
      for : life insurance broker Halifax or life insurance agent Halifax , my name
      , along with several others , will come up . You can use the same method to
      find a life insurance broker in your community .'
    - If you were to die today , how long would your savings last ? How would your
      family pay the bills without your income ? Who will pay the debts you leave
      behind ? Life insurance provides the peace of mind and security in knowing that
      your loved ones will be able to continue on without you . They can stay in their
      home . Your child can go to college . Your final expenses will be taken care
      of . Even if you have a sizable estate , life insurance can be a means of helping
      to preserve that estate . It can hep make sure your business will continue until
      it can be sold . It can provide funds for a business partner to buy out your
      share of the business when you die . It avoids probate and creditors , unlike
      other savings vehicles . It provides an immediate estate . This is financial
      security !
    - Of course an irrevocable life insurance trust `` works '' for some things but
      not for other things . It depends what you are setting the trust up to do .
      One use is to pass money to beneficiaries and protect the funds from Medicaid
      or other creditors . If the trust is set up 5-years or more in advance , the
      money is protected by the trust and will pay to the beneficiaries upon your
      death .
    - For most of us who have been around for 25 years or more , the answer is yes
      . The life insurance industry is a great vocation . You never really understand
      your career until you deliver your first death claim to beneficiaries . The
      power of handing over a check to a widow when every other creditor is hovering
      over her is one of the greatest experiences youll ever have as an agent .

    - -- > Normal 0 While I have no intention to question a colleague , Im not sure
      I would place a Travelers Tenants policy in the Excellent column , good , maybe
      , but certainly not excellent . The Travelers tenant homeowners policy covers
      your personal property but limits that coverage to specific named perils . In
      my opinion , an excellent tenant homeowners policy would cover any direct damage
      -LRB- except for specific exclusions and limitations -RRB- . The basic Travelers
      tenants policy covers the insured for the Actual Cash Value of their property
      . An excellent policy would cover the full replacement cost of covered property
      , new for old . The Travelers tenant homeowners policy , like many others ,
      covers your personal property but limits theft coverage on Jewelry , Furs or
      Silver to , I believe , $ 1000 . An excellent policy would have either no limitations
      or the limits would be no less than $ 5000 in the aggregate for each category
      . The Travelers liability coverage excludes , as do most other tenants policies
      , property damage to property in the insureds care , custody or control . Generally
      that would include property damage to the apartment you are living in . This
      exclusion would not apply to Fire or Smoke damage but I dont believe water damage
      to the apartment you rent would be covered by the basic policy . Securing coverage
      for accidental damage to the apartment they are living in may be a very important
      coverage for most apartment renters . Obtaining a waiver from your landlord
      for any damage covered by the landlords insurance may be the best and most economical
      alternative . If buying coverage on-line or face to face from a local broker
      , I suggest these questions be raised and addressed .
    - To determine the value of a travel insurance policy review the coverage that
      you currently have . Some people have coverage that extends to the locality
      where they live , or the state in which they reside . Coverage outside of that
      specified area can be highly limited . The issue becomes more severe with most
      plans when you travel overseas . If your current coverage is inadequate to cover
      potential difficulties secure a travel insurance policy . Personally , I travel
      overseas frequently and never purchase travel insurance .
    - Most health insurance plans give some coverage overseas . The extent of the
      coverage in most cases is determined by looking at the event as life threatening.If
      that is the case , then emergency room visits would be covered.What is important
      for the traveler to know is that most doctors and hospitals in foreign countries
      want payment up front for services at the time of the visit . One instance I
      know of that happened to a traveler in Panama was a traveler went to the hospital
      and was required to pay $ 5,000 up front as a deposit before they would treat
      them . The traveler has to file claims after the fact and wait for a reimbursement
      . If you are covered by Medicaid or Medicare , there is no coverage outside
      the U.S. except Medicare will cover emergencies in Canada if they happen while
      en route to Alaska . When traveling outside the U.S. and on cruises the best
      course of action is to purchase a medical policy specifically for coverage overseas
      . These policies are very economical and offer an array of terms and choices
      . One of the most important services is to have a multilingual customer service
      agent who can help you locate medical services , deal with currency exchanges
      , manage claims and can co-ordinate services 24/7 . There are many companies
      that provide these insurance policies . I represent International Medical Group
      -LRB- IMG -RRB- who has many choices for nationals and foreign nationals that
      travel globally for business or pleasure . They have been in business for over
      twenty years and concentrate solely on this market . The United States Consular
      Bureau of Affairs also has a list of companies that provide these policies .
    - Renter 's dwelling insurance or rental dwelling insurance ? Renters insurance
      , or dwelling insurance ? There are two directions to travel on this question
      . First , renters insurance is coverage for a non-owner occupant of an apartment
      or residential dwelling . We often use the term `` tenant '' or `` renter ''
      to describe this person or family . Since the tenant does n't own the structures
      the primary objective under a tenant or renters policy is to cover their personal
      property , additional living expenses after a loss we insure , and personal
      liability . A Renters Insurance Policy -LRB- Or Tenant Insurance Policy -RRB-
      is one of the various forms of Homeowner Insurance that has been modified to
      reflect the unique needs of a non-owner occupant of residential property . Rental
      dwelling insurance is coverage purchased by the owner of the residential dwelling
      to protect their interest in an apartment or dwelling occupied by someone else
      . It is n't required that the property be non-owner occupied under such dwelling
      policies , but typically , this is the case since most homeowners insurance
      policies afford a much better coverage and premium value than a dwelling policy
      . Dwelling policies can be used in a number of circumstances from those where
      the owner occupies the property , to those where a non-owner occupant resides
      in the home . A dwelling type policy is frequently used to provide coverage
      for a dwelling in the `` course of construction '' or when it is undergoing
      significant renovation . When used in this way it is not uncommon for the policy
      to be referred to as `` builders risk '' insurance . This type of policy is
      sold to the owners of property and not to builders . Builders can obtain coverage
      for their exposures to loss in these cases from a commercial liability and property
      policy they maintain for their operations . The builder would have only a financial
      interest in the property to the extent of their unpaid work and material so
      some form of policy coverage or endorsement that extends the value of property
      and services they have installed in such a dwelling would be the best method
      of providing coverage . After all , we always have to be concerned with the
      `` insurable interest '' and the only one with a true interest to the totality
      of loss would be the property owner and not a builder or contractor .
    - Travelers Insurance Company has an excellent renters insurance policy . The
      Form HO-4 covers Personal Property and Personal Liability Insurance for the
      tenant -LRB- insured -RRB- . Renters Insurance is a very valuable coverage because
      it no only offers protection against damage to your personal property but also
      protection against negligence and personal liability cases that may be brought
      against you . One valuable example is if there is fire , smoke or water damage
      to the rented home or apartment unit , the property owner 's insurance company
      will most likely attempt to collect damages from the tenant if they can prove
      negligence . In this case , Renters Insurance will provide the legal representation
      to handle the situation although the policy limit will apply . If you are not
      sure and do n't really want to commit to purchase renters insurance but may
      or may not be required to according to your lease agreement , the best way to
      generate the lowest annual premium is to select the minimum personal property
      coverage available , the lowest limit of personal liability and the highest
      available deductible for the policy . There is a link providing an online format
      to obtain a quote and buy renters insurance online in multiple States ; may
      be used by Escrow/Closing Professionals , Mortgage Professionals , Real Estate
      Agents and directly by Consumers . An exemplary online experience for all !

    - I am going to make a different assumption from Julie on this and go with a travel
      MEDICAL insurance plan vs. auto . Travel medical insurance is designed to supplement
      your major medical or Medicare plan when you travel outside the United States
      . Most major medical plans have worldwide coverage but there are some expenses
      that are not covered by major medical . These would include med evac , translation
      of medical records and return of mortal remains . Some Medicare Advantage plans
      have out of country coverage but if you have original Medicare your out of country
      coverage is limited . It would be wise to purchase an international travel medical
      plan .
    - Travelers is often used to describe Travelers Indemnity Company . That company
      does not offer life insurance . However , Travelers Life and Annuity is a company
      that used to sell Life Insurance , and was acquired by the MetLife Life and
      Annuity Company of Connecticut in 2005 .

    - 'The simple answer is : you should pay an amount that you can afford . People
      who buy life insurance with the last dollar in their monthly budget will end
      up dropping their policy when emergencies arise . Life insurance that is dropped
      is of no value at all . Setting aside an affordable amount to pay life insurance
      premiums will help ensure that your policy is active when needed . Also , many
      people feel that if they ca n''t buy a large amount of life insurance , they
      will buy none at all . Who among us would not welcome an extra $ 10,000 of cash
      at the traumatic time of losing a loved one and trying to take time off work
      , arrange for a funeral , house relatives or travel to the location of the funeral
      ? It does not take a million dollar policy to show love for those who are left
      behind . Of course , premiums differ for different types of policies and different
      types of risk . If you are using your life insurance to provide income during
      retirement , it will take a much larger portion of your budget than if you are
      just funding your funeral . Also , life insurance for those who are older or
      of poorer health will cost more than life insurance for young , healthy persons
      . But there is also a greater chance of the death benefit being paid out sooner
      when the insured person is older or suffers from poor health . A licensed agent
      can help you look at your whole financial picture and pick out a policy that
      will meet your needs at an affordable cost .'
    - The majority of life insurance denials are a result of something found in the
      paramedical exam from the applicant ` sblood orurine testor medical history
      that is outside the life insurance company 's standards . These `` standards
      '' can vary a bit from one company to the next . The insurance company is all
      about `` risk '' and if they see something they believe is significant , they
      may deny coverage . Another option they have is to `` rate '' the individual
      below what they call `` standard '' and that move by them would make the cost
      of insurance more expensive for the applicant because the insurance company
      sees that individual as a higher risk . There areother reasons as well which
      include driving record -LRB- 2 DUI 's can be trouble here -RRB- , repeated risky
      activities such as travel to what they consider dangerous destinations in the
      world , non-sanctioned vehicle racing -LRB- cars , motorcycles , etc -RRB- and
      others . One of the best ways to help avoid a denial of life insurance coverage
      is to work with a knowledgeable life insurance agent who , based on your complete
      medical history disclosed in advance of the application , will help determine
      which life insurance company could be the most forgiving for your particular
      situation . The underwriting process for life insurance can be appealed and
      if you are working with a knowledgeable agent , they may be able to help get
      the denial reversed .
    - An auto dealership will most likely carry the insurance required to allow test
      drives . In the event of a loss/accident , the claim would fall back onto the
      insurance of the dealership . Consequently , if the insurance company is able
      to prove negligence on behalf of the driver , they may very well turn around
      and subrogate against the driver for the damages . As for personal auto policies
      , insurance will travel with the vehicle in most circumstances . If you are
      a private-seller it would be wise to check with your insurance agent prior to
      letting anyone drive your vehicle . The wording in auto policies can vary greatly
      from company to company and it is always best to err on the side of caution
      when dealing with insurance .
    - 'There are a variety of reasons why life insurance would be denied to a potential
      insured applying for coverage : Medical issues , no financial justification
      , the recreational activities are too dangerous , there is no insurable interest
      , the travel destination during the next two years is too dangerous , the driving
      record is too egregious , drug abuse , vocation hazard , etc. . There are reasons
      that a death claim would be denied like fraud or suicide in the first two years
      . In the first two years after the policy has been kept in force there is a
      contestability period for suicide , misrepresentation and fraud . Keep in mind
      that certain life insurance companys death claim due diligence processes may
      continue after the two year contestability period based on some forms of fraud
      and criminal activity surrendering the insureds death . If it feasible that
      a life insurance company to experience financial problems , fall into receivership
      of the state -LRB- a form of bankruptcy -RRB- and affect claims paying ability
      .'
    - High risk life insurance is coverage issued to persons who have a risk of passing
      away at a younger age than the general population . None of the policies I sell
      classify high risk based on occupation . A corrections officer can get the same
      rate as a business owner , as long as their health is the same . Some high risk
      policies cater to those who are overweight . Some target certain health conditions
      . Some are more favorable than other companies for those who have gone through
      treatment for substance abuse , regularly travel to foreign countries , participate
      in dangerous hobbies , or have unstable finances . To find the policy that best
      suits your particular kind of high risk , contact an impaired risk specialist
      such as myself . We have access to many different companies and can match you
      up with the one that is most lenient with your unique risk factors .
    - If you have a PPO health insurance plan you have in-network benefits as well
      as out-of-network benefits . This means that if you are traveling out of your
      home state you will have benefits which are most likely out-of-network benefits
      . Out-of-networks benefits are less than in-network benefits . For example your
      deductible may be $ 500 in-network and $ 1,000 out-of-network . In addition
      your co-insurance might be 20 % in-network but 50 % out of network . The annual
      out-of-pocket maximum would be higher also .
    - HMO stands for Health Maintenance Organization . When you are in an HMO you
      must stay in a network of doctors and health care providers , otherwise you
      are not covered unless you have an emergency . When selecting your Medicare
      Advantage Plan it is crucial that you make sure your doctors and hospitals are
      in your network . Also if you travel outside of your area for a few months out
      of the year , many Ohio residents have homes in Florida , for example and live
      in Florida during the winter , make sure your plan has a program that will allow
      you move your network to that state . United Healthcare and Aetna have such
      programs .
    - Most states require proof of car insurance in order to register your car for
      use on public roads and highways . So , if you reside in one state and have
      a car registered there , then the insurance would have to be issued from that
      state as well . Check with your Insurance Professional about the terms and conditions
      of your policy , but generally , the coverage you have in your policy will protect
      you across state lines , and into Canada . There may be limitations on travel
      to Mexico . Now , there may be other factors to consider as well . Here in CT
      , once one establishes residency , one has 30 days in order to register their
      car here . In order to register a car here , a CT issued Insurance policy will
      be required .
    labels:
    - One of the insurance carriers I represent is Travelers and yes , you can purchase
      Renters insurance through Travelers . I would look for a local agent who can
      assist you in placing a renters policy if you are interested . I am sure the
      local agent would be happy to quote Travelers if they have access and other
      carries as well .

    label_candidates:
    - Most auto dealers will not let you drive the car off of the lot unless you have
      proof of insurance if there is a loan on the car . It is never a good idea to
      drive a car without insurance . If you traded a car in , then the coverage on
      the older car may extend to the new car temporarily , but you need to call your
      agent as soon as possible and get it changed . Most dealerships have an insurance
      agent they work with who can get you coverage as well .
    - Generally speaking , probably not . Most States require you to have at least
      a mandatory minimum amount of Liability Insurance in order for a car to be registered
      . Your Car Dealership will need to obtain proof of that coverage from your Isurance
      Professional in order to register the car for you , so without such proof ,
      they ca n't really do anything to complete the deal . In addition , unless you
      are paying cash for the car , it will either be financed or leased and in both
      cases , there are requirements to have both Comprehensive and Collision coverage
      on the car and , in the case of a lease , the required amount of Liability coverage
      which is somewhat more than any State 's minimum requirement .
    - Probably not . Most states -LRB- including here in CT -RRB- require proof of
      insurance as a condition of registering your car . Dealerships will require
      that your insurance professional send them an Insurance Identification Card
      so that they can process the registration for you . Likewise , if you are either
      leasing or securing a loan to purchase your car , the financial institution
      will also require you to have the proper insurance coverage in place in order
      to finalize the sale .
    - If you have an existing auto insurance policy then you should be able to drive
      the new vehicle of the lot . You want to verify with your insurance provider
      your coverage 's . If you do not have any insurance in place do not drive the
      car anywhere until you have secured an insurance policy . Besides the fact you
      are required to have insurance to operate any motor-vehicle it would sure be
      a bummer to wreck your new car and have no coverage .
    - The answer you are looking for is no . You will not be able to take delivery
      of your newly purchased vehicle without proof of coverage for the vehicle .
      Proof of coverage is just one of the many documents that you will need to sign
      in order to complete the purchase of the vehicle to make it yours . Congratulations
      on your new vehicle !
    - DO N'T drive a new car home without insurance ! Always make sure you have active
      insurance before driving your car , especially a new car . If you lease or get
      a loan on a car the finance department usually will not let your drive off of
      the lot without proof of insurance . It depends on the state , but to my knowledge
      most states allow at least two weeks from the purchase of a new car for you
      to call your agent or carrier and update your vehicle information . During those
      two weeks the new vehicle -LRB- or newly purchased used vehicle -RRB- is typically
      considered covered . However , always update your vehicles with your agent or
      carrier asap !
    - I would like to add my two cents to this question , as Im not sure a couple
      of situations have been covered . But the question is Can I insure a car I dont
      own . If you own and insure a car , your own policy should extend your coverage
      to any car you are driving -LRB- borrowed , temporary substitute or short-term
      rental -RRB- as long as it is not another car you own or regularly use . In
      that sense , your policy then insures you driving a car you dont own . If you
      dont own a car but often drive cars you dont own and want to make sure you are
      adequately covered , you should be able to purchase a form of Drive Other Car
      coverage . Its common to see this coverage on business auto policies covering
      the business owner and family members when the business owner doesnt own a personal
      car but is provided vehicles by the company . Here again you are in a sense
      insuring a car you dont own . In my practice , I like to make sure every client
      has access to an automobile insuring agreement , as a named insured on a policy
      covering an owned car , as a spouse or family member residing in the household
      or some form of Drive Other Car coverage . I like to see adequate limits , comprehensive
      and collision and appropriate uninsured/underinsured coverage . No responsible
      adult should be without some form of auto insurance coverage ; as an owner ,
      operator , passenger or pedestrian .
    - 'Driving without car insurance can have both legal and financial impacts upon
      your life . Caveat , this is geared towards Michigan drivers . Financially :
      if you get into a collision and are negligent , you could be sued for physical
      damages to the other driver/passengers . Without insurance you will be on the
      hook for the entire judgment against you . Furthermore , if you are driving
      a new car you will either be out the money you spent on the car , or you will
      owe the leasing company or lender the value of the car . Legal : in Michigan
      driving without proof of no-fault insurance can result in a $ 500 ticket and
      three points on your license . So you will be out $ 500 immediately , and a
      huge increase in your insurance upon renewal . This is assuming you will still
      have the same insurance and not get a non-renewal notice . I hope this helps
      .'
    - Like all other types of insurance , there is no one single price for home owners
      insurance , nor is there one company that is `` best '' or `` most affordable
      '' home owners coverage for everyone . To determine the best plan for your personal
      situation , I suggest speaking with a licensed insurance agent , one who represents
      many companies in your area . It is also important to note that the cost of
      your auto insurance can vary dramatically based on a number of factors , including
      where you live , what kind of car you drive , your personal driving record ,
      and what type of coverage you want -LRB- minimum coverage to be legal to drive
      cost much less than a more comprehensive policy that provides far more coverage
      -RRB- . With property and casualty coverage such as home owners or auto insurance
      , you can normally get a better deal when purchasing coverage for more than
      one item . I have my car and my home both covered on policies with Auto-Owners
      Insurance company . With the multi-policy discounts I receive , I actually pay
      less to insure my home and car than I would pay to insure my home , if that
      was the only policy I carried with that company . While that may sound illogical
      , if not unbelievable , it is true , and is a very smart approach to take to
      make sure you keep as much as your hard earned money in your pocket as possible
      .
    - Homeowners insurance is not always cheaper than car insurance . Insurance prices
      are based on the amount of risk an insurance company is taking , which is the
      reason costs vary so dramatically . Like all other types of insurance , there
      is no one single price for home owners insurance , nor is there one company
      that is `` best '' or `` most affordable '' coverage for everyone . To determine

      minimum coverage to be legal to drive cost much less than a more comprehensive
      policy that provides far more coverage -RRB- . Likewise , the cost of your homeowners
      insurance can vary depending on the value of your home.With property and casualty
      coverage such as home owners or auto insurance , you can normally get a better
      deal when purchasing these two types of coverage from the same company . I have
      my car and my home both covered on policies with Auto-Owners Insurance company
      . With the multi-policy discounts I receive , I actually pay less to insure
      my home and car than I would pay to insure my home , if that was the only policy
      I carried with that company . While that may sound illogical , if not unbelievable
      , it is true , and is a very smart approach to take to make sure you keep as
      much as your hard earned money in your pocket as possible .
    - 'I am not a representative of State Farm as I am an independent agent . However
      , with that being said , State Farm can OFFER the ability to cover hail damage
      . Every insurance company that can protect your personal auto is able to provide
      coverage for hail damage . You are looking for a coverage called Other-than-collision
      -LRB- OTC -RRB- or sometimes called comprehensive coverage . This coverage is
      often called all-risk -LRB- a misnomer -RRB- or open-peril coverage . What the
      heck does that mean ? It means that comprehensive covers EVERYTHING to your
      auto UNLESS it says it will not cover it . This is actually very robust as a
      coverage because its impossible to list everything that can happen to a car
      for exclusions , so you can have coverage for the random things that happen
      to your car . If you look at your policy for OTC , nowhere does it mention that
      it will exclude -LRB- not cover -RRB- hail damage . This is good ; it means
      you can file a claim for OTC to repair hail damage to your auto . Here are a
      few things to understand about OTC with regards to hail damage : You have to
      pay your deductible for the repairs . Most often , this means that the insurance
      company will pay you all the money to get the car fixed EXCEPT for your deductible
      , which you then pay to the repair company that fixed you car . So if $ 3,000
      worth of repairs was needed to fix your car from hail damage , and you have
      a $ 500 deductible , then the insurance company will give you $ 2500 -LRB- $
      3,000 - $ 500 deductible -RRB- so you can pay your $ 3,000 repair bill . The
      claim settlement might happen in another way , but the logic is still the same
      . Your OTC will pay the actual cash value of the car if the repairs are over
      a certain threshold -LRB- which is determined individually for each car -RRB-
      to make the car usable again . The company can literally scrap the car and pay
      you for it instead of repairing the hail damage . Keep this in mind for when
      determining if you want to file a claim as some cars arent worth much but could
      be in EXCELLENT condition for driving . You dont want to lose your car because
      you filed a claim for cosmetic damage , or keep the car and get a salvage title
      . Talk to your agent to make sure you have OTC . Make sure that the deductible
      is an amount you can afford to pay in a reasonable amount of time . Its no good
      to have a $ 500 , $ 1000 , or $ 2,000 deductible for OTC if you can not get
      the money or put yourself in a poor financial position for 30 + days because
      of it . Sometimes paying the extra $ 5-10 per month for a lower deductible makes
      sense in households strapped for cash .'
    - Insurance Companies are trying to price a product before any one uses it and
      that is a difficult task So , things like deductibles as suggested here can
      limit your out of pocket expense in the short term , but maybe costly in the
      long run . So that is an important part of building a personal insurance program
      , but not necessarily a major piece . I never recommend reducing your limits
      . That is a drastic action and one you should avoid at all costs . For whatever
      reason you thought that was an adequate amount insurance before ; it is unlikely
      that your situation in life dictates that it no longer is necessary . Reduce
      your costs by how you drive . Many companies will give credit for substantially
      less driving . T he most correlated variable in auto insurance is actual mile
      s driven . So if you can reduce that , you should save on your auto policy .
      . Look at ride share , public transit or other ways to use your car less . If
      that is not practical look at ways you can drive safer . Be sure your air in
      your tires is correct , that you can safely see out of your side view mirrors
      , that you vision is good and that your attention to driving is foremost and
      that you are not impaired in any way including lack of sleep . Most accidents
      are caused by human error . Drive defensively !
    - This is a very hard questions to answer since each carrier from the next can
      vary so much . I have seen between different carriers as much as $ 1,000 difference
      for the same coverage . A classic example I will give one of my carriers that
      is a mutual carriers was only $ 1,000 a year with a $ 500 deductible based on
      a value of the home at $ 200,000 but the other national carrier was $ 1,400
      with a $ 1,000 deductible based off of the same value . Also you have to consider
      are they rating the home with replacement cost or actual cash value both can
      make a HUGE difference in the rating factor . There are several ways carriers
      base rates not only the value of the home but what is your home built from is
      it a log home or stick frame home . Are you in a fire area or how far are you
      away from fire department . The best thing you can do is shop with a independent
      agent they can rate it with many carriers . Also Bundling is not always the
      route either many time the home can be an excellent rate but the autos are high
      even with the discount of having both policies with the same carrier . Example
      I have found in our agency is that I have a carrier that gives you a discount
      on your auto because you own a home but the home rate is outrageous but then
      I have a different carrier for the home that does n't sell auto insurance but
      they give you a discount on the home if you insure the auto in the same agency
      and the rate is much lower then if you placed them with the same carrier all
      in one package . the key is talk to an agent who can compare rates with many
      carriers and make sure your home is valued correctly .
    - Car insurance is regulated by each state 's insurance commissioner . Therefore
      each company is going to reflect your driving record and how far you drive to
      work each day and if you use your car in your business and if you have a car
      that qualifies for discounts due to small engine or if you have the biggest
      engine and the loudest mufflers in town . Who provides the cheapest car insurance-you
      do .
    - There are many people who need auto insurance but do not own a car . Many people
      drive a company car most of the time but need to rent a car for a short period
      of time . Others do not live in the USA and need to drive a rental car when
      they return . The first place they can buy insurance is from the rental company
      . They will provide a full range of coverages . As an alternative the driver
      can carry a non-owned auto policy .
    - Boy there are any number of reasons that I can offer to illustrate why our car
      insurance , or any insurance for that matter , may go up , or down for that
      matter . Major factors in pricing usually include one 's age , drivng experience
      , driving history , claims history , etc. . You may pay more for car insurance
      in certain areas of the country than others based upon population , company
      experience within those territories etc. . Naturally another major factor is
      the year , make model and type of car that you drive and insure . Finally ,
      over the years , it has become common and accepted to include one 's credit
      history among the many factors that a company uses in order to consider and
      properly price a car insurance policy .
    - Teen drivers are among the most expensive to insure , because they have the
      most tickets and accidents . A 17 year old can reduce her auto insurance by
      1 -RRB- comparing prices , 2 -RRB- buying an older car that does not need comprehensive
      and collision -LRB- full coverage -RRB- , and 3 -RRB- by driving fewer miles
      in a year . Some kinds of cars are more dangerous and therefore more expensive
      to insure , so make sure you check insurance rates before you purchase a vehicle
      . A teen driver may also be excluded from having an insurance policy on his
      own , so it usually makes sense to join a family policy . You would also want
      to take advantage of any multi-car or multi-line discounts offered by your insurance
      company . These would be the same way that any driver can reduce her insurance
      rates , but for the teen driver it is particularly important to follow these
      steps . In addition , a clean driving record is paramount . So drive carefully
      and those rates will go down over time .
    - When you purchase car insurance the insurance agetns require that you declare
      who the primary oerator of each vehicle . This declaration means that if the
      `` driver '' of the car has an accident then the coverage of that vehicle with
      that driver was declared on the application . What happens if you are driving
      a friend 's car with his permission-then you are covered by the permission granted
      to drive the car , assuming you are legally licensed .
    - If you have an insurance policy and sell your car because you purchased a new
      car you can easily change cars on your policy . Simply call your insurance agent
      and notify them of the sale of the old car and purchase on the new car and the
      agent can update your policy . Rates will adjust to take into account the car
      you chose on a pro-rated basis .
    - -- > Normal 0 It is my understanding you will find CDW in many car rental agreements
      and it is an abbreviation for Collision Damage Waiver . When you rent a car
      , you are required to sign a rental agreement . Most renters fail to read the
      agreement but in most cases the agreement states you agree to accept full responsibility
      should the car is damaged in any way , even if that damage is not your fault
      ! For an additional daily charge , often $ 20 or more , rental companies will
      not charge you should you return their car with damage or report it stolen .
      Thats a pretty hefty charge for what many would consider one day 's comprehensive
      and collision coverage . Annualized that amounts to rental customers paying
      more than $ 7000 a year just for potential damage to the car ! Your own car
      insurance may extend to cover damage to cars you rent but check with your agent
      or insurer to make sure . Even if your insurance coverage extends to cover a
      rental car you are driving , it may not cover all the charges the rental company
      makes you responsible for . Often when signing the rental agreement , you assume
      responsibility for the loss of value to their car if it is damaged , the loss
      of rental revenue they lose while the car is being repaired and even their administrative
      costs incurred as a result of the damage . These costs are usually not covered
      by most personal auto insurance policies . And more than likely , you have given
      the rental company permission to put those charges right on your credit card
      . Be alert !
    labels:
    - Most auto dealers will not let you drive the car off of the lot unless you have
      proof of insurance if there is a loan on the car . It is never a good idea to
      drive a car without insurance . If you traded a car in , then the coverage on
      the older car may extend to the new car temporarily , but you need to call your
      agent as soon as possible and get it changed . Most dealerships have an insurance
      agent they work with who can get you coverage as well .
    - Generally speaking , probably not . Most States require you to have at least
      a mandatory minimum amount of Liability Insurance in order for a car to be registered
      . Your Car Dealership will need to obtain proof of that coverage from your Isurance
      Professional in order to register the car for you , so without such proof ,
      they ca n't really do anything to complete the deal . In addition , unless you
      are paying cash for the car , it will either be financed or leased and in both
      cases , there are requirements to have both Comprehensive and Collision coverage
      on the car and , in the case of a lease , the required amount of Liability coverage
      which is somewhat more than any State 's minimum requirement .
    - Probably not . Most states -LRB- including here in CT -RRB- require proof of
      insurance as a condition of registering your car . Dealerships will require
      that your insurance professional send them an Insurance Identification Card
      so that they can process the registration for you . Likewise , if you are either
      leasing or securing a loan to purchase your car , the financial institution
      will also require you to have the proper insurance coverage in place in order
      to finalize the sale .
    - If you have an existing auto insurance policy then you should be able to drive
      the new vehicle of the lot . You want to verify with your insurance provider
      your coverage 's . If you do not have any insurance in place do not drive the
      car anywhere until you have secured an insurance policy . Besides the fact you
      are required to have insurance to operate any motor-vehicle it would sure be
      a bummer to wreck your new car and have no coverage .
    - The answer you are looking for is no . You will not be able to take delivery
      of your newly purchased vehicle without proof of coverage for the vehicle .
      Proof of coverage is just one of the many documents that you will need to sign
      in order to complete the purchase of the vehicle to make it yours . Congratulations
      on your new vehicle !

    - Cash surrender value comes only with Whole Life Insurance , never with Term
      . It is the amount you can terminate your policy and receive . That amount includes
      both what you put in and what profit you made . The profit is taxable , just
      as most profit would be taxable . A far better idea would be NOT to surrender
      your Whole Life Policy , but instead to keep it and borrow against it and either
      then not repay it or choose to repay it as you wish . You continue to grow in
      value , even when the loan is out , and your policy stays in force , although
      the death benefit is reduced by the loan until it is paid back . There are numerous
      option you should discuss with a qualified agent . Gary Lane , Registered Representative
      , New York Life , 949 797 2424 . Call anytime . Thank you .
    - The cash surrender value in life insurance is only taxable on the amount over
      your basis . Let me explain . Basis is considered the premium you paid in .
      For example , lets say over 20 years , you paid $ 1000 per year , totaling $
      20k . In this example , the cash value is $ 35k . The taxable amount is going
      to be what you have earned over the $ 20k you put in so $ 15,000 in this example
      is taxable . Consider however not surrendering this policy but taking loans
      out instead . Loans are not taxable , do not have to be paid back although I
      would recommend doing so in many situations , and as long as you pay the premiums
      on the policy to keep it in force , you will have no tax concerns . The Key
      here is NOT to let the policy lapse . Otherwise you may have a taxable event
      if the money you took out as a loan is greater that your basis . Contact your
      agent or reach out to me if you would like to learn why I would recommend you
      pay yourself back on the loan . Good Luck .
    - Whether a `` Life Insurance check '' is taxable depends on what kind of life
      insurance check it is . You did n't say if it was the death benefit proceeds
      , or if it was a cash withdrawal from the policy , or if it was a loan against
      the cash value of the policy . The payment of the death benefit to the beneficiary
      is NOT taxable . A check for a LOAN against the cash value is NOT taxable .
      However if you surrender the policy for the cash value or if you do a partial
      surrender for cash , if you receive more money than you have paid in , -LRB-
      cash basis of the policy -RRB- , then the amount in excess of premiums paid
      in WILL be taxable as ordinary income .
    - When you surrender your life insurance policy , your coverage ends and you stop
      paying premiums . The insurance company will pay the cash surrender value of
      the policy which will take a week or two . The cash surrender value is less
      than the total cash value in the early years of a policy due to a surrender
      charge which is usually a charge that decline to zero over a period of 5-20
      years , depending on the policy . Any policy loans outstanding also reduce the
      cash value . If you have any gain in the policy - cash surrender value less
      premiums - then it will be taxable as income .
    - 'When you say NWML , I assume you are referring to Northwestern Mutual Life
      . Since I ''m not a NWML agent , it ''s hard to comment on the specifics of
      the carrier ''s product , but can hopefully provide some general insight for
      this type of program . These types of policies typically feature a combination
      structure of part whole life and part term insurance . Whole life insurance
      can not be converted to an annuity , nor can term life insurance . If the policy
      was surrendered for the cash value of the whole life side of the policy -LRB-
      term life insurance does not build cash value -RRB- , the monies could be used
      towards an annuity . Please note , if there is a loan -LRB- and any interest
      on the loan -RRB- on the policy , any remaining surrender charges , the dollar
      amount you receive can be lower than the policy ''s cash value -LRB- think :
      cash value - loans - interest on loans - surrender charges = amount you actually
      receive -RRB- . Also , you may want to verify whether there would be a taxable
      gain on the policy before surrendering it -LRB- the cash value in the policy
      exceeds the premiums paid into it -RRB- . Also , the only way a whole life insurance
      policy pays a dividend to the policyowner is if the policy is a participating
      whole life policy -LRB- non-participating policies do not offer any dividend
      structure - only the build-up of cash value -RRB- . I hope the information is
      helpful - please feel free to contact me for help and if you have any other
      questions . Thanks very much .'
    - For permanent life insurance , the policy owner has the right to borrow from
      the cash value subject to the terms in the contract . So , the owner can borrow
      life insurance cash values , even prior to age 59-1/2 , without a tax penalty
      as it is not a distribution . Loans will reduce the policys death benefit and
      cash value available for use . But use care here since if the policy lapses
      or is surrendered in full while there is an outstanding loan the amount of the
      outstanding loan is taxable to the extent that the policy 's gross cash value
      exceeds the policy owner 's basis -LRB- sum of premiums paid -RRB- in the contract
      . Policies that have a cash surrender value and have been in force for awhile
      have a maximum loanable value of close to the cash surrender value . Your annual
      statement may also have the value for loan purposes . Policies vary widely and
      there are many factors to consider . The best way to get a current value is
      to contact your life insurance professional or the insurance company directly
      .
    - Life Insurance Cash Surrender Value is what will be returned to you if you cancel
      a permanent life insurance policy that has a cash value available . This surrender
      value may be less than the actual cash value as all loans will be paid back
      & surrender fees will be taken . Beware , if the surrender value is more than
      the money or premium you have paid in , there may be a taxable event you will
      have to deal with .
    - When talking about cash value in life insurance policies it is important to
      differentiate between the policy value and the surrender value . For example
      , in a universal life insurance policy the policy value -LRB- or fund value
      -RRB- would be the accumulated cash value which is earning interest . However
      , almost all universal life insurance policies have a decreasing surrender charge
      schedule . This means that if you were to surrender the policy in the early
      years the surrender charge could reduce most -LRB- or all -RRB- of the value
      you receive . The value you would receive is called the net surrender value
      , because it is net of all charges . At some point , say 10 or 20 years down
      the road , the surrender charges will go away and the policy value will equal
      the net surrender value . This is part of the reason why cash value life insurance
      should always be looked at as a long term proposition .
    - Yes . Policy loans are an ownership right . You can borrow life insurance cash
      values , even prior to age 59-1/2 , without a tax penalty as it is not a distribution
      . Loans will reduce the policys death benefit and cash value available for use
      . But use care here since if the policy lapses or is surrendered in full while
      there is an outstanding loan the amount of the outstanding loan is taxable to
      the extent that the policy 's gross cash value exceeds the policy-owner 's basis
      -LRB- sum of premiums paid -RRB- in the contract . Policies that have a cash
      surrender value and have been inforce for awhile have a maximum loanable value
      of close to the cash surrender value . Your annual statement may also have the
      value for loan purposes . Policies vary widely and there are many factors to
      consider . The best way to get a current value is to contact your life insurance
      professional or the insurance company directly . The preceding is for planning
      purposes only and is not tax or legal advice . Consult with your tax or legal
      adviser .
    - Generally , none if proper steps are taken . Life insurance death benefit proceeds
      received by a beneficiary are income tax-free in most cases . This is a key
      feature of life insurance . Common exceptions include business-owned life insurance
      issued , or materially modified , after August 17 , 2006 which may be taxable
      unless specific steps are taken during time of application and annually thereafter
      to meet conditions which allow the proceeds to be income tax-free . Another
      exception is a tax trap where life insurance contracts with three parties involved
      may also have unexpected taxable implications . Beyond the death benefit tax-free
      characteristics , the cash values have important tax aspects as well . Cash
      value builds free of tax . If the policy-owner accesses cash values via withdrawals
      of some of the cash value -LRB- after policy year 15 -RRB- , the amounts are
      income tax-free return of basis -LRB- premiums paid -RRB- in the contract .
      After that , the gain would be income taxable . Special tax rules exist for
      distributions in the first 15 policy years . If the policy-owner accesses cash
      values by taking a policy loan , the amounts would be income tax-free . As long
      as the policy is not lapsed prior to the net death benefit being paid , the
      policy loans are never taxed . If there is a large loan and the policy is allowed
      to lapse , income tax would be due that year on all of the gain in the contract
      . In the event of a full surrender of the policy for its cash value , there
      would be income tax to the extent of gain in the contract .
    - No , Term life insurance does not usually have a cash surrender value . Term
      insurance buys pure protection rather than building up a cash value , and that
      is why the costs of Term life insurance is usually lower than policies that
      have cash value . Return of Premium -LRB- ROP -RRB- Term is one type of Term
      that could have a cash surrender value if you kept the policy long enough .
    - Cash surrender value life insurance refers to the cash build up in a permanent
      life insurance plan and not available on term policies . Permanent policies
      are known by names of whole life , universal life , indexed universal life and
      variable life . The best way to locate your exact cash value in your policy
      is to find the illustrations page located about 10 to 12 pages in your policy
      . Look at the corresponding policy year you are in and the value is out beside
      . There is no partial value for partial years . Your cash value must be calculated
      by a full policy year . Most cash value plans have no value for the first 6
      or 7 years due to all premiums paying up the death benefit or face amount .
    - The cash surrender value is the portion of your insurance that you have built
      up your own money in . Whole-life insurance by design is really like a reducing
      term policy with a cash account that builds guaranteed cash value as you get
      further and further into the policy years . All whole-life policies have a maturity
      date where your cash has built up to the point that you are completely self
      insured and the actual insured portion -LRB- the part the insurance company
      has at risk -RRB- has gone to zero . You can use your cash value while you are
      living through policy loans , cash surrenders , or using it to buy reduced paid
      up insurance .
    - Yes , you can cash out or what your referring to is surrendering the policy
      . Before you do , I would recommend that you consider a couple thoughts . First
      , if you surrender this policy , you will no longer have life insurance . Are
      you planning on replacing this policy ? Consider this carefully . Second , depending
      on how long you have had your policy , you might get some cash value paid to
      you . If there is a lot of growth , you may have to consider the tax consequenses
      as if you get back more than what was paid into the policy , the difference
      will probably create a tax burden . There are options other than surrendering
      a policy if you want the or need the cash value . Consider taking a loan or
      just withdrawing the cash value . In either case , please consult with your
      agent or broker to review all your options and any consequenses
    - The cost index that Peggy refers to above here is the Net Payment cost index
      . There is also a cost index for `` surrender value '' of a policy . The surrender
      value of a policy is based on how much premium has been paid , how much cash
      value has accumulated , and cost of insurance . The surrender value of a policy
      is paid to the policy holder when they terminate and surrender the policy .
    - Cash Surrender Value on a Life Insurance Policy will vary from company to company
      . Surrender charges can be punitive in the first 5-7 years of a policy and can
      extend out to 19 years with some companies . The account value less the surrender
      charge debited is the surrender value . Most life insurance policies are illiquid
      in the early years .
    - With Universal Life products , there are taxable events when you take withdrawals
      against the cash value , when your cash value is in excess of your policy basis
      . However , if the policy is owned and for the benefit of a person with insurable
      interest -LRB- business partner , family member or love interest -RRB- proceeds
      paid are NOT taxable . Death benefit is only taxable when it is investor owned
      .
    - What is your life insurance policy worth ? If you have Term life insurance ,
      it will only pay out the death benefit if you pass , so it does not have a cash
      value while you are alive . If you own Return of Premium Term life insurance
      , you may be able to get back some of what you paid in , if you kept it long
      enough . If you have Whole Life or Universal Life with a cash value , it is
      worth to you now the amount of the surrender value . If you surrendered it ,
      you would get that cash value . You can determine the current value by requesting
      an in force illustration from your agent of the company through which the policy
      was purchased .
    - If you leave the cash value in your policy , it grows tax deferred . If you
      take it out , or it is given to your beneficiary after death , the life insurance
      cash value that is below your policy 's `` basis '' is not considered taxable
      income . Cost basis is the premiums you paid into the policy , minus any dividends
      that may have been already paid to you . If cash value greater than basis is
      paid out , the amount above basis is taxable .
    - Cash surrender value of the policy is the asset value of a life insurance contract
      . As property , life insurance has value and is liquid . If the policy owner
      decides to `` cash in '' the policy , the insurance company will pay the cash
      surrender value to the owner within a week or two .

      to be what you have earned over the $ 20k you put in so $ 15,000 in this example
      is taxable . Consider however not surrendering this policy but taking loans
      out instead . Loans are not taxable , do not have to be paid back although I
      would recommend doing so in many situations , and as long as you pay the premiums
      on the policy to keep it in force , you will have no tax concerns . The Key
      here is NOT to let the policy lapse . Otherwise you may have a taxable event
      if the money you took out as a loan is greater that your basis . Contact your
      agent or reach out to me if you would like to learn why I would recommend you
      pay yourself back on the loan . Good Luck .
