    text: 'W: What does the term "alternative energy source" mean?

      M: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum,
      a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is
      a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water
      can all be used to create fuel.

      W: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real?

      M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum
      we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time.
      The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much
      we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around
      2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and
      availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will
      be no petroleum at this point. But it''ll become very difficult and therefore
      expensive to extract.

      W: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy
      sources?

      M: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60
      or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually.
      So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is
      that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global
      warming and the greenhouse effect.

    text: 'Paul: Sara, I''ve been looking forward to our yearly camp out for three
      weeks. [Me too] It''s going to be a wonderful day for hiking tomorrow. The great
      outdoors. Camping under the stars. This is the life.

      Sara: Yeah, but Paul, I''m a little bit worried about the weather though. The
      weatherman said it was going to rain later tonight.

      Paul: Ah, nonsense. Nothing can spoil our adventure. Those weather reports are
      never right.

      Sara: And it said there was a chance of high winds.

      Paul: Ah. Don''t worry.

      Sara: [thunder] Paul. Paul. Did you remember to bring our raincoats just in
      case, like I told you? [light rain]

      Paul: Uh ... no. I left them on the front porch. [heavy rain]

      Sara: What are we going to do now?

      Paul: We''ll have to sleep in the car! Hurry get in! [door shut]

      Sara: So, Paul, what are we going to do now?

      Paul: How about playing a card game?

      Sara: Uhh. I left them next to the picnic table. [Hmmm] Hey, you don''t want
      me to go out in this rain and get them, do you?

      Paul: No. That''s okay. So what now?

      Sara: Well, we could head down the mountain and stay at that hotel we passed
      on the way up, or go home.

      Paul: Hmm, why don''t we just make the best of it here and hope the weather
      clears.

      Sara: That''s a good idea.
