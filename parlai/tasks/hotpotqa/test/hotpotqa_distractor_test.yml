      \ In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the\
      \ State of New York.\n This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit\
      \ to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races.\n\

      \ Model Railroad \" The Union Connecting\".\n Over the next twenty years, the\
      \ Society moved from its original location to two other locations.\n Each move\
      \ doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size\
      \ of the model train layout.\n During WW2 many Society members were called to\
      \ service in the Armed Forces.\n Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had\
      \ to be dismantled.\n The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor\
      \ Building was requested for the war effort.\n The dismantling was done with\
      \ care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort.\n\
      \ As members returned after the War a new location was searched for.\n This\
      \ led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger\
      \ Terminal in Hoboken,NJ.\n They had the space for what would become the largest\
      \ model railroad in the world at that time.\n The space?\n Only the ornate waiting\
      \ room for the recently discontinued ferry boats to 23rd Street in New York\
      \ City.\n Here the layout was built.\n It was based on the Lackawanna Railroad\
