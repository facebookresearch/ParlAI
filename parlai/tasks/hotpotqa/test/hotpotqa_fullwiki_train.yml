    text: "Cadmium chloride\nCadmium chloride is a white crystalline compound of cadmium\
      \ and chlorine, with the formula CdCl.\n It is a hygroscopic solid that is highly\
      \ soluble in water and slightly soluble in alcohol.\n Although it is considered\
      \ to be ionic, it has considerable covalent character to its bonding.\n The\
      \ crystal structure of cadmium chloride (described below), composed of two-dimensional\
      \ layers of ions, is a reference for describing other crystal structures.\n\
      \ Also known are CdCl•HO and CdCl•5HO.\n\nWater blue\nWater blue, also known\
      \ as aniline blue, Acid blue 22, Soluble Blue 3M, Marine Blue V, or C.I. 42755,\
      \ is a chemical compound used as a stain in histology.\n Water blue stains collagen\
      \ blue in tissue sections.\n It is soluble in water and slightly soluble in\
      \ ethanol.\n\nDiflucortolone valerate\nDiflucortolone valerate (also \"Nerisone\"\
      \ cream/oily cream/ointment, \"Neriderm\" ointment, Japanese ジフルコルトロン (Jifurucorutoron\
      \ ) is a corticosteroid rated Class 2 \"potent\" (100-150 times) in the New\
      \ Zealand topical steroid system.\n It is a white to creamy white crystalline\
      \ powder.\n It is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in dichloromethane\
      \ and in dioxan, sparingly soluble in ether and slightly soluble in methyl alcohol.\n\
      \ Chemically, it is a corticosteroid esterified with valeric acid.\n It is commonly\
      \ used topically in dermatology.\n The brand name is Nerisone; its creams come\
      \ in potencies of 0.1% and 0.3%.\n\nHeptanoic acid\nHeptanoic acid, also called\
      \ enanthic acid, is an organic compound composed of a seven-carbon chain terminating\
      \ in a carboxylic acid.\n It is an oily liquid with an unpleasant, rancid odor.\n\
      \ It contributes to the odor of some rancid oils.\n It is slightly soluble in\
      \ water, but very soluble in ethanol and ether.\n\nMagnesium chloride\nMagnesium\
      \ chloride is the name for the chemical compound with the formula MgCl and its\
      \ various hydrates MgCl(HO).\n These salts are typical ionic halides, being\
      \ highly soluble in water.\n The hydrated magnesium chloride can be extracted\
      \ from brine or sea water.\n In North America, magnesium chloride is produced\
      \ primarily from Great Salt Lake brine.\n It is extracted in a similar process\
      \ from the Dead Sea in the Jordan valley.\n Magnesium chloride, as the natural\
      \ mineral bischofite, is also extracted (via solution mining) out of ancient\
      \ seabeds; for example, the Zechstein seabed in northwest Europe.\n Some magnesium\
      \ chloride is made from solar evaporation of seawater.\n Anhydrous magnesium\
      \ chloride is the principal precursor to magnesium metal, which is produced\
      \ on a large scale.\n Hydrated magnesium chloride is the form most readily available.\n\
      \nEthanol\nEthanol, also called alcohol, ethyl alcohol, and drinking alcohol,\
      \ is a compound and simple alcohol with the chemical formula C2H5OH .\n Its\
      \ formula can be written also as CH3 −CH2 −OH or C2H5 −OH (an ethyl group linked\
      \ to a hydroxyl group), and is often abbreviated as EtOH.\n Ethanol is a volatile,\
      \ flammable, colorless liquid with a slight characteristic odor.\n It is used\
      \ as a drug and is the principal type of alcohol found in alcoholic drinks.\n\
      \nTributyltin oxide\nTributyltin oxide (TBTO) is an organotin compound chiefly\
      \ used as a biocide (fungicide and molluscicide), especially a wood preservative.\n\
      \ Its chemical formula is <ce>[(C4H9)3Sn]2O</ce>.\n It has the form of a colorless\
      \ to pale yellow liquid that is only slightly soluble in water (20 ppm) but\
      \ highly soluble in organic solvents.\n It is a potent skin irritant.\n\nBenzamide\n\
      Benzamide is an off-white solid with the chemical formula of CHCONH.\n It is\
      \ a derivative of benzoic acid.\n It is slightly soluble in water, and soluble\
      \ in many organic solvents.\n\nGold(III) chloride\nGold(III) chloride, traditionally\
      \ called auric chloride, is a chemical compound of gold and chlorine.\n With\
      \ the molecular formula AuCl, the name gold trichloride is a simplification,\
      \ referring to the empirical formula, AuCl.\n The Roman numerals in the name\
      \ indicate that the gold has an oxidation state of +3, which is common for gold\
      \ compounds.\n There is also another related chloride of gold, gold(I) chloride\
      \ (AuCl).\n Chloroauric acid, HAuCl, the product formed when gold dissolves\
      \ in aqua regia, is sometimes referred to as \"gold chloride\" or \"acid gold\
      \ trichloride\".\n Gold(III) chloride is very hygroscopic and highly soluble\
      \ in water as well as ethanol.\n It decomposes above 160 °C or in light.\n\n\
      Chloride\nThe chloride ion is the anion (negatively charged ion) Cl.\n It is\
      \ formed when the element chlorine (a halogen) gains an electron or when a compound\
      \ such as hydrogen chloride is dissolved in water or other polar solvents.\n\
      \ Chloride salts such as sodium chloride are often very soluble in water.\n\
      \ It is an essential electrolyte located in all body fluids responsible for\
      \ maintaining acid/base balance, transmitting nerve impulses and regulating\
      \ fluid in and out of cells.\n Less frequently, the word \"chloride\" may also\
      \ form part of the \"common\" name of chemical compounds in which one or more\
      \ chlorine atoms are covalently bonded.\n For example, methyl chloride, with\
      \ the standard name chloromethane (see IUPAC books) is an organic compound with\
      \ a covalent C−Cl bond in which the chlorine is not an anion.\n\nCadmium Chloride\
      \ is slightly soluble in this chemical, it is also called what?"
