      Religious debates over the Harry Potter series Supporters of the series have
      said that the magic in "Harry Potter" bears little resemblance to occultism,
      being more in the vein of fairy tales such as "Cinderella" and "Snow White",
      or to the works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, both of whom are known
      for writing fantasy novels with Christian subtexts.

      Religious debates over the Harry Potter series Far from promoting a particular
      religion, some argue, the "Harry Potter" novels go out of their way to avoid
      discussing religion at all.

      Magical objects in Harry Potter The following is a list of magical objects used
      in the "Harry Potter" series.

      Magical objects in Harry Potter In "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix",
      Hermione Granger creates fake, enchanted Galleons that are used for communication
      between members of Dumbledore''s Army.

      Magical objects in Harry Potter Like real Galleons, the coins have numerals
      around the edge; on normal Galleons these serial numbers aren''t used the same
      way the enchanted coins are used, the numbers represent the time and date of
      the next meeting, and automatically change to match whatever numbers Harry Potter
      sets on his coin.

      Magical objects in Harry Potter Due to the coins being infused with a Protean
      Charm, once Harry Potter alters his, every coin changes to suit.

    knowledge: 'Internet access Internet access is the ability of individuals and
      organizations to connect to the Internet using computer terminals, computers,
      and other devices; and to access services such as email and the World Wide Web.

      Internet access Various technologies, at a wide range of speeds have been used
      by Internet service providers (ISPs) to provide this service.

      Internet access Internet access was once rare, but has grown rapidly.

      Internet access In 1995, only percent of the world''s population had access,
      with well over half of those living in the United States, and consumer use was
      through dial-up.

      Internet access By the first decade of the 21st century, many consumers in developed
      nations used faster broadband technology, and by 2014, 41 percent of the world''s
      population had access, broadband was almost ubiquitous worldwide, and global
      average connection speeds exceeded 1 Mbit/s.

      Internet access The Internet developed from the ARPANET, which was funded by
      the US government to support projects within the government and at universities
      and research laboratories in the US – but grew over time to include most of
      the world''s large universities and the research arms of many technology companies.

      Internet access Use by a wider audience only came in 1995 when restrictions
      on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic were lifted.

      Right to Internet access The right to Internet access, also known as the right
      to broadband or freedom to connect, is the view that all people must be able
      to access the Internet in order to exercise and enjoy their rights to freedom
      of expression and opinion and other fundamental human rights, that states have
      a responsibility to ensure that Internet access is broadly available, and that
      states may not unreasonably restrict an individual''s access to the Internet.

      Right to Internet access In December 2003 the World Summit on the Information
      Society (WSIS) was convened under the auspice of the United Nations.

      Right to Internet access After lengthy negotiations between governments, businesses
      and civil society representatives the WSIS Declaration of Principles was adopted
      reaffirming the importance of the Information Society to maintaining and strengthening
      human rights:  The WSIS Declaration of Principles makes specific reference to
      the importance of the right to freedom of expression in the "Information Society"
      in stating:  A poll of 27,973 adults in 26 countries, including 14,306 Internet
      users, conducted for the BBC World Service between 30 November 2009 and 7 February
      2010 found that almost four in five Internet users and non-users around the
      world felt that access to the Internet was a fundamental right.

      Digital divide in Canada The digital divide in Canada refers to the discrepancy
      that exists between Canadians who have access to information and communication
      technologies (ICT) and the benefits they provide compared to those who don''t.

      Digital divide in Canada This divide can be the result of many factors including
      high costs for technology and online access, differences in the availability
      of online connectivity resources in different locations across the country,
      and lacking digital literacy.

      Digital divide in Canada The digital divide in Canada also stems from income
      inequality among Canadians and differences in online connectivity practices
      exhibited by those of different age, gender, first language, and cultural background.

      Digital divide by country The digital divide is an economic and social inequality
      with regard to access to, use of, or impact of information and communication
      technologies (ICT).

      Digital divide by country Factors causing the divide can vary depending on the
      country and culture, as can the potential solutions for minimizing or closing
      the divide.

      Digital divide by country The following is a list of countries that have a digital
      divide along with contributing factors and steps the country is taking to resolve
      the issue.

      National broadband plan Broadband is a term normally considered to be synonymous
      with a high-speed connection to the internet.

      National broadband plan Suitability for certain applications, or technically
      a certain quality of service, is often assumed.

      National broadband plan For instance, low round trip delay (or "latency" in
      milliseconds) would normally be assumed to be well under 150ms and suitable
      for Voice over IP, online gaming, financial trading especially arbitrage, virtual
      private networks and other latency-sensitive applications.

      National broadband plan This would rule out satellite Internet as inherently
      high-latency.

      National broadband plan In some applications, utility-grade reliability (measured
      for example in seconds per 30 years outage time as in the PSTN network) or security
      (say AES-128 as required for smart grid applications in the US) are often also
      assumed or defined as requirements.
