      Some were abroad ; several were ill ; a few were in prison among the Saracens
      ; others were captives in the dens of ogres .

      The end of it was that the king and queen had to sit down alone , one at each
      end of a very long table , arrayed with plates and glasses for a hundred guests
      -- for a hundred guests who never came !

      `` Any soup , my dear ? ''''

      shouted the king , through a speaking-trumpet ; when , suddenly , the air was
      filled with a sound like the rustling of the wings of birds .

      Flitter , flitter , flutter , went the noise ; and when the queen looked up
      , lo and behold !

      on every seat was a lovely fairy , dressed in green , each with a most interesting-looking
      parcel in her hand .

      Do n''t you like opening parcels ?

      The king did , and he was most friendly and polite to the fairies .

      But the queen , though she saw them distinctly , took no notice of them .

      You see , she did not believe in fairies , nor in her own eyes , when she saw
      them .

      So she talked across the fairies to the king , just as if they had not been
      there ; but the king behaved as politely as if they were real -- which , of
      course , they were .

      When dinner was over , and when the nurse had brought in the baby , all the
      fairies gave him the most magnificent presents .

      One offered a purse which could never be empty ; and one a pair of seven-leagued
      boots ; and another a cap of darkness , that nobody might see the prince when
      he put it on ; and another a wishing-cap ; and another a carpet , on which ,
      when he sat , he was carried wherever he wished to find himself .

      Another made him beautiful for ever ; and another , brave ; and another , lucky
      : but the last fairy of all , a cross old thing , crept up and said , `` My
      child , you shall be too clever ! ''''

      This fairy ''s gift would have pleased the queen , if she had believed in it
      , more than anything else , because she was so clever herself .

      But she took no notice at all ; and the fairies went each to her own country
      , and none of them stayed there at the palace , where nobody believed in them
      , except the king , a little .

      But the queen tossed all their nice boots and caps , carpets , purses , swords
      , and all , away into a dark lumber-room ; for , of course , she thought that
      they were all nonsense , and merely old rubbish out of books , or pantomime
      `` properties . ''''

      With almost everything else to make them happy , they wanted one thing : they
      had no children .

      This vexed the king even more than the queen , who was very clever and learned
      , and who had hated dolls when she was a child .

      However , she , too in spite of all the books she read and all the pictures
      she painted , would have been glad enough to be the mother of a little prince
      .

      The king was anxious to consult the fairies , but the queen would not hear of
      such a thing .

      She did not believe in fairies : she said that they had never existed ; and
      that she maintained , though The History of the Royal Family was full of chapters
      about nothing else .

      Well , at long and at last they had a little boy , who was generally regarded
      as the finest baby that had ever been seen .

      Even her majesty herself remarked that , though she could never believe all
      the courtiers told her , yet he certainly was a fine child -- a very fine child
      .

      Now , the time drew near for the christening party , and the king and queen
      were sitting at breakfast in their summer parlour talking over it .

      It was a splendid room , hung with portraits of the royal ancestors .

      There was Cinderella , the grandmother of the reigning monarch , with her little
      foot in her glass slipper thrust out before her .

      There was the Marquis de Carabas , who , as everyone knows , was raised to the
      throne as prince consort after his marriage with the daughter of the king of
      the period .

      On the arm of the throne was seated his celebrated cat , wearing boots .

      There , too , was a portrait of a beautiful lady , sound asleep : this was Madame
      La Belle au Bois-dormant , also an ancestress of the royal family .

      Many other pictures of celebrated persons were hanging on the walls .

      `` You have asked all the right people , my dear ? ''''

      said the king .

      `` Everyone who should be asked , '''' answered the queen .

      `` People are so touchy on these occasions , '''' said his majesty .

      `` You have not forgotten any of our aunts ? ''''

      CHAPTER I. -LCB- Chapter heading picture : p1.jpg -RCB- How the Fairies were
      not Invited to Court .

      Once upon a time there reigned in Pantouflia a king and a queen .

      With almost everything else to make them happy , they wanted one thing : they
      had no children .

      This vexed the king even more than the queen , who was very clever and learned

      CHAPTER II .

      -LCB- Chapter heading picture : p9.jpg -RCB- Prince Prigio and his Family .

      Well , the little prince grew up .

      I think I ''ve told you that his name was Prigio -- did I not ?

      Well , that was his name .

      You can not think how clever he was .

      He argued with his nurse as soon as he could speak , which was very soon .

      He argued that he did not like to be washed , because the soap got into his
      eyes .

      However , when he was told all about the pores of the skin , and how they could
      not be healthy if he was not washed , he at once ceased to resist , for he was
      very reasonable .

      He argued with his father that he did not see why there should be kings who
      were rich , while beggars were poor ; and why the king -- who was a little greedy
      -- should have poached eggs and plum-cake at afternoon tea , while many other
      persons went without dinner .

      The king was so surprised and hurt at these remarks that he boxed the prince
      ''s ears , saying , `` I ''ll teach you to be too clever , my lad . ''''

      Then he remembered the awful curse of the oldest fairy , and was sorry for the
      rudeness of the queen .

      And when the prince , after having his ears boxed , said that `` force was no
      argument , '''' the king went away in a rage .
