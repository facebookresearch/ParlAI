      At first she would n''t go without a great deal of coaxing , but after a while
      he did n''t have to coax at all .

      She seemed to delight to be with him as much as he did to be with her .

      So Johnny Chuck grew happier and happier .

      He was happier than he had ever been in all his life before .

      You see Johnny Chuck had found the greatest thing in the world .

      Do you know what it is ?

      It is called love .

      XII JOHNNY CHUCK PROVES HIS LOVE These spring days were beautiful days on the
      Green Meadows .

      It seemed to Johnny Chuck that the Green Meadows never had been so lovely or
      the songs of the birds so sweet .

      He had forgotten all about his old friends , Jimmy Skunk and Peter Rabbit and
      the other little meadow people .

      You see , he could n''t think of anybody but Polly Chuck , and he did n''t want
      to be with anybody but Polly Chuck .

      He had even forgotten that he had started out to see the world .

      He did n''t care anything more about the world .

      All he wanted was to be where Polly Chuck was .

      Then he was perfectly happy .

      That was because Johnny Chuck had found the greatest thing in the world , which
      is love .

      But Johnny still had one great wish , the wish that he might show Polly Chuck
      just how brave and strong he was and how well he could take care of her .

      One morning they were feasting in a patch of sweet clover over near an old stone
      wall .

      It was the same stone wall in which Johnny Chuck had escaped from old Whitetail
      the Marshhawk , when Johnny was a very little fellow .

      Suddenly Polly gave a little scream of fright .

      Johnny XXXXX looked up to see a dog almost upon her .'

      ` What is it ? ''

      answered he .

      ` The ogre is coming after us .

      I saw him . ''

      ` But where is he ?

      I do n''t see him . ''

      ` Over there .

      He only looks about as tall as a needle . ''

      Then they both began to run as fast as they could , while the ogre and his dog
      kept drawing always nearer .

      A few more steps , and he would have been by their side , when Dschemila threw
      the darning needle behind her .

      In a moment it became an iron mountain between them and their enemy .

      ` We will break it down , my dog and I , '' cried the ogre in a rage , and they
      dashed at the mountain till they had forced a path through , and came ever nearer
      and nearer .

      ` Cousin ! ''

      said Dschemila suddenly .

      ` What is it ? ''

      ` The ogre is coming after us with his dog . ''

      ` You go on in front then , '' answered he ; and they both ran on as fast as
      they could , while the ogre and the dog drew always nearer and nearer .

      ` They are close upon us ! ''

      cried the maiden , glancing behind , ` you must throw the pin . ''

      So Dschemil took the pin from his cloak and threw it behind him , and a dense
      thicket of thorns sprang up round them , which the ogre and his dog could not
      pass through . ''

      I will get through it somehow , if I burrow underground , '' cried he , and
      very soon he and the XXXXX were on the other side .'

      ` Udea !

      Udea ! ''

      he cried , but she did not move or reply .

      Then he saw that she was dead , and rushed down to his brothers in the courtyard
      and called out , ` Come quickly , our sister is dead ! ''

      In a moment they were all beside her and knew that it was true , and they made
      a bier and laid her on it , and placed her across a camel , and said to the
      camel , ` Take her to her mother , but be careful not to halt by the way , and
      let no man capture you , and see you kneel down before no man , save him who
      shall say `` string '''' -LSB- 1 -RSB- to you .

      But to him who says `` string , '''' then kneel . ''

      -LSB- Footnote 1 : ` Riemen . '' -RSB-

      So the camel started , and when it had accomplished half its journey it met
      three men , who ran after it in order to catch it ; but they could not .

      Then they cried ` Stop ! ''

      but the camel only went the faster .

      The three men panted behind till one said to the others , ` Wait a minute !

      The string of my sandal is broken ! ''

      The camel caught the word ` string '' and knelt down at once , and the men came
      up and found a dead girl lying on a bier , with a ring on her finger .

      And as one of the young men took hold of her hand to pull off the ring , he
      knocked out the man-eater ''s finger-nail , which had stuck there , and the
      maiden sat up and said , ` Let him live who gave me life , and slay him who
      slew me ! ''

      And when the camel heard the maiden speak , it turned and carried her back to
      her brothers .

      Now the brothers were still seated in the court bewailing their sister , and
      their eyes were dim with weeping so that they could hardly see .

      And when the camel stood before them they said , ` Perhaps it has brought back
      our sister ! ''

      and rose to give it a beating .

      But the camel knelt down and the girl dismounted , and they flung themselves
      on her neck and wept more than ever for gladness .

      ` Tell me , '' said the eldest , as soon as he could speak , ` how it all came
      about , and what killed you . '' ''

      I was waiting in the upper chamber , '' said she , ` and a nail of the man-eater
      ''s XXXXX under my nail , and I fell dead upon the ground .'

      One day Mrs. Griggs went away from the Dale place with a very curious story
      , which she diligently spread far and wide .

      It made a good deal of talk , but people , although they listened eagerly ,
      and wondered and questioned , were rather incredulous about it .

      They thought Mrs. Griggs must be drawing considerably upon her imagination ;
      there were not lacking those who declared that she had invented the whole account
      , since her reputation for strict veracity was not wholly unquestioned .

      Mrs. Griggs ''s story was as follows : -- One day she found the door of the
      west gable unlocked .

      She went in , expecting to see bare walls and a collection of odds and ends
      .

      Instead she found herself in a finely furnished room .

      Delicate lace curtains hung before the small , square , broad-silled windows
      .

      The walls were adorned with pictures in much finer taste than Mrs. Griggs could
      appreciate .

      There was a bookcase between the windows filled with choicely bound books .

      Beside it stood a little table with a very dainty work-basket on it .

      By the basket Mrs. Griggs saw a pair of tiny scissors and a silver thimble .

      A wicker rocker , comfortable with silk cushions , was near it .

      Above the bookcase a woman ''s picture hung -- a water-colour , if Mrs. Griggs
      had but known it -- representing a pale , very sweet face , with large , dark
      eyes and a wistful expression under loose masses of black , lustrous hair .

      Just beneath the picture , on the top shelf of the bookcase , was a vaseful
      of flowers .

      Another vaseful stood on the table beside the basket .

      All this was astonishing enough .

      But what puzzled Mrs. Griggs completely was the fact that a woman ''s dress
      was hanging over a chair before the mirror -- a pale blue , silken affair .

      And on the floor beside it were two little blue satin slippers !

      Good Mrs. Griggs did not leave the room until she had thoroughly explored it
      , even to shaking out the blue dress and discovering it to be a tea-gown --
      wrapper , she called it .

      But she found nothing to throw any light on the mystery .

      The fact that the simple name `` Alice '''' was written XXXXX the fly-leaves
      of all the books only deepened it , for it was a name unknown in the Dale family
      .'

      `` Because the evening is the nicest time to tell things in .

      I only mentioned it now so that you would have something interesting to look
      forward to all day . ''''

      `` Is it about Miss Reade ? ''''

      `` Never mind . ''''

      `` I ''ll bet she ''s going to be married , '''' I exclaimed , remembering the
      ring .

      `` Is she ? ''''

      cried Felicity and Cecily together .

      The Story Girl threw an annoyed glance at me .

      She did not like to have her dramatic announcements forestalled .

      `` I do n''t say that it is about Miss Reade or that it is n''t .

      You must just wait till the evening . ''''

      `` I wonder what it is , '''' speculated Cecily , as the Story Girl left the
      room .

      `` I do n''t believe it ''s much of anything , '''' said Felicity , beginning
      to clear away the breakfast dishes .

      `` The Story Girl always likes to make so much out of so little .

      Anyhow , I do n''t believe Miss Reade is going to be married .

      She has n''t any beaus around here and Mrs. Armstrong says she ''s sure she
      does n''t correspond with anybody .

      Besides , if she was she would n''t be likely to tell the Story Girl . ''''

      `` Oh , she might .

      They ''re such friends , you know , '''' said Cecily .

      `` Miss XXXXX is no better friends with her than she is with me and you , ''''
      retorted Felicity .'
