    - 'CHOPPED is a cooking competition show that s all about skill, speed and ingenuity
      where four up-and-coming chefs compete before a panel of three expert judges
      and take everyday items and turn them into an extraordinary three-course-meal.
      Course by course, the chefs will be CHOPPED from the competition until only
      one winner remains. The challenge? They have seconds to plan and 30 minutes
      to cook an amazing course with the basket of mystery ingredients given to them
      moments before the clock starts ticking! And the pressure doesn t stop there.
      Once they ve completed their dish, they ve got to survive the Chopping Block

      criticisms! Our host, Ted Allen, leads this high energy, high-pressure show
      which will have viewers rooting for a winner and cheering for the losers. CHOPPED
      is a game of passion, expertise and skill -- and in the end, only one chef will
      survive the Chopping Block. Who will make the cut? The answer is on CHOPPED!

      Four former military service members who are pursuing culinary careers compete
      to see who will be the Chopped Champion. In the first round, a favorite American
      comfort food must mingle on the plate with a super-sweet drink, and curiously,
      three of the four competitors pull tortillas from the pantry. A patriotic pasta
      and an already-cooked savory pie are two of the mandatory ingredients in the
      entree round. Then, will the finalists be able to adeptly combine cheese and
      pudding in desserts?

      Ultimate Champions: Pros

      Four distinct groups of champs will return to the Chopped Kitchen: professionals,
      amateurs, heroes and celebrities, all leading up to a grand finale where one
      chef will seize the biggest prize in Chopped history: $50,000 and a new car!
      In this initial battle, four stellar professionals fight to see who will represent
      the pros in the finale. They have to wrangle and cook eels and figure out what
      to do with a super salty veggie for their appetizers. Then in the entree round,
      the champs have to work with a bird and a soda. And a special cheese and a creepy
      chocolate item appear in the dessert basket.

      Ultimate Champions: Amateur Champs

      Some of the most beloved amateur winners return to the Chopped Kitchen for a
      shot to compete in the $50,000 finale. In the appetizer round the competitors
      must use salsa and cheese blintzes in their culinary masterpieces. Then as the
      entree round gets started, an off-balance tug-of-war over a piece of equipment
      has everybody laughing, except for the chef who loses the fight. And grapefruit
      is among the loot the last two champs find in the dessert basket.

      Ultimate Champions: Heroes

      With two spots left in the $50,000 Ultimate Champions Grand Finale, the Chopped
      Kitchen welcomes back four incredible cooking heroes -- two firefighters, a
      police officer and an army vet. In the appetizer round, the hero champs must
      get creative in order to make savory dishes with pineapple and fruit and nut
      bars. Then in the entree round, the champs find some lovely stalks of spring
      garlic in the basket, as well as some beautiful lamb chops. And an unpleasantly
      purple ingredient that the cooks must work into a dessert makes for a challenging
      last round.

      Ultimate Champions: Celebrities

      Four Chopped Champions from the world of entertainment and sports compete for
      the last spot in the $50,000 finale. In the appetizer round, the celebrity champs
      find a peculiar type of flour and sweet tea in the baskets. Then a can of soup
      in the entree round causes various issues for the competitors. And the judges
      taste banana paste and cream cheese desserts before deciding on the last finalist.

      Ultimate Champions: Grand Finale!

      In a Chopped first, three not-at-all-average  Joes  fight it out against one
      outstanding pro, with $50,000 and a new car on the line! When the competitors
      get risotto in the first round, they have to decide whether to completely transform
      it or to greatly enhance its flavor. Then in the entree round, there s a huge
      surprise in the basket that not all of the champs are excited to see. And with
      the grand prize looming large, the last two competitors open the basket to find
      some booze and some baked goods.'

      Top 20 Favorite Types of Cuisine

      In most cultures, food is a way for people to gather. It brings family and friends
      together for banquets, potlucks and holidays. Over recent years, different cuisines
      have taken on a new popularity. Most cities now have cuisines spanning all corners
      of the globe. For new cooking ideas or restaurant options, check out some of
      these global cuisines.

      Mexican food is a common favorite cuisine in America. From chili con carne to
      enchiladas, spicy Mexican dishes are a popular choice. Western restaurants typically
      use Northern Mexican cuisine, but there are a number of other options. Ancient
      Mayan dishes have a subtler flavor while Central and Southern Mexico have a
      sophisticated taste. Restaurant goers can enjoy eggs, vegetables, beans, chilies
      and cumin in major Mexican dishes. Chocolate, tomatoes and salsa are always
      favorites as well.

      With a culinary history that stretches back centuries, Italian cuisine is one
      of the world’s favorites. Spumoni ice cream, spaghetti, lasagna and pizza are
      traditional dishes that are widely available in the United States. Beyond these
      basic dishes, there are a number of regional favorites like Parmesan cheese
      and Parma ham. One part of Italy is even known for making a kind of maggot cheese.
      The cheese is fermented and allowed to sit out so that flies lay eggs. Afterward,
      it is packed at the perfect time for maggots to develop. It might not suit everyone’s
      taste buds, but it is a specialty from the country. If this cheese is not to
      your liking, the country has more than 400 types of cheese.

      Although Italian cuisine varies from region to region, each meal will generally
      be set up in a similar way. It will begin with the antipasto or appetizer menu.
      Next, diners enjoy the primo course which consists of pasta or rice. The second
      course is a meat. To top it off, the last course is the dolce or dessert course.

      India is one of the most densely populated countries on the planet. With so
      many people within the nation, Indian cuisine is highly varied. Curries are
      the traditional fare, but Indian food is not confined for just curry. There
      are a number of regions that make vegetarian dishes, and ayurvedic medicinal
      traditions are often used in creating food. Within India, visitors will find
      a range of sweet, hot and spicy dishes. Even better, the nation is home to millions
      of street food stands. At these stands, visitors can try out unique treats for
      a very cheap price.

      Long ago, the French Acadian people had to flee Canada. Although some of the
      Acadians went back to France, others chose to move to Louisiana. Once there,
      they combined French cooking style with local ingredients. This type of cuisine
      is normally formatted within three dishes. The first pot will contain the main
      dish while another pot contains vegetables. A third pot will generally contain
      a mixture of steamed rice and seafood. Popular meat choices include pork sausage,
      shrimp and fish. Due to the area, Cajun cuisine focuses heavily on celery, bell
      peppers, garlic and onions. Other flavorings include cayenne pepper, bay leaf,
      black pepper and green onions.

      During slavery, African-American slaves were only given the leftover, unwanted
      food. Often, slave owners would try to feed them as little as possible as a
      way of saving money. This early origin caused soul food to develop. Slaves at
      the times used collards, mustard greens, turnip tops, dandelions and beets to
      make up their diet. They often were given the unwanted parts of the meat like
      offal, oxtail, pigs ears, lard and tripe. With these unwanted, inexpensive pieces,
      the slaves of the time managed to create a unique, delicious cuisine. Today,
      soul food includes dishes like chitlins, fried chicken, hog maw, pigs feet,
      fried okra, collard greens, corn bread, grits and hush puppies. After a delicious
      meal of soul food, you may not be hungry enough to eat dessert. If you are,
      you can look forward to cobbler, pecan pie or sweet potato pie.

      Over the last decade, Thai food has grown in popularity. Hands down, the most
      popular dish is pad thai. To truly experience Thai cuisine, you should step
      away from the basic pad thai and try some of the broths and noodle dishes that
      make this cuisine so delectable. This cuisine focuses on a lot of herbs and
      offers a range of sweet, sour, spicy and bitter tastes. It focuses on fresh
      herbs, so this cuisine always has a vivid flavor.

      Like Italian cuisine, Greek food dates back thousands of years. Many common
      Greek dishes have unknown origins because they have been around so long. This
      cuisine has a unique mix of different Mediterranean styles. Back in the day,
      the Greeks were well-positioned to become a major port for sea trading. Every
      time sailors returned from traveling, they brought back different dishes and
      dining styles. In Greece, visitors can expect fresh herbs, olive oil and feta.
      Due to its location near the sea, fish is a popular dining option. Pork and
      lamb are common meat choices because many of the islands are too small to host
      cattle.

      If characterizing Indian food was hard, Chinese food is impossible to pin down.
      China has one of the most diverse mixes of cultures and cuisines in the world.
      The main eight styles of cooking are: Fujian, Cantonese, Anhui, Zhejiang, Szechuan,
      Shandong and Hunan. In Chinese traditional medicine and culture, the opposites
      of yin and yang must always be kept in balance. This same balance extends to
      food. When cooking, the Chinese try to balance different colors, tastes, textures
      and smells. This focus has paid off and made Chinese cuisine one of the world’s
      finest.

      In a traditional Chinese meal, you can expect to have noodles or rice. Although
      many American-based Chinese restaurants use fried rice, most China-based Chinese
      restaurants serve basic steamed rice. With a strong Buddhist history, vegetarian
      dishes like tofu remain popular. Interestingly, garlic and chilies are considered
      non-vegetarian in Buddhism because they stimulate the chi. If you go to a Chinese
      vegetarian restaurant, don’t expect a lot of spices. For non-vegetarian dishes,
      you can expect Peking duck, thousand year old eggs, squid and a range of meat
      dishes. Vegetables are always included with dinner, and they are far from your
      mother’s broccoli. Chinese vegetable dishes are often the most delicious part
      of the meal.

      Due to its location, Lebanon has adopted Arabic and Mediterranean influences.
      Lebanese food uses a lot of fresh fruit, vegetables and seafood. Other than
      fish, it does not contain a big focus on meat. When dining at a Lebanese restaurant,
      you can expect delicious pickles, unique salads, Arabic bread, vegetable dishes
      and vegetable dips.

      The Hibachi or Teppanyaki grill are some of the most delectable of Japanese
      dining options. At a Hibachi grill, you can watch a cook flip, fry, griddle
      and cut the food in front of you. This cuisine focuses on noodles, tofu, sushi
      and vegetables. Each meal is meticulously prepared and exceptionally delicious.
      Even better, Japanese restaurants often serve oolong or green tea.

      American food is an extremely popular dining option. With so many cultures moving
      in and out of the country, American food encompasses a range of different dining
      styles. In Chicago, the deep dish pizza has become famous. Texas has five-alarm
      chili while the Pacific Northwest is home to microbreweries and coffee. At most
      traditional American diners, you can expect hot dogs, hamburgers, buffalo wings,
      biscuits & gravy and omelets.

      Expect Moroccan cuisine to become the next major hit over the coming decade.
      With such a rich history and unique dishes, this cuisine is one of the world’s
      finest. It uses Mediterranean fruits and vegetables to make spicy, flavor-filled
      meals. Lamb is a popular meat dish, and has a subtler flavor that Western lamb
      dishes. Due to its location near the sea, fish and shellfish play a strong role
      in Moroccan cuisine. Beef and chicken are commonly eaten. A local favorite is
      known as a Tagine and contains chicken, fries and olives. Many of these dishes
      are flavored with dried fruit, lemon pick and olive oil. At lunch time, Moroccans
      eat a hot or cold salad and bread. Famously, this cuisine includes couscous.
      Bread is a major dish and is known as Khobz. It varies from town to town, but
      often looks like a type of baguette. Other specialties include salted meat and
      Moroccan pancakes.

      There is some debate if there is actually a Mediterranean cuisine. This term
      mostly developed in the 1970s when there was a Mediterranean diet. In general,
      it consists of fresh fruits, vegetables, seafood and olive oil. Depending on
      who you ask, it could include different Greek, Italian, Arabic, European or
      North African dishes.

      Say Oui, Oui to French cuisine! Five-star chefs are often trained in French
      cooking. It uses cheese, chocolate and baguettes for delicious meals. Of course,
      a French meal would never be complete without some wine! Despite their focus
      on cheese, bread and chocolates, the French amazingly remain thin. Perhaps eating
      more of this cuisine could be a weight loss plan?

      Spanish cuisine is exceptional because it limits spices. Instead of hiding the
      flavor of a dish with cumin, chilies or pepper, it only uses enough spice to
      bring out the natural flavor of the food. Due to its location along the coast,
      Spanish food has a strong focus on seafood. Famously, cafes and restaurants
      in Spain offer tapas or pinches. These snack-sized dishes can be made of basically
      anything and only cost a couple of euros. Before siesta, Spaniards can stop
      in a local cafe and get a glass of wine and a tapa for merely a couple of euros.

      From sauerkraut to bratwurst, German is known for its flavorful dishes. Restaurant
      goers can expect spatzl (potatoes), rich varieties of bread, cheese and sausages.
      Even better, this country is known for its many delicious beers. Surrounded
      by the world famous cuisines of Italy, Spain and France, Germany has not gotten
      the attention it deserves from foodies.

      Many people try kimchi and give up on Korean food for good, but this cuisine
      is more than just kimchi. If you have not had this dish before, kimchi is a
      fermented cabbage dish that is mixed with vinegar and spice. Other than this
      common dish, Korean food contains rice, meat, veggies and seafood. It has a
      unique flavor that you tend to love or hate.

      Vietnamese food has not received nearly the attention it deserves. Due to the
      French colonization of the area, Vietnamese food contains traditional dishes
      and French cuisine. Visitors can enjoy vegetables, Vietnamese mint, shrimp paste,
      lime, basil leaves, soy sauce, fish sauce, fruits and vegetables in their meals.
      These meals are made to balance the five elements and tastes within the dish,
      so there is a mixture of sweet, spicy, bitter, sour and salty. Common dishes
      may include balut, duck meat or ginger.

      Coffee and chocolate are just a fraction of what Turkey has to offer. This cuisine
      has a delicious vegetable stew, eggplant dishes and seafood-based meals. Stuffed
      dolmas are always delectable and the yogurt is scrumptious. Foodies enjoy eating
      dumplings, kebabs and baklava. Olive oil is used in abundance and fresh vegetables
      are a must-have for Turkish dishes. My personal favorite is the kebab. If you
      can find a street vendor, you can watch as they peel away meat from the spit.
      You can eat it on a stick, or some street vendors will put the meat in a pita
      sandwich-like form.

      Caribbean food is a mixture of African cuisine and local delicacies. This food
      contains an impressive array of peppers and tropical fruits. From fried plantains
      to salt fish, Caribbean food is a welcome change from European and Mediterranean
      dishes. This cuisine puts a strong focus on using foods like leafy green veggies,
      goat meat, sweet potatoes, rice, peas and coconut. If you have never had Caribbean
      food, start out with a jerk chicken, goat curry and a mango salsa—you won’t
      regret it.

      I love all of those types of cuisine. 🙂 Thanks for commenting, Sylvester!

      I love the chicken

      Never tried Greek cuisine :(. Italian is my absolute favourite, but all the
      Asian styles are to die for! American cuisine? Not my cup of tea, not fond of
      fast food and super caloric drinks. Great list!

      Thank you for sharing your food likes and dislikes. It is certain that your

    - 'Types of Cuisine From Around the World With Their Popular Foods

      Most countries and regions in the world have their own particular cuisine. Different
      types of cuisines involve certain cooking practices, local ingredients, and
      a combination of spices. Some food cultures are a fusion of foods from different
      countries. From these, delicious foods have developed that provide unique culinary
      experiences.

      There are hundreds of different cuisines in the world. Famous cuisines in the
      world include French, Thai, Italian, Indian, and Chinese. In large cities, it
      is also not uncommon to find restaurants serving dishes from Moroccan, Lebanese,
      Vietnamese, and Hungarian cuisines.

      Even in countries that have their own particular kind of cuisine, it is not
      uncommon to have regional variations. For example, some types of food may be
      prepared in different ways or include a different variety of ingredients.

      In this article, you will learn about some of the top cuisines in the world.
      You will also find out where some famous dishes originated from.

      The French Provencal cuisine uses a lot of herbs

      Many regard French cuisine as one of the best cuisines in the world. French
      food involves ingredients such as butter, cream, wine, herbs, chocolate, and
      vegetables. French pastry dishes, cheese, bread, and wine are famous throughout
      the world.

      Food culture in France also revolves around locally sourced ingredients. On
      the Mediterranean coast, seafood is very popular. Provencal cuisine uses tarragon
      and a host of other herbs and spices. Paris itself has over 9,000 restaurants
      serving French classics and dishes from around the world.

      Dumplings and dim sum are a common food in the Chinese cuisine

      Chinese cuisine is one of the most diverse food cultures in the world. Traditionally,
      Chinese food is served with noodles or rice. Also, Chinese dumplings form a
      large part of the staple diet in many regions of China. There are several main
      cuisines in Chinese cookery – Cantonese, Sichuan, Fujian, and Hunan cuisines
      are the most well-known.

      Most Chinese dishes contain a mixture of vegetables that are stir-fried and
      combined with aromatic spices and herbs. For example, ginger is often fried
      along with garlic and onions to create flavorsome dishes. Also, soy sauce, rice
      vinegar, and fish sauce are commonly used to create a blend of wonderful flavors.

      Chinese cuisine could be regarded as the one of the most important in the world.
      Chinese cooking styles have influenced other foods from Korea, the Philippines,
      Thailand, and Vietnam. Chinese dishes are so popular that most cities in the
      world have a number of Chinese restaurants. Sweet and sour chicken and chop
      suey are the most popular Chinese dishes outside of China.

      Sushi is a very popular food in Japanese restaurants

      Japanese dishes have become one of the most important food genres in the world.
      Boiled rice usually accompanies most dishes with grilled fish, pickled vegetables,
      or deep-fried vegetables. Tofu also plays an important part in traditional Japanese
      cuisine.

      Of course, sushi is one of the most well-known type of Japanese food. Great
      care and precision goes into creating delicious rice rolls with raw fish, vegetables,
      and nori. These are accompanied with pickled ginger and dipping sauces. Japanese
      food culture is so influential that many countries around the world developed
      their own type of sushi varieties.

      Going into a Japanese restaurant, you often see the chef working in an open
      kitchen at a Teppanyaki grill.

      After your delicious Japanese meal, you can finish off with a cup of refreshing
      type of tea such as: green tea, oolong tea, or jasmine tea.

      Pasta dishes are one of the most famous foods in Italian cuisine

      Many people regard Italy as the country with the best food in the world. Pasta
      dishes in Italian cuisine are one of the most popular and favorite types of
      food in the world. There are very few people in the world who haven’t tried
      delicious Italian foods like pizza, spaghetti, or delicious Italian ice cream.
      Many classic Italian dishes also include the regional name in their title. For
      example, spaghetti Bolognese from Bologna and Parma ham or Parmesan cheese from
      Parma.

      The mainstays of the popular Italian cuisine are pasta, rice, tomatoes, and
      cheese. Many regional variations include types of meat, seafood, or sausages
      along with delicious sauces. These can be flavored with herbs such as oregano,
      basil, or a combination of other fresh herbs.

      There is also great variation in food cultures between the various regions of
      Italy. Abruzzo cuisine from the mountainous and coastal regions has pasta, seafood,
      lamb, and wild mushrooms. Neapolitan cuisine is famous for foods like pizzas,
      spaghetti, and mozzarella. Famous Italian dishes such as lasagna, tortellini,
      and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese are from areas around Bologna and Modena.

      Greek salad is a favorite food for Greek cuisine lovers

      Greek food culture is one of the oldest in the world. Cuisine from Greece and
      the Greek islands is heavily influenced by olive oil, vegetables, fish, and
      various types of meat. In fact, a simple Greek salad may just be fresh cucumbers,
      tomatoes, red onions, a dash of olive oil, a few tasty olives, and a thick slice
      of feta cheese.

      Some popular Greek dishes include moussaka made from eggplant, tzatziki (a type
      of yogurt dip), or gyro – a type of kebab with lamb, pork, or chicken meat.
      Due to its long coastline, seafood such as squid, mussels, fish, and lobster
      are popular food choices.

      After feasting on Greek delicacies, you may have room for some common Greek
      desserts. A delicious filo pastry with layers of nuts and honey called baklava
      is one of the most favorite Greek sweet foods.

      Seafood paella is a popular dish served in many Spanish restaurants

      Similar to many countries around the Mediterranean Sea, Spanish cuisine is heavily
      influenced by seafood. A combination of mussels, cuttlefish, shrimps, and lobster
      together with paprika, saffron and rich broth create the classic seafood paella.

      Spanish food culture isn’t limited just to seafood. This popular cuisine also
      includes foods like cured meats such as Serrano or Iberico ham. Chorizo sausage,
      mushrooms, and cooked meat are used in Spanish appetizers – tapas.

      Different regions of Spain also have culinary variations. For example, La Rioja
      is famous for its red wine, cured pork, and lamb dishes. Seafood, thyme soup,
      and bean omelets are popular in Catalan cuisine. Andalusia is famous for hot
      soups, fish stews, and cold soups such as gazpacho.

      Olive oil is a staple ingredient in the Mediterranean cuisine

      It can be difficult to define what exactly Mediterranean cuisine is as there
      is great variety of dishes in it. The key ingredients of Mediterranean cuisine
      are basic foods such as olive oil, fresh vegetables, wheat (such as bread and
      pasta), and grape (such as wine).

      Mediterranean food styles include culinary delicacies from countries such as
      Morocco, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Turkey, and the Middle East.

      Mediterranean food culture is also the basis of the Mediterranean diet. This
      kind of diet contains olive oil, fresh vegetables and fruits, seafood, and nuts.

      Hummus dip with pita bread is a common type of food served in many Lebanese
      restaurants

      Lebanese food culture comprises cuisines from other Mediterranean countries.
      Poultry, seafood, lamb, or goat meat are prepared with olive oil, garlic, and
      other spices. These are usually consumed with pitta bread and fresh or grilled
      vegetables.

      Chickpeas also form a staple part of Lebanese cuisine. These are cooked and
      blended with olive oil, tahini, and lemon juice to create a delicious nutty
      hummus dip.

      As well as classic Mediterranean desserts such as baklava or halva, fresh or
      dried types of dates are also widely used in Lebanese sweet dishes.

      A vegetable couscous is served in Moroccan tagine

      Moroccan dishes are a great example of when different cuisines fuse to form
      a new type of food genre. Moroccan cuisine uses a goat, lamb, poultry, beef,
      and seafood as its basis. These meats are spiced and cooked along with lemons,
      dried fruits, and olive oil.

      One of the most famous foods in the popular Moroccan cuisine is couscous. This
      common wheat-based food is combined with various spices, herbs, and vegetables
      to create a versatile and delicious side dish. Another favorite Moroccan classic
      dish is a tagine. This is an earthenware dish used to cook meat along with vegetables
      or dried fruits.

      As with many dishes in North Africa, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean,
      Moroccan cuisine uses flatbread as a meal accompaniment.

      Lamb kebab is a popular type of dish in the Turkish cuisine

      Turkish food is another example of a fusion of various food cultures from Asia,
      Europe, and the Middle East. Eggplant, stuffed dolmas, lamb kebabs, and delicious
      vegetable stews are just some of the culinary delights you can experience with
      Turkish food. Nuts such as hazelnuts, walnuts, and chestnuts are common food
      ingredients in savory and sweet dishes.

      One important part of Turkish cuisine is yogurt. In fact, the name ‘yogurt’
      is a Turkish word. Yogurt and types of spiced yogurt are an accompaniment to
      many vegetable and meat dishes in Turkey. Cheese made from sheep’s milk is another
      important dairy product in Turkish cuisine.

      Popular beverages in Turkey include strong Turkish coffee, hot black tea, and
      Ayran – a type of yogurt drink.

      Pad Thai is a famous and delicious dish to try when visiting Thailand

      Thai cuisine is all about strong spicy flavors that incorporate sweet, sour,
      and hot elements. Some of the world’s most popular dishes are from Thailand.
      Pad Thai, green curry, and tom yum goong are just some examples of the best
      dishes from Thailand.

      Thai food is traditionally served with rice or noodles. Even spicy Thai soups
      or broths usually contain basic rice noodles.

      One of the unique features of Thai cuisine is its wide use of spices, herbs,
      and sauces. For example, fresh basil, lemongrass, kaffir lime, chilies, and
      coconut milk are some of the ingredients in Thai green curry. Also, cloves,
      ginger, cilantro, mint, and turmeric are common ingredients.

      Trying many of the different dishes in Thailand is usually a culinary experience
      that few people forget.

      Samosas may take different fillings and forms, depending on the region in India

      When it comes to spicy, aromatic dishes, Indian cuisine usually tops the list.
      The amazing range of spices, chilies, and herbs combine to make some of the
      spiciest foods you can eat.

      In India, the range of different cuisines is also impressive. Each region in
      India has its own ethnic foods and dishes. These can include vegetable pastry
      morsels such as samosas, vegetarian curries, beans with fermented fish, and
      vegetable pakoras.

      Street food is also part of the food culture in India. Tandoori chicken served
      with basic naan bread, spicy Indian snacks, and sweet dishes such as Gulab jamun
      are all popular.

      Indian cuisine has also been exported to many countries throughout the world.
      In countries like the United Kingdom, the US, Australia, and Singapore, Indian
      cuisine has been adapted to local culture.

      Crawfish dishes are very common in many restaurants in Louisiana

      Cajun food is an important part of American cuisine and is another example of
      ‘fusion cuisine.’ French cuisine combined with local ingredients in Louisiana
      has created many of the scrumptious dishes in Cajun cooking.

      Most Cajun dishes are prepared in pots. Seafood, crawfish, shrimps, vegetables,
      and steamed rice are the most common ingredients. Celery, bell peppers, citrus
      fruits, and okra are some of the fruits and vegetables common in Cajun food.

      Cajun cuisine is closely related to Creole cuisine. Gumbo is probably the signature
      dish of both cuisines.

      Taco is a traditional Mexican dish made of tortilla folded around a variety
      of fillings

      Another of the most popular types of cuisines in the world is Mexican food.
      Tacos, enchiladas, tortillas, nachos, and quesadillas are now common dishes
      in many countries around the world. Mexican food is also a popular street food
      as it’s easy to wrap delicious spicy meat, salsas, and vegetables in tortas
      or tortillas.

      Visiting an authentic Mexican restaurant provides an amazing choice of delicious
      dishes. Ethnic Mexican food can include grilled goat, meat with eggs, exotic
      fruits, and hot spicy dishes. Authentic Mexican avocado guacamole is absolutely
      delicious.

      Traditional Mexican cuisine is much different from the ‘Tex-Mex’ type of Mexican
      food that is popular in many countries.

      Jerk is a traditional cooking style in the Caribbean cuisine. In the photo:
      jerk wings with rice and broccoli

      Traditional Caribbean dishes are a combination of African, European, Cajun,
      and Middle Eastern cuisines. Fusing cooking styles from these countries along
      with local ingredients has created a unique food culture.

      Rice is the staple ingredient in most Caribbean dishes. Local ingredients such
      as coconuts, plantains, beans, tomatoes, and chickpeas are used to create tasty
      meals. The addition of fiery chilies such as Scotch bonnet peppers gives many
      Caribbean dishes a powerful kick.

      The most famous food in the Caribbean cuisine is oven-baked Jerk Chicken. This
      is a spicy dish combining chicken, habanero peppers, ginger, garlic, herbs,
      and spices.

      Although Caribbean cuisine defines many dishes from the islands, each island
      has its own food culture.

      Bratwurst is a type of German sausage most commonly made of pork

      German cuisine is famous for its sausages called Wurst in German. There are
      an estimated over 1,500 different types of German sausage. However, German food
      isn’t all about bratwurst. There are many flavorful dishes in German cuisine.

      German specialties include German fries, sauerkraut, rye bread, Spätzle (a type
      of noodle), and dumplings. Popular German desserts include donuts (without a
      hole), Black Forest cake, and Rote Grütze (a delicious berry fruit pudding).

      Of course, Germany is also well-known for its beer such as pilsner and wheat
      beer.

      Borscht is a soup common in Eastern Europe countries. Made with beetroots, it
      has a typical red color

      Russia has a wide and varied food culture due to many culinary influences from
      its different regions. Due to the harsh climate, soups and stews play an important
      role in Russian cuisine. Thick spicy meat broths, noodle soups, and cabbage
      soups are very popular. A popular type of Russian soup is borscht that contains
      beets, cabbage, beef, and eaten with sour cream.

      Grains are another important part of Russian food. For example, buckwheat, barley
      and millet are all used as accompaniments to main meals. Beef Stroganoff, meatballs,
      and a type of Shish kebab are popular meat dishes.

      Even though it has become more expensive, caviar still enjoyed by many people
      in Russia.

      Goulash is enjoyed not only in Hungary but around the world

      Similar to Russian food, Hungarian cuisine is a mixture of soups and stews.
      Maybe the most famous Hungarian dish is goulash made with meat and spicy paprika.
      This classic Hungarian meal can be served as a soup or a stew.

      Similar to many countries in Europe, Hungarian cuisine has been influenced by
      surrounding countries. Therefore, crepes, sweet dumplings, stuffed cabbage rolls,
      and sausages are all found on traditional Hungarian menus.

      Hot dog is a popular street food across USA

      American cuisine has absorbed the cultures of many who came to the United States
      in the 1800s. A fusion of cooking styles, cuisines, and ethnic foods combined
      to create a new type of cuisine. Many chefs took traditional dishes from their
      home countries and put their own twist on them.

      For example, pizza is traditional Italian food. But ‘Chicago’ pizza has a thicker
      and taller crust, whereas ‘New York Slice’ is thinner. A ‘New York Strip Steak’
      is known in other countries as sirloin or contre-filet steak.

      Hamburgers, hot dogs, ‘French fries,’ fried chicken, and deep-pan pizzas are
      new takes on traditional foods from other countries. However, they are all part
      of the list of foods belonging to American cuisine.

    - 'Zoe Li, CNN • Updated 4th May 2018

      (CNN) — We love to write about food. We love to celebrate the good stuff and
      lambaste the bad.

      This is our take on some of the best food cultures and destinations, but of
      course it s subjective. It s time to find out once and for all, which cuisine
      is king as you plan where you ll travel next.

      America knows how to dish food that hits the spot.

      This may be because most of the popular foods in the USA originate in some other
      country. The pizza slice is Italian. Fries are Belgium or Dutch. Hamburgers
      and frankfurters? Likely German. But in the kitchens of the United States, they
      have been improved and added to, to become global icons for food lovers everywhere.

      Don t neglect the homegrown American dishes either.

      There s the traditional stuff such as clam chowder, key lime pie and Cobb salad,
      and most importantly the locavore movement of modern American food started by
      Alice Waters. This promotion of eco-awareness in food culture is carried on
      today by Michelle Obama.

      Cheeseburger -- a perfect example of making good things greater.

      Chocolate chip cookie -- the world would be a little less habitable without
      this Americana classic.

      If you were only allowed to eat the food of one country the rest of your life,
      it would be smart to make it Mexico. The cuisine of the Mesoamerican country
      has a little bit of everything -- you ll never get bored.

      Amongst the enchiladas and the tacos and the helados and the quesadillas you
      ll find the zestiness of Greek salads and the richness of an Indian curry; the
      heat of Thai food and the use-your-hands snackiness of tapas. It is also central
      station for nutritional superfoods. All that avocado, tomato, lime and garlic
      with beans and chocolates and chilies to boot, is rich with antioxidants and
      good healthful things. It doesn t taste healthy though. It tastes like a fiesta
      in your mouth.

      World s 50 best foods

      Mole -- ancient sauce made of chili peppers, spices, chocolate and magic incantations.

      Tacos al pastor -- the spit-roast pork taco, a blend of the pre- and post-Colombian.

      Tamales -- an ancient Mayan food of masa cooked in a leaf wrapping.

      Tostadas -- basically the same as a taco or burrito but served in a crispy fried
      tortilla which breaks into pieces as soon as you bite into it. Impossible to
      eat.

      Street eats are a Thai attraction. Flip through a Thai cook book and you ll
      be hard pressed to find an ingredient list that doesn t run a page long. The
      combination of so many herbs and spices in each dish produces complex flavors
      that somehow come together like orchestral music. Thais fit spicy, sour, salty,
      sweet, chewy, crunchy and slippery into one dish.

      With influences from China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar and a royal culinary
      tradition, Thai cuisine is the best of many worlds. The best part about eating
      Thai food in Thailand though is the hospitality. Sun, beach, service with a
      smile and a plastic bag full of som tam -- that s the good life.

      Tom yam kung -- a rave party for the mouth. The floral notes of lemongrass,
      the earthy galangal, freshness of kaffir lime leaves and the heat of the chilies.

      Massaman curry -- a Thai curry with Islamic roots. Topped our list of the world
      s 50 most delicious foods.

      Som tam -- the popular green papaya salad is sour, extra spicy, sweet and salty.
      It s the best of Thai tastes.

      Pla som -- a fermented fish eaten uncooked is popular in Lawa, Thailand and
      reported to be responsible for bile duct cancer.

      Traveling and eating in Greece feels like a glossy magazine spread come to life,
      but without the Photoshopping. Like the blue seas and white buildings, the kalamata
      olives, feta cheese, the colorful salads and roast meats are all postcard perfect
      by default.

      The secret? Lashings of glistening olive oil. Gift of the gods, olive oil is
      arguably Greece s greatest export, influencing the way people around the world
      think about food and nutritional health. Eating in Greece is also a way of consuming
      history. A bite of dolma or a slurp of lentil soup gives a small taste of life
      in ancient Greece, when they were invented.

      Olive oil -- drizzled on other food, or soaked up by bread, is almost as varied
      as wine in its flavors.

      Spanakopita -- makes spinach palatable with its feta cheese mixture and flaky
      pastry cover.

      Gyros -- late-night drunk eating wouldn t be the same without the pita bread
      sandwich of roast meat and tzatziki.

      Lachanorizo -- basically cabbage and onion cooked to death then mixed with rice.
      Filling, but one-dimensional.

      Sweet and spicy chai tea.

      When a cuisine uses spices in such abundance that the meat and vegetables seem
      like an afterthought, you know you re dealing with cooks dedicated to flavor.
      There are no rules for spice usage as long as it results in something delicious.
      The same spice can add zest to savory and sweet dishes, or can sometimes be
      eaten on its own -- fennel seed is enjoyed as a breath-freshening digestive
      aid at the end of meals.

      And any country that manages to make vegetarian food taste consistently great
      certainly deserves some kind of Nobel prize. The regional varieties are vast.
      There s Goa s seafood, there s the wazwan of Kashmir and there s the coconutty
      richness of Kerala.

      Dal -- India has managed to make boiled lentils exciting.

      Dosa -- a pancake filled with anything from cheese to spicy vegetables, perfect
      for lunch or dinner.

      Chai -- not everyone likes coffee and not everyone likes plain tea, but it s
      hard to resist chai.

      Balti chicken -- an invention for the British palate, should probably have died
      out with colonialism.

      We meet up with Yumi Chiba to find out how she became one of the most renowned
      female sushi chefs in Japan.

      Japanese apply the same precision to their food as they do to their engineering.
      This is the place that spawned tyrannical sushi masters and ramen bullies who
      make their staff and customers tremble with a glare.

      You can get a lavish multicourse kaiseki meal that presents the seasons in a
      spread of visual and culinary poetry. Or grab a seat at a revolving sushi conveyor
      for a solo feast. Or pick up something random and previously unknown in your
      gastronomic lexicon from the refrigerated shelves of a convenience store. It
      s impossible to eat badly in Japan.

      25 Japanese foods we love -- from tempura to miso

      Miso soup -- showcases some of the fundamental flavors of Japanese food, simple
      and wholesome.

      Sushi and sashimi -- who knew that raw fish on rice could become so popular?

      Tempura -- the perfection of deep-frying. Never greasy, the batter is thin and
      light like a crisp tissue.

      Fugu -- is anything really that delicious that it s worth risking your life
      to eat? The poisonous blowfish recently killed diners in Egypt, but is becoming
      more available in Japan.

      Churros: dough meets chocolate.

      Let s eat and drink, then sleep, then work for two hours, then eat and drink.
      Viva Espana, that country whose hedonistic food culture we all secretly wish
      was our own. All that bar-hopping and tapas-eating, the minimal working, the
      9 p.m. dinners, the endless porron challenges -- this is a culture based on,
      around and sometimes even inside food.

      The Spaniards gourmandize the way they flamenco dance, with unbridled passion.
      They munch on snacks throughout the day with intervals of big meals. From the
      fruits of the Mediterranean Sea to the spoils of the Pyrenees, from the saffron
      and cumin notes of the Moors to the insane molecular experiments of Ferran Adria,
      Spanish food is timeless yet avant garde.

      Jamon Iberico -- a whole cured ham hock usually carved by clamping it down in
      a wooden stand like some medieval ritual.

      Churros -- the world s best version of sweet fried dough.

      Gazpacho -- it s refreshing and all, but it s basically liquid salad.

      Freshly baked French baguettes -- mouthwatering.

      If you re one of those people who doesn t like to eat because  there s more
      to life than food  -- visit Paris. It s a city notorious for its curmudgeonly
      denizens, but they all believe in the importance of good food. Two-hour lunch
      breaks for three-course meals are de rigeur.

      Entire two-week vacations are centered on exploring combinations of wines and
      cheeses around the country. Down-to-earth cooking will surprise those who thought
      of the French as the world s food snobs (it is the birthplace of the Michelin
      Guide after all). Cassoulet, pot au feu, steak frites are revelatory when had
      in the right bistro.

      Escargot -- credit the French for turning slimey, garden-dwelling pests into
      a delicacy. Massive respect for making them taste amazing too.

      Macarons -- like unicorn food. In fact anything from a patisserie in France
      seems to have been conjured out of sugar, fairy dust and the dinner wishes of
      little girls.

      Baguette -- the first and last thing that you ll want to eat in France. The
      first bite is transformational; the last will be full of longing.

      Foie gras -- it tastes like 10,000 ducks roasted in butter then reduced to a
      velvet pudding, but some animal advocates decry the cruelty of force-feeding
      fowl to fatten their livers.

      Peking duck -- just one of many Chinese culinary delights.

      GREG BAKER/AFP/AFP/Getty Images

      The people who greet each other with  Have you eaten yet?  are arguably the
      most food-obsessed in the world. Food has been a form of escapism for the Chinese
      throughout its tumultuous history.

      The Chinese entrepreneurial spirit and appreciation for the finer points of
      frugality -- the folks are cheap, crafty and food-crazed -- results in one of
      the bravest tribes of eaters in the world. But the Chinese don t just cook and
      sell anything, they also make it taste great.

      China is the place to go to get food shock a dozen times a day.  You can eat
      that?  will become the intrepid food traveler s daily refrain. China s regional
      cuisines are so varied it s hard to believe they re from the same nation. It
      s not a food culture you can easily summarize, except to say you ll invariably
      want seconds.

      Sweet and sour pork -- a guilty pleasure that has taken on different forms.

      Dim sum -- a grand tradition from Hong Kong to New York.

      Roast suckling pig and Peking duck -- wonders of different styles of ovens adopted
      by Chinese chefs.

      Xiaolongbao -- incredible soup-filled surprises. How do they get that dumpling
      skin to hold all that hot broth?

      Shark s fin soup -- rallying for Chinese restaurants to ban the dish has been
      a pet issue of green campaigners in recent years.

      Nothing beats traditional Neapolitan pizza

      MARIO LAPORTA/AFP/AFP/Getty Images

      Italian food has enslaved tastebuds around the globe for centuries, with its
      zesty tomato sauces, those clever things they do with wheat flour and desserts
      that are basically vehicles for cream. It s all so simple. Get some noodles,
      get some olive oil, get some garlic, maybe a tomato or a slice of bacon. Bam,
      you have a party on a plate. And it is all so easy to cook and eat.

      From the cheesy risottos to the crisp fried meats, Italian cuisine is a compendium
      of crowd-pleasing comfort food. Many people have welcomed it into their homes,
      especially novice cooks. Therein lies the real genius -- Italian food has become
      everyman s food.

      Italy s 20 regions, dish by delicious dish

      Ragu alla bolognese (spaghetti bolognaise) -- the world s go-to  can t decide
      what to have  food.

      Pizza -- mind-bogglingly simple yet satisfying dish. Staple diet of bachelors
      and college students.

      Italian-style salami -- second only to cigarettes as a source of addiction.

      Coffee -- cappuccino is for breakfast? Forget it. We want it all day and all
      night.

      Buffalo mozzarella -- those balls of spongy, off-white, subtly flavored cheeses
      of water buffalo milk. The flavor s so subtle you have to imagine it.'

    - 'Types of Cuisine From Around the World With Their Popular Foods

      Most countries and regions in the world have their own particular cuisine. Different
      types of cuisines involve certain cooking practices, local ingredients, and
      a combination of spices. Some food cultures are a fusion of foods from different
      countries. From these, delicious foods have developed that provide unique culinary
      experiences.

      There are hundreds of different cuisines in the world. Famous cuisines in the
      world include French, Thai, Italian, Indian, and Chinese. In large cities, it
      is also not uncommon to find restaurants serving dishes from Moroccan, Lebanese,
      Vietnamese, and Hungarian cuisines.

      Even in countries that have their own particular kind of cuisine, it is not
      uncommon to have regional variations. For example, some types of food may be
      prepared in different ways or include a different variety of ingredients.

      In this article, you will learn about some of the top cuisines in the world.
      You will also find out where some famous dishes originated from.

      The French Provencal cuisine uses a lot of herbs

      Many regard French cuisine as one of the best cuisines in the world. French
      food involves ingredients such as butter, cream, wine, herbs, chocolate, and
      vegetables. French pastry dishes, cheese, bread, and wine are famous throughout
      the world.

      Food culture in France also revolves around locally sourced ingredients. On
      the Mediterranean coast, seafood is very popular. Provencal cuisine uses tarragon
      and a host of other herbs and spices. Paris itself has over 9,000 restaurants
      serving French classics and dishes from around the world.

      Dumplings and dim sum are a common food in the Chinese cuisine

      Chinese cuisine is one of the most diverse food cultures in the world. Traditionally,
      Chinese food is served with noodles or rice. Also, Chinese dumplings form a
      large part of the staple diet in many regions of China. There are several main
      cuisines in Chinese cookery – Cantonese, Sichuan, Fujian, and Hunan cuisines
      are the most well-known.

      Most Chinese dishes contain a mixture of vegetables that are stir-fried and
      combined with aromatic spices and herbs. For example, ginger is often fried
      along with garlic and onions to create flavorsome dishes. Also, soy sauce, rice
      vinegar, and fish sauce are commonly used to create a blend of wonderful flavors.

      Chinese cuisine could be regarded as the one of the most important in the world.
      Chinese cooking styles have influenced other foods from Korea, the Philippines,
      Thailand, and Vietnam. Chinese dishes are so popular that most cities in the
      world have a number of Chinese restaurants. Sweet and sour chicken and chop
      suey are the most popular Chinese dishes outside of China.

      Sushi is a very popular food in Japanese restaurants

      Japanese dishes have become one of the most important food genres in the world.
      Boiled rice usually accompanies most dishes with grilled fish, pickled vegetables,
      or deep-fried vegetables. Tofu also plays an important part in traditional Japanese
      cuisine.

      Of course, sushi is one of the most well-known type of Japanese food. Great
      care and precision goes into creating delicious rice rolls with raw fish, vegetables,
      and nori. These are accompanied with pickled ginger and dipping sauces. Japanese
      food culture is so influential that many countries around the world developed
      their own type of sushi varieties.

      Going into a Japanese restaurant, you often see the chef working in an open
      kitchen at a Teppanyaki grill.

      After your delicious Japanese meal, you can finish off with a cup of refreshing
      type of tea such as: green tea, oolong tea, or jasmine tea.

      Pasta dishes are one of the most famous foods in Italian cuisine

      Many people regard Italy as the country with the best food in the world. Pasta
      dishes in Italian cuisine are one of the most popular and favorite types of
      food in the world. There are very few people in the world who haven’t tried
      delicious Italian foods like pizza, spaghetti, or delicious Italian ice cream.
      Many classic Italian dishes also include the regional name in their title. For
      example, spaghetti Bolognese from Bologna and Parma ham or Parmesan cheese from
      Parma.

      The mainstays of the popular Italian cuisine are pasta, rice, tomatoes, and
      cheese. Many regional variations include types of meat, seafood, or sausages
      along with delicious sauces. These can be flavored with herbs such as oregano,
      basil, or a combination of other fresh herbs.

      There is also great variation in food cultures between the various regions of
      Italy. Abruzzo cuisine from the mountainous and coastal regions has pasta, seafood,
      lamb, and wild mushrooms. Neapolitan cuisine is famous for foods like pizzas,
      spaghetti, and mozzarella. Famous Italian dishes such as lasagna, tortellini,
      and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese are from areas around Bologna and Modena.

      Greek salad is a favorite food for Greek cuisine lovers

      Greek food culture is one of the oldest in the world. Cuisine from Greece and
      the Greek islands is heavily influenced by olive oil, vegetables, fish, and
      various types of meat. In fact, a simple Greek salad may just be fresh cucumbers,
      tomatoes, red onions, a dash of olive oil, a few tasty olives, and a thick slice
      of feta cheese.

      Some popular Greek dishes include moussaka made from eggplant, tzatziki (a type
      of yogurt dip), or gyro – a type of kebab with lamb, pork, or chicken meat.
      Due to its long coastline, seafood such as squid, mussels, fish, and lobster
      are popular food choices.

      After feasting on Greek delicacies, you may have room for some common Greek
      desserts. A delicious filo pastry with layers of nuts and honey called baklava
      is one of the most favorite Greek sweet foods.

      Seafood paella is a popular dish served in many Spanish restaurants

      Similar to many countries around the Mediterranean Sea, Spanish cuisine is heavily
      influenced by seafood. A combination of mussels, cuttlefish, shrimps, and lobster
      together with paprika, saffron and rich broth create the classic seafood paella.

      Spanish food culture isn’t limited just to seafood. This popular cuisine also
      includes foods like cured meats such as Serrano or Iberico ham. Chorizo sausage,
      mushrooms, and cooked meat are used in Spanish appetizers – tapas.

      Different regions of Spain also have culinary variations. For example, La Rioja
      is famous for its red wine, cured pork, and lamb dishes. Seafood, thyme soup,
      and bean omelets are popular in Catalan cuisine. Andalusia is famous for hot
      soups, fish stews, and cold soups such as gazpacho.

      Olive oil is a staple ingredient in the Mediterranean cuisine

      It can be difficult to define what exactly Mediterranean cuisine is as there
      is great variety of dishes in it. The key ingredients of Mediterranean cuisine
      are basic foods such as olive oil, fresh vegetables, wheat (such as bread and
      pasta), and grape (such as wine).

      Mediterranean food styles include culinary delicacies from countries such as
      Morocco, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Turkey, and the Middle East.

      Mediterranean food culture is also the basis of the Mediterranean diet. This
      kind of diet contains olive oil, fresh vegetables and fruits, seafood, and nuts.

      Hummus dip with pita bread is a common type of food served in many Lebanese
      restaurants

      Lebanese food culture comprises cuisines from other Mediterranean countries.
      Poultry, seafood, lamb, or goat meat are prepared with olive oil, garlic, and
      other spices. These are usually consumed with pitta bread and fresh or grilled
      vegetables.

      Chickpeas also form a staple part of Lebanese cuisine. These are cooked and
      blended with olive oil, tahini, and lemon juice to create a delicious nutty
      hummus dip.

      As well as classic Mediterranean desserts such as baklava or halva, fresh or
      dried types of dates are also widely used in Lebanese sweet dishes.

      A vegetable couscous is served in Moroccan tagine

      Moroccan dishes are a great example of when different cuisines fuse to form
      a new type of food genre. Moroccan cuisine uses a goat, lamb, poultry, beef,
      and seafood as its basis. These meats are spiced and cooked along with lemons,
      dried fruits, and olive oil.

      One of the most famous foods in the popular Moroccan cuisine is couscous. This
      common wheat-based food is combined with various spices, herbs, and vegetables
      to create a versatile and delicious side dish. Another favorite Moroccan classic
      dish is a tagine. This is an earthenware dish used to cook meat along with vegetables
      or dried fruits.

      As with many dishes in North Africa, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean,
      Moroccan cuisine uses flatbread as a meal accompaniment.

      Lamb kebab is a popular type of dish in the Turkish cuisine

      Turkish food is another example of a fusion of various food cultures from Asia,
      Europe, and the Middle East. Eggplant, stuffed dolmas, lamb kebabs, and delicious
      vegetable stews are just some of the culinary delights you can experience with
      Turkish food. Nuts such as hazelnuts, walnuts, and chestnuts are common food
      ingredients in savory and sweet dishes.

      One important part of Turkish cuisine is yogurt. In fact, the name ‘yogurt’
      is a Turkish word. Yogurt and types of spiced yogurt are an accompaniment to
      many vegetable and meat dishes in Turkey. Cheese made from sheep’s milk is another
      important dairy product in Turkish cuisine.

      Popular beverages in Turkey include strong Turkish coffee, hot black tea, and
      Ayran – a type of yogurt drink.

      Pad Thai is a famous and delicious dish to try when visiting Thailand

      Thai cuisine is all about strong spicy flavors that incorporate sweet, sour,
      and hot elements. Some of the world’s most popular dishes are from Thailand.
      Pad Thai, green curry, and tom yum goong are just some examples of the best
      dishes from Thailand.

      Thai food is traditionally served with rice or noodles. Even spicy Thai soups
      or broths usually contain basic rice noodles.

      One of the unique features of Thai cuisine is its wide use of spices, herbs,
      and sauces. For example, fresh basil, lemongrass, kaffir lime, chilies, and
      coconut milk are some of the ingredients in Thai green curry. Also, cloves,
      ginger, cilantro, mint, and turmeric are common ingredients.

      Trying many of the different dishes in Thailand is usually a culinary experience
      that few people forget.

      Samosas may take different fillings and forms, depending on the region in India

      When it comes to spicy, aromatic dishes, Indian cuisine usually tops the list.
      The amazing range of spices, chilies, and herbs combine to make some of the
      spiciest foods you can eat.

      In India, the range of different cuisines is also impressive. Each region in
      India has its own ethnic foods and dishes. These can include vegetable pastry
      morsels such as samosas, vegetarian curries, beans with fermented fish, and
      vegetable pakoras.

      Street food is also part of the food culture in India. Tandoori chicken served
      with basic naan bread, spicy Indian snacks, and sweet dishes such as Gulab jamun
      are all popular.

      Indian cuisine has also been exported to many countries throughout the world.
      In countries like the United Kingdom, the US, Australia, and Singapore, Indian
      cuisine has been adapted to local culture.

      Crawfish dishes are very common in many restaurants in Louisiana

      Cajun food is an important part of American cuisine and is another example of
      ‘fusion cuisine.’ French cuisine combined with local ingredients in Louisiana
      has created many of the scrumptious dishes in Cajun cooking.

      Most Cajun dishes are prepared in pots. Seafood, crawfish, shrimps, vegetables,
      and steamed rice are the most common ingredients. Celery, bell peppers, citrus
      fruits, and okra are some of the fruits and vegetables common in Cajun food.

      Cajun cuisine is closely related to Creole cuisine. Gumbo is probably the signature
      dish of both cuisines.

      Taco is a traditional Mexican dish made of tortilla folded around a variety
      of fillings

      Another of the most popular types of cuisines in the world is Mexican food.
      Tacos, enchiladas, tortillas, nachos, and quesadillas are now common dishes
      in many countries around the world. Mexican food is also a popular street food
      as it’s easy to wrap delicious spicy meat, salsas, and vegetables in tortas
      or tortillas.

      Visiting an authentic Mexican restaurant provides an amazing choice of delicious
      dishes. Ethnic Mexican food can include grilled goat, meat with eggs, exotic
      fruits, and hot spicy dishes. Authentic Mexican avocado guacamole is absolutely
      delicious.

      Traditional Mexican cuisine is much different from the ‘Tex-Mex’ type of Mexican
      food that is popular in many countries.

      Jerk is a traditional cooking style in the Caribbean cuisine. In the photo:
      jerk wings with rice and broccoli

      Traditional Caribbean dishes are a combination of African, European, Cajun,
      and Middle Eastern cuisines. Fusing cooking styles from these countries along
      with local ingredients has created a unique food culture.

      Rice is the staple ingredient in most Caribbean dishes. Local ingredients such
      as coconuts, plantains, beans, tomatoes, and chickpeas are used to create tasty
      meals. The addition of fiery chilies such as Scotch bonnet peppers gives many
      Caribbean dishes a powerful kick.

      The most famous food in the Caribbean cuisine is oven-baked Jerk Chicken. This
      is a spicy dish combining chicken, habanero peppers, ginger, garlic, herbs,
      and spices.

      Although Caribbean cuisine defines many dishes from the islands, each island
      has its own food culture.

      Bratwurst is a type of German sausage most commonly made of pork

      German cuisine is famous for its sausages called Wurst in German. There are
      an estimated over 1,500 different types of German sausage. However, German food
      isn’t all about bratwurst. There are many flavorful dishes in German cuisine.

      German specialties include German fries, sauerkraut, rye bread, Spätzle (a type
      of noodle), and dumplings. Popular German desserts include donuts (without a
      hole), Black Forest cake, and Rote Grütze (a delicious berry fruit pudding).

      Of course, Germany is also well-known for its beer such as pilsner and wheat
      beer.

      Borscht is a soup common in Eastern Europe countries. Made with beetroots, it
      has a typical red color

      Russia has a wide and varied food culture due to many culinary influences from
      its different regions. Due to the harsh climate, soups and stews play an important
      role in Russian cuisine. Thick spicy meat broths, noodle soups, and cabbage
      soups are very popular. A popular type of Russian soup is borscht that contains
      beets, cabbage, beef, and eaten with sour cream.

      Grains are another important part of Russian food. For example, buckwheat, barley
      and millet are all used as accompaniments to main meals. Beef Stroganoff, meatballs,
      and a type of Shish kebab are popular meat dishes.

      Even though it has become more expensive, caviar still enjoyed by many people
      in Russia.

      Goulash is enjoyed not only in Hungary but around the world

      Similar to Russian food, Hungarian cuisine is a mixture of soups and stews.
      Maybe the most famous Hungarian dish is goulash made with meat and spicy paprika.
      This classic Hungarian meal can be served as a soup or a stew.

      Similar to many countries in Europe, Hungarian cuisine has been influenced by
      surrounding countries. Therefore, crepes, sweet dumplings, stuffed cabbage rolls,
      and sausages are all found on traditional Hungarian menus.

      Hot dog is a popular street food across USA

      American cuisine has absorbed the cultures of many who came to the United States
      in the 1800s. A fusion of cooking styles, cuisines, and ethnic foods combined
      to create a new type of cuisine. Many chefs took traditional dishes from their
      home countries and put their own twist on them.

      For example, pizza is traditional Italian food. But ‘Chicago’ pizza has a thicker
      and taller crust, whereas ‘New York Slice’ is thinner. A ‘New York Strip Steak’
      is known in other countries as sirloin or contre-filet steak.

      Hamburgers, hot dogs, ‘French fries,’ fried chicken, and deep-pan pizzas are
      new takes on traditional foods from other countries. However, they are all part
      of the list of foods belonging to American cuisine.

    - 'Stop calling yourself a ‘foodie’

      By Roberto A. Ferdman

      (Amy King/The Washington Post; iStock)

      In late 1984, The New York Times published a piece that was, at least indirectly,
      about a word we could all do without. The story covered the release of  The
      Official Foodie Handbook  by journalists Ann Barr and Paul Levy, which chronicled,
      among other things, the lives of food lovers around the world. They were food
      adventure seekers, culinary addicts who were interested in all food experiences,
      refined and not.

      A foodie,  the authors wrote,  is a person who is very, very, very interested
      in food.

      The two weren t the first to utter the term — that appears to have been Gael
      Greene, who used it in a 1980 column for New York Magazine, according to etymologist
      Barry Popik. Nor, as it happened, were they the last. But for years, the word
      was used sparingly. A populist food critic might have been described as a  foodie.  A
      gustatory pleasure seeker with the time and money to invest in obscure cooking
      methods, niche coffee roasting techniques, and not-to-be-missed meals might
      have earned the distinction too. It wasn t a compliment, it was just a descriptor.
      It was an unpretentious way to categorize a growing but still relatively small
      group of people.

      And then it wasn t.

      A look at Google Ngram, which tracks the frequency of words in digitized books,
      shows the word was nonexistent until it appeared in the early 1980s, but its
      use grew quickly shortly after the publication of Barr and Levy s book.

      A peek at Google Trends, which tracks the relative frequency with which people
      search for various things, tells a similar story. Interest in the word  foodie,  which
      seems to have piqued popular interest in late 2006, is trending at its highest
      ever. People are typing it in and pressing go.

      Of course, you don t need Google s data to know the word is everywhere. You
      have heard it, I am sure, if not today then yesterday, and if not yesterday
      then the day before. It is inescapable.

      Everyone is a  foodie

      Over time, the word has undergone an all-too-familiar transformation, bubbling
      up to a point of ubiquity that has stripped the word of any semblance of meaning.
      On a good day — or bad, depending on how you look at it — most people would
      qualify as a  foodie  to someone. The net the word casts is just too wide.

      When asked about the word in 2012, Philipino restaurateur Elbert Cuenca had
      this to say:

      It has come to the point of being bastardized. The word ‘foodie,’ which is nothing
      more than a modern-day casual substitute for ‘gourmet,’ has been relegated to
      mean anyone who likes food and/or eats out a lot. But who doesn’t like food?
      Who doesn’t eat out a lot?

      The answer, on the off chance there is any doubt, is not that many people.

      It s no wonder that the word is bemoaned by so many people who work within the
      world the term glorifies. Chefs hate it, because it empowers their customers
      to feign knowledge about things they don t actually understand. Mark Bittman
      doesn t care for it, because it too often reveres rather than challenges the
      current and flawed food system. Nor does British journalist and gourmand John
      Lanchester, who chronicled his frustration with mass  foodie -ism in a 2014
      New Yorker piece.

      This is how he explained it:

      Everyone’s a critic, they say, and that’s certainly true of the food world today.
      Of course, everyone has always been a critic, in the sense that customers have
      always made the most basic judgment of all: Do I want to come back to this joint?
      But there’s a contemporary development with respect to volume, in the dual sense
      of quantity and loudness. The volume of all this critical chatter is turned
      way up, and it’s harder than ever to ignore. Food is my favorite thing to talk
      about and to learn about, but an interest that is reasonable on a personal and
      an individual scale has grown out of all proportion in the wider culture.

      Among the list of major publications that have published something that argues,
      in so many words, that the term  foodie  is awful: The Huffington Post, The
      Daily Beast, The New York Times, and Saveur.

      The Observer, meanwhile, took its contempt a step further, coining a new term
      in 2009 to mock those who embrace its predecessor: Foodiots.

      We see it in the meticulous record-keeping of eating habits on personal blogs.
      The ubiquitous Facebook updates and tweets about subscribers’ most recent meals.
      (Surely you also have those five or so friends whose feeds are 90 percent food-consumption-related?)
      The requisite iPhone pic before a certain kind of diner—let’s call him a foodiot—ravages
      his plate.

      But it still appears everywhere

      There is no shortage of public  foodie  resentment. From people in the know,
      people whose opinions so-called  foodies  should, theoretically, value highly,
      no less. And yet, despite the heaping piles of expertly deglazed vitriol, the
      word persists.

      There are obvious (ab)users, who use the word readily and unironically, the
      sort who post really close pictures of everything they eat or watch hours of
      food television each day without ever learning how to work an oven.

      But there are others, too, who have usurped the word in arguably more upsetting
      ways.

      Just this past Monday, the National Restaurant Association published its latest
      industry forecast. In it, you ll find this doozy:  Here’s a profile of the American
      Foodie 2.0.

      Foodie  has become a marketing weapon, a buzzword which companies regurgitate
      in whatever form suits the pitch. There are dating sites for  foodies , blogs
      about Paleo  foodie -ism (an oxymoron, if I ve ever heard one), even business-help
      pieces about how companies can  better target foodies.

      I can t think of anywhere the word  foodie  appears more often in my life than
      in my email inbox, where PR pitches seem to invoke it at every opportunity.
      A recent search turned up dozens of results — hundreds more when I extended
      the search to my spam folder. One of the more recent examples (which went unanswered)
      was about a list of the  Best Cities for Food Trucks in the U.S.   Foodies today
      are considered  hip,   it read, as though it were written by someone s grandparents.

      The irony too many miss

      The problem with the word  foodie,  which many have hopefully gleaned by this
      point, boils down to a simple truth: You can’t possibly call yourself a  foodie  if
      you’re actually a  foodie.  There is a great irony in describing yourself as
      a food insider in a way no actual food insider ever would. The act itself precludes
      you from being part of the world you want to associate yourself with. The word
      doubles as a compliment and an insult, depending on who utters it.

      In this sense, using the word  foodie  is like wearing an outfit that was fashionable
      years before, long enough ago that it s no longer in style but not long enough
      ago for some to mistake it as still being cool. The analogy, of course, doesn
      t end there, because those same people wearing what was all the rage five years
      ago are also announcing that they should be thought of as members of the fashion-obsessed
      squad.

      There s nothing wrong with food populism. It s this very trend, after all, that
      has helped buoy the food movement, which is slowly reversing how disconnected
      we have all become from the production of our food. But some things have clearly
      been lost in the collective trek toward announcing whenever possible how much
      we like to eat.

      Among them, is how Levy, one the term s pioneers, first encountered the term:
      as an insult. This is how he explained it in a 2007 piece published in The Guardian:

      In late 1981 Ann Barr, then features editor of Harper s & Queen, noticed the
      food world was shifting on its tectonic plates, and that perfectly sane people
      had suddenly become obsessed with every aspect of food.

      She invited readers to write in and immediately received several attacks upon
      a greedy, single-minded and highly visible food-obsessive who wrote in the magazine
      at the time - me. Thus it was that, in the issue of August 1982, I was derided
      in the anonymous article (edited, as it happens, by me) as the ghastly, his-stomach-is-bigger-than-his-eyes,
      original, appetite-unsuppressed, lip-smacking  king foodie.  I had to sign a
      legal undertaking not to sue the magazine or myself for libel.

      It s fitting, isn t it, how we have come full circle?

      A foodie is a person who has an ardent or refined interest in food[1] and who
      eats food not only out of hunger but due to their interest or hobby. The terms  gastronome  and  gourmet  define
      the same thing, i.e. a person who enjoys food for pleasure.

      1 Earliest uses of the word

      2 Pursuits

      Earliest uses of the word[edit]

      The  foodie —not as elitist as a gourmet, more discriminating than a glutton—was
      first named in print in the early 1980s. The term came into use almost simultaneously
      in the United States and Britain. Priority goes to Gael Greene, who, in June
      1980, wrote in New York Magazine of a character who  slips into the small Art
      Deco dining room of Restaurant d Olympe ... to graze cheeks with her devotees,
      serious foodies. [2] Immediately afterwards the foodie was defined in the British
      press. Ann Barr, features editor of the London magazine Harper s & Queen, had
      asked readers to comment on a then-new obsession with food. Several readers  responses
      named Paul Levy, food writer on the same magazine, as the perfect example. Levy
      played along,[3] contributing an anonymous article in August 1982, defining
      the term ( Foodies are foodist. They dislike and despise all non-foodies )[4]
      and characterizing himself as the  ghastly, his-stomach-is-bigger-than-his-eyes,
      original, appetite-unsuppressed, lip-smacking  king foodie  .[3] The word gained
      currency rapidly, partly because Barr and Levy followed up with a book, The
      Official Foodie Handbook, published in 1984.[5]

      Pursuits[edit]

      Foodies are a distinct hobbyist group. Typical foodie interests and activities
      include the food industry, wineries and wine tasting, breweries and beer sampling,
      food science, following restaurant openings and closings and occasionally reopenings,
      food distribution, food fads, health and nutrition, cooking classes, culinary
      tourism, and restaurant management. A foodie might develop a particular interest
      in a specific item, such as the best egg cream or burrito. Many publications
      have food columns that cater to foodies and many of the websites carrying the
      name foodie have become popular amongst the foodies.[6] Interest by foodies
      in the 1980s and 1990s gave rise to the Food Network and other specialized food
      programming, popular films and television shows about food such as Top Chef
      and Iron Chef, a renaissance in specialized cookbooks, specialized periodicals
      such as Gourmet Magazine and Cook s Illustrated, growing popularity of farmers  markets,[7]
      food-oriented websites like Zagat s and Yelp, publishing and reading food blogs
      like Foodbeast and foodieworld, specialized kitchenware stores like Williams-Sonoma
      and Sur La Table, and the institution of the celebrity chef.

      Foodies have a significant social media presence; food lovers have created their
      own YouTube channels where they show what they cook and where they eat around
      the world.[8] It has also become a common practice to take photos of food and
      beverages consumed at home or outside and share them on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
      or other media in a form of food porn.[9]

      Chris Onstad, author of the webcomic Achewood and the author of The Achewood
      Cookbook, stated a dislike for the term. Onstad said  There are so many words
      that already describe the concept of people who like food, or enjoy cooking,
      or enjoy knowing about cooking.  Foodie : It s like the infantile diminutive—you
      put a  y  on the end of everything to make it childlike. We don t need it. It
      s embarrassing.  Girl, I m a foodie.  Like oh my God. [10]

      Many journalists, like Roberto A. Ferdman, author of Stop Calling Yourself a  Foodie  in
      the Washington Post, also criticize the word saying  There is a great irony
      in describing yourself as a food insider in a way no actual food insider ever
      would. [11] Ferdman claims that people who associate themselves with being a  foodie  are
      in fact distancing themselves from the group they wish to be associated with.
      The author then states that there is nothing wrong with having an interest in
      food, in fact this popular trend is helping the food movement thrive. Ferdman
      s main argument is that since the word is so widely used, its meaning has become
      ubiquitous and some meaning is lost upon the need to constantly announce how
      much someone likes to eat.

      The answer, on the off chance there is any doubt, is not that many people.

      It s no wonder that the word is bemoaned by so many people who work within the
      world the term glorifies. Chefs hate it, because it empowers their customers
      to feign knowledge about things they don t actually understand. Mark Bittman
      doesn t care for it, because it too often reveres rather than challenges the
      current and flawed food system. Nor does British journalist and gourmand John
      Lanchester, who chronicled his frustration with mass  foodie -ism in a 2014
      New Yorker piece.

      This is how he explained it:

      Everyone’s a critic, they say, and that’s certainly true of the food world today.
      Of course, everyone has always been a critic, in the sense that customers have
      always made the most basic judgment of all: Do I want to come back to this joint?
      But there’s a contemporary development with respect to volume, in the dual sense
      of quantity and loudness. The volume of all this critical chatter is turned
      way up, and it’s harder than ever to ignore. Food is my favorite thing to talk
      about and to learn about, but an interest that is reasonable on a personal and
      an individual scale has grown out of all proportion in the wider culture.

      Among the list of major publications that have published something that argues,
      in so many words, that the term  foodie  is awful: The Huffington Post, The
      Daily Beast, The New York Times, and Saveur.

      The Observer, meanwhile, took its contempt a step further, coining a new term
      in 2009 to mock those who embrace its predecessor: Foodiots.

      We see it in the meticulous record-keeping of eating habits on personal blogs.
      The ubiquitous Facebook updates and tweets about subscribers’ most recent meals.
      (Surely you also have those five or so friends whose feeds are 90 percent food-consumption-related?)
      The requisite iPhone pic before a certain kind of diner—let’s call him a foodiot—ravages
      his plate.

      But it still appears everywhere

      There is no shortage of public  foodie  resentment. From people in the know,
      people whose opinions so-called  foodies  should, theoretically, value highly,
      no less. And yet, despite the heaping piles of expertly deglazed vitriol, the
      word persists.

      There are obvious (ab)users, who use the word readily and unironically, the
      sort who post really close pictures of everything they eat or watch hours of
      food television each day without ever learning how to work an oven.

      But there are others, too, who have usurped the word in arguably more upsetting
      ways.

      Just this past Monday, the National Restaurant Association published its latest
      industry forecast. In it, you ll find this doozy:  Here’s a profile of the American
      Foodie 2.0.

      Foodie  has become a marketing weapon, a buzzword which companies regurgitate
      in whatever form suits the pitch. There are dating sites for  foodies , blogs
      about Paleo  foodie -ism (an oxymoron, if I ve ever heard one), even business-help
      pieces about how companies can  better target foodies.

      I can t think of anywhere the word  foodie  appears more often in my life than
      in my email inbox, where PR pitches seem to invoke it at every opportunity.
      A recent search turned up dozens of results — hundreds more when I extended
      the search to my spam folder. One of the more recent examples (which went unanswered)
      was about a list of the  Best Cities for Food Trucks in the U.S.   Foodies today
      are considered  hip,   it read, as though it were written by someone s grandparents.

      The irony too many miss

      The problem with the word  foodie,  which many have hopefully gleaned by this
      point, boils down to a simple truth: You can’t possibly call yourself a  foodie  if
      you’re actually a  foodie.  There is a great irony in describing yourself as
      a food insider in a way no actual food insider ever would. The act itself precludes
      you from being part of the world you want to associate yourself with. The word
      doubles as a compliment and an insult, depending on who utters it.

      In this sense, using the word  foodie  is like wearing an outfit that was fashionable
      years before, long enough ago that it s no longer in style but not long enough
      ago for some to mistake it as still being cool. The analogy, of course, doesn
      t end there, because those same people wearing what was all the rage five years
      ago are also announcing that they should be thought of as members of the fashion-obsessed
      squad.

      There s nothing wrong with food populism. It s this very trend, after all, that
      has helped buoy the food movement, which is slowly reversing how disconnected
      we have all become from the production of our food. But some things have clearly
      been lost in the collective trek toward announcing whenever possible how much
      we like to eat.

      Among them, is how Levy, one the term s pioneers, first encountered the term:
      as an insult. This is how he explained it in a 2007 piece published in The Guardian:

      In late 1981 Ann Barr, then features editor of Harper s & Queen, noticed the
      food world was shifting on its tectonic plates, and that perfectly sane people
      had suddenly become obsessed with every aspect of food.

      She invited readers to write in and immediately received several attacks upon
      a greedy, single-minded and highly visible food-obsessive who wrote in the magazine
      at the time - me. Thus it was that, in the issue of August 1982, I was derided
      in the anonymous article (edited, as it happens, by me) as the ghastly, his-stomach-is-bigger-than-his-eyes,
      original, appetite-unsuppressed, lip-smacking  king foodie.  I had to sign a
      legal undertaking not to sue the magazine or myself for libel.

      It s fitting, isn t it, how we have come full circle?
