      All four movies in the Toy Story series are great. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and
      Don Rickles are all truly great actors and the creativity of the Pixar Animation
      Studios team is really top notch.

      It is neat to see how they progressed in the series with the quality.'

      You''re right. The quality of all of Pixar''s movies have increased over the
      years. This is due, in no small part, to the fact that they have long term teams
      that work together on multiple projects. Further, Pixar, as a company, cares
      more about creating high quality movies than they do making the most money possible.
      This is their company''s culture and the reason for their continuing success.

      I once heard someone erased progress on it like a saved file but someone had
      it on their laptop or something.'
