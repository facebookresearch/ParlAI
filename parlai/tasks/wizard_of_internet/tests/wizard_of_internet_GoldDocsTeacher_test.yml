      Q: What is the Morse code used by Babyface in Sid s room?

      Q: Is  Toy Story  based on a book?

      Every Kid s Fantasy

      3 February 2009 | by alexkolokotronis – See all my reviews

      Toy Story is the film that started Pixar Animated Studios into its long string
      of never ending success. What Pixar does is not just absorb the younger demographic
      and keep the older ones mildly entertained. It completely absorbs everyone watching
      no matter the age or the level of maturity, films of Pixar, starting from Toy
      Story, have kept a certain magical touch around it with an unexpected amount
      of depth. Everyone as a child imagines their toys will come alive and go on
      their own adventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does not
      attract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather with its material.
      The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned
      voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting
      for animated films as there is to a live-action one. As a result of this Pixar
      stays faithful to its material and creates a great genuine and warm feeling
      around the film and its characters.'

    - "Pixar Animation Studios: Creative Kaizen\nBy HBSstudent11\nIliad S.A.: the\
      \ story behind France’s telecommunications maverick\nHow Pixar’s innovative\
      \ production process ensures creative quality for audiences\nPixar: A Winner\n\
      Pixar has been highly effective at aligning its business and operating models\
      \ to drive success. Founded 1986, Pixar has produced 16 feature animated films\
      \ which together have grossed almost $4 billion at the box office (1). Critically\
      \ acclaimed projects include: Toy Story, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, Up, and\
      \ Finding Nemo. Disney took notice of Pixar’s ability to churn out blockbusters,\
      \ and acquired them in 2006 (2). This ability seems to be driven by Pixar’s\
      \ unique model of organization, production, and talent retention.\nPixar makes\
      \ money by unifying art and technology to produce original animated films that\
      \ motivate audiences to buy movie tickets, DVDs, digital copies, and merchandise.\
      \ These films are marketed towards children, but have the emotional depth and\
      \ production quality to appeal to adults. Pixar’s key market differentiator\
      \ is its focus on quality. Instead of throwing out a portfolio of movies every\
      \ year and hoping that a few become blockbusters, Pixar makes big bets on a\
      \ fewer number of films, producing one film every four to five years. It minimizes\
      \ risk by ensuring the quality of these films via a highly monitored production\
      \ process.\nPixar has a very unique operating model compared to other film studios.\
      \ In other studios, new creative teams are formed around new film concepts and\
      \ then disbanded once the films are complete. Pixar takes a drastically different\
      \ approach and retains creative talent as long-term employees. This allows teams\
      \ to improve their skills and operating processes over time with increased repetition\
      \ (3). Pixar leaders believe that the initial idea matters a lot less than the\
      \ people who actually iterate and brainstorm around that idea throughout the\
      \ production process (4). Other key elements of Pixar’s successful operating\
      \ model include:\nIncubator Teams: When concepts are still nascent, small teams\
      \ of directors, writers, and artists serve as incubators that work together\
      \ to improve and expand on the initial ideas. This tests the idea, but also\
      \ serves as a way for teams to feel out their strengths and weaknesses and learn\
      \ how they should work together moving forward (4).\nShared Dailies: Every day,\
      \ directors and producers must show their daily work to everyone (instead of\
      \ just a small team like at other studios). All members of the crew are encouraged\
      \ to offer suggestions for improvement. Dailies serve as a great way to share\
      \ information with the entire team and break down departmental barriers (4).\n\
      Creative Brain Trust: This is a committee of creative leaders in the company\
      \ that directors/producers can access to help solve production problems. An\
      \ important and unique dynamic of this group is that, unlike traditional studio\
      \ development executives, the advisors of this committee have no authority.\
      \ Instead, they are peers whose purpose is solely to offer creative input and\
      \ advice (5).\nPostmortems: These are meetings that occur after a film is finished\
      \ and discuss the successes and failures of the process. This is critical for\
      \ the growth of the teams (as they will largely remain together to work on the\
      \ next Pixar film) and helps improve work output and processes for the future\
      \ (4).\nPixar University: The company offers classes across disciplines to foster\
      \ communication between departments and emphasize the idea of “learning and\
      \ growing together” (3).\nPixar Campus: The campus has an open plan that maximizes\
      \ interaction among colleagues during the workday to stimulate conversation\
      \ and free flow of ideas (3).\nBusiness and Operating Model Alignment\nThe business\
      \ and operating models are both aligned on Pixar’s key competitive advantages:\
      \ creativity and quality. Pixar has become a consumer-facing brand associated\
      \ with a high level of creativity and quality — and they want to sustain this\
      \ brand identity to retain loyal audiences. To ensure that this production value\
      \ is being provided to customers, the production process is highly detail-oriented\
      \ and based on constant iteration, refinement, and team growth and learning.\
      \ A Harvard Business Review article even likened Pixar’s continuous improvement\
      \ model to that of Toyota’s “Kaizen” philosophy (6). The operating model also\
      \ supports the business model and decreases the risk of a very expensive film\
      \ failure by subjecting the work in process to constant quality control checks.\
      \ High levels of cooperation and sharing throughout the production process allows\
      \ for errors in storyline, dialogue, or visual effects to be caught early and\
      \ often — before the process is too far along for these problems to be fixed\
      \ (4). Though this increases the cycle time of the process (often only 2 seconds\
      \ of a film is worked on each day!), Pixar’s box office performance has shown\
      \ that the value gained from this process in quality and creativity added has\
      \ definitely paid off (7).\nSources Cited/Used:\nhttp://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=pixar.htm\n\

      Buzz Lightyear, I am your biggest fan!!! Nice post. Very interesting comparing\
      \ their operating model vs. the rest of Hollywood. I would imagine the reason\
      \ may be related to the criticality of software in teh production process… the\
      \ interface between creative and technical is much more integrative, which may\
      \ motivate keeping people aroudn to drive experience and learning in the more\
      \ complex setting… what do you think?\nDecember 14, 2015\t Buzz Lightyear says:\n\
      I think that the technology/software side of Pixar does have something to do\
      \ with it. Their approach often comes across as more scientific than artistic\
      \ to me. For example, they encourage their tech artists to regularly publish\
      \ articles and present at conferences so that they maintain a strong relationship\
      \ with the academic community.\nIt is interesting to note, however, that elsewhere\
      \ in Hollywood, smaller-scale creative alliances do form. For example, director\
      \ David O. Russell and actress Jennifer Lawrence have worked on multiple movies\
      \ such as Joy, American Hustle, and Silver Linings Playbook together. I also\
      \ saw JJ Abram’s long-time editors (since the show Alias) speak at the LA Film\
      \ Festival this summer, and they said have gotten to know his working style\
      \ over the years, and it seemed like they have refined and improved their working\
      \ processes over time. I am working in development at a production company this\
      \ summer, and hope to learn more about the different operating models happening\
      \ in film/TV and how creative teams form and function!\nhttp://www.filmindependent.org/blogs/j-j-abrams-long-time-editors-reveal-how-to-help-develop-characters-in-the-editing-room/#.Vm9jOxorLUo\n\

      December 14, 2015\t Lior says:\nI’m also a huge Pixar fan and appreciate how\
      \ they managed to create and sustain such a strong operating model (with clear\
      \ link to the business model – quality and creativity). We actually tried mimicking\
      \ this model as we evaluated marketing campaigns in P&G (we formed a community\
      \ of brain trust and made sure to share campaign progress with the entire team.\
      \ We also discussed the successes and failures of the process at the end of\
      \ the campaign). I personally think the idea of using Pixar model to build marketing\
      \ campaigns is a powerful one, but we lacked full commitment to the process.\n\
      Building on that… I was wondering what are your thoughts on using this model\
      \ for different industries? For example, the pharmaceutical industry would also\
      \ benefit from high quality “blockbuster” drugs as opposed to “mini-hits”.\n\
      This is very interesting. To be honest I didn’t know Pixar had a significantly\
      \ different positioning to other movie producers, but I did love most of their\
      \ movies. The different areas you described reminded me a lot the Design Thinking\
      \ process we learned in the IDEO case, with teams brainstorming and converging\
      \ during the day and then use the Incubator Team, Shared Dailies and the Creative\
      \ Brain Trust to validate and/or generate new ideas. I wonder whether they do\
      \ something similar with the target audience or if this limited to employees\
      \ within the company.\nDecember 14, 2015\t AClay says:\nGreat article! I wonder\
      \ if Pixar was able to keep its unique culture after the Disney buyout. Disney\
      \ has such a strong culture itself, that I would imagined that it would be hard\
      \ for Disney’s culture to not suffocate Pixar’s culture.\nAlso, Shared Dailies\
      \ sound freighting like Bridgewater’s immediate feedback model to me. I wonder\
      \ how direct their feedback is at Pixar."

    - "Pixar Animation Studios: Creative Kaizen\nBy HBSstudent11\nIliad S.A.: the\
      \ story behind France’s telecommunications maverick\nHow Pixar’s innovative\
      \ production process ensures creative quality for audiences\nPixar: A Winner\n\
      Pixar has been highly effective at aligning its business and operating models\
      \ to drive success. Founded 1986, Pixar has produced 16 feature animated films\
      \ which together have grossed almost $4 billion at the box office (1). Critically\
      \ acclaimed projects include: Toy Story, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, Up, and\
      \ Finding Nemo. Disney took notice of Pixar’s ability to churn out blockbusters,\
      \ and acquired them in 2006 (2). This ability seems to be driven by Pixar’s\
      \ unique model of organization, production, and talent retention.\nPixar makes\
      \ money by unifying art and technology to produce original animated films that\
      \ motivate audiences to buy movie tickets, DVDs, digital copies, and merchandise.\
      \ These films are marketed towards children, but have the emotional depth and\
      \ production quality to appeal to adults. Pixar’s key market differentiator\
      \ is its focus on quality. Instead of throwing out a portfolio of movies every\
      \ year and hoping that a few become blockbusters, Pixar makes big bets on a\
      \ fewer number of films, producing one film every four to five years. It minimizes\
      \ risk by ensuring the quality of these films via a highly monitored production\
      \ process.\nPixar has a very unique operating model compared to other film studios.\
      \ In other studios, new creative teams are formed around new film concepts and\
      \ then disbanded once the films are complete. Pixar takes a drastically different\
      \ approach and retains creative talent as long-term employees. This allows teams\
      \ to improve their skills and operating processes over time with increased repetition\
      \ (3). Pixar leaders believe that the initial idea matters a lot less than the\
      \ people who actually iterate and brainstorm around that idea throughout the\
      \ production process (4). Other key elements of Pixar’s successful operating\
      \ model include:\nIncubator Teams: When concepts are still nascent, small teams\
      \ of directors, writers, and artists serve as incubators that work together\
      \ to improve and expand on the initial ideas. This tests the idea, but also\
      \ serves as a way for teams to feel out their strengths and weaknesses and learn\
      \ how they should work together moving forward (4).\nShared Dailies: Every day,\
      \ directors and producers must show their daily work to everyone (instead of\
      \ just a small team like at other studios). All members of the crew are encouraged\
      \ to offer suggestions for improvement. Dailies serve as a great way to share\
      \ information with the entire team and break down departmental barriers (4).\n\
      Creative Brain Trust: This is a committee of creative leaders in the company\
      \ that directors/producers can access to help solve production problems. An\
      \ important and unique dynamic of this group is that, unlike traditional studio\
      \ development executives, the advisors of this committee have no authority.\
      \ Instead, they are peers whose purpose is solely to offer creative input and\
      \ advice (5).\nPostmortems: These are meetings that occur after a film is finished\
      \ and discuss the successes and failures of the process. This is critical for\
      \ the growth of the teams (as they will largely remain together to work on the\
      \ next Pixar film) and helps improve work output and processes for the future\
      \ (4).\nPixar University: The company offers classes across disciplines to foster\
      \ communication between departments and emphasize the idea of “learning and\
      \ growing together” (3).\nPixar Campus: The campus has an open plan that maximizes\
      \ interaction among colleagues during the workday to stimulate conversation\
      \ and free flow of ideas (3).\nBusiness and Operating Model Alignment\nThe business\
      \ and operating models are both aligned on Pixar’s key competitive advantages:\
      \ creativity and quality. Pixar has become a consumer-facing brand associated\
      \ with a high level of creativity and quality — and they want to sustain this\
      \ brand identity to retain loyal audiences. To ensure that this production value\
      \ is being provided to customers, the production process is highly detail-oriented\
      \ and based on constant iteration, refinement, and team growth and learning.\
      \ A Harvard Business Review article even likened Pixar’s continuous improvement\
      \ model to that of Toyota’s “Kaizen” philosophy (6). The operating model also\
      \ supports the business model and decreases the risk of a very expensive film\
      \ failure by subjecting the work in process to constant quality control checks.\
      \ High levels of cooperation and sharing throughout the production process allows\
      \ for errors in storyline, dialogue, or visual effects to be caught early and\
      \ often — before the process is too far along for these problems to be fixed\
      \ (4). Though this increases the cycle time of the process (often only 2 seconds\
      \ of a film is worked on each day!), Pixar’s box office performance has shown\
      \ that the value gained from this process in quality and creativity added has\
      \ definitely paid off (7).\nSources Cited/Used:\nhttp://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=pixar.htm\n\

      \ \U0001F642 I really appreciated reading about all the steps they take to ensure\

      Buzz Lightyear, I am your biggest fan!!! Nice post. Very interesting comparing\
      \ their operating model vs. the rest of Hollywood. I would imagine the reason\
      \ may be related to the criticality of software in teh production process… the\
      \ interface between creative and technical is much more integrative, which may\
      \ motivate keeping people aroudn to drive experience and learning in the more\
      \ complex setting… what do you think?\nDecember 14, 2015\t Buzz Lightyear says:\n\
      I think that the technology/software side of Pixar does have something to do\
      \ with it. Their approach often comes across as more scientific than artistic\
      \ to me. For example, they encourage their tech artists to regularly publish\
      \ articles and present at conferences so that they maintain a strong relationship\
      \ with the academic community.\nIt is interesting to note, however, that elsewhere\
      \ in Hollywood, smaller-scale creative alliances do form. For example, director\
      \ David O. Russell and actress Jennifer Lawrence have worked on multiple movies\
      \ such as Joy, American Hustle, and Silver Linings Playbook together. I also\
      \ saw JJ Abram’s long-time editors (since the show Alias) speak at the LA Film\
      \ Festival this summer, and they said have gotten to know his working style\
      \ over the years, and it seemed like they have refined and improved their working\
      \ processes over time. I am working in development at a production company this\
      \ summer, and hope to learn more about the different operating models happening\
      \ in film/TV and how creative teams form and function!\nhttp://www.filmindependent.org/blogs/j-j-abrams-long-time-editors-reveal-how-to-help-develop-characters-in-the-editing-room/#.Vm9jOxorLUo\n\

      December 14, 2015\t Lior says:\nI’m also a huge Pixar fan and appreciate how\
      \ they managed to create and sustain such a strong operating model (with clear\
      \ link to the business model – quality and creativity). We actually tried mimicking\
      \ this model as we evaluated marketing campaigns in P&G (we formed a community\
      \ of brain trust and made sure to share campaign progress with the entire team.\
      \ We also discussed the successes and failures of the process at the end of\
      \ the campaign). I personally think the idea of using Pixar model to build marketing\
      \ campaigns is a powerful one, but we lacked full commitment to the process.\n\
      Building on that… I was wondering what are your thoughts on using this model\
      \ for different industries? For example, the pharmaceutical industry would also\
      \ benefit from high quality “blockbuster” drugs as opposed to “mini-hits”.\n\
      This is very interesting. To be honest I didn’t know Pixar had a significantly\
      \ different positioning to other movie producers, but I did love most of their\
      \ movies. The different areas you described reminded me a lot the Design Thinking\
      \ process we learned in the IDEO case, with teams brainstorming and converging\
      \ during the day and then use the Incubator Team, Shared Dailies and the Creative\
      \ Brain Trust to validate and/or generate new ideas. I wonder whether they do\
      \ something similar with the target audience or if this limited to employees\

      \ if Pixar was able to keep its unique culture after the Disney buyout. Disney\
      \ has such a strong culture itself, that I would imagined that it would be hard\
      \ for Disney’s culture to not suffocate Pixar’s culture.\nAlso, Shared Dailies\

      It is neat to see how they progressed in the series with the quality.

      You''re right. The quality of all of Pixar''s movies have increased over the
      years. This is due, in no small part, to the fact that they have long term teams
      that work together on multiple projects. Further, Pixar, as a company, cares

      Toy Story 2 Was Accidentally Deleted During Development and Almost Lost

      During development at Pixar, Toy Story 2 was accidentally deleted, but was recovered
      by an employee who saved the movie to her computer at home while on maternal
      leave.

      Topics: Pixar, Toy Story, Unbelievable, Movie, FIlm, Accident

      It s a movie studio s worst nightmare; losing a movie in development that s
      cost hundreds of man hours and a significant amount more in financial terms,
      but that s exactly what happened to the guys at Pixar who were working on the
      sequel to the 90s hit, Toy Story.

      The former Chief Technical Officer of Pixar, Oren Jacob, recounts the ordeal:

      [Larry Cutler] was in that directory and happened to be talking about installing
      a fix to Woody or Woody’s hat. He looked at the directory and it had like 40
      files, and he looked again and it had four files.

      Then we saw sequences start to vanish as well and we were like, “Oh my god”

      I grabbed the phone…  unplug the machine!”

      One of his co-workers had issued an over-reaching command to the studio s server
      to try to fix a simple, benign problem, but instead, ended up recursively deleting
      large chunks of the movie itselt - approximately two months worth of work.

      This triggered a huge effort by the Pixar team to recover what was lost. They
      were in luck as one of the staff members had a copy of the movie on their computer
      at home.

      Interestingly, this wasn t the last time that Toy Story 2 was deleted. In fact,
      with only months to go until a set-in-stone release date, serving as testament
      to Pixar s commitment to quality, the whole film was binned and re-made.

      its own good

      4That is a crazy story. Someone totally deleted Toy Story 2 while it was in
      development (the result of a badly written program that just started deleting
      files on their server). But, the project was saved because a woman, who was
      on maternit6y leave, had saved the movie onto her laptop.  I am sure thy have
      fixed their back up systems after this.'

      The Cast of Pixar s Fantasy Adventure, Onward

      Like a new film from Marvel or another episode of STAR WARS, a new Pixar movie
      isn’t just a new animated movie for kids: it’s an event. The studio behind some
      of the greatest animated films of the past 20 years, including TOY STORY, WALL-E,
      and MONSTERS, INC. is back this year with an all-new adventure that takes audiences
      into a world beyond the limits of our imagination.

      ONWARD introduces young (and young-at-heart) viewers to a wonderful land where
      mythical creatures like elves and unicorns aren t merely real — they re the
      primary residents! There s trouble brewing, however. Technology is taking hold
      and the world is losing its magic. The land is in need of some serious help,
      and who’s more helpful than a pair of elves? How about a pair of elves voiced
      by Marvel super-stars Chris Pratt and Tom Holland?

      Pratt and Holland aren’t the only famous voices you’ll hear in Pixar’s latest.
      Read on for our handy guide to the fantastic and familiar voices of ONWARD.

      [Image credit: Pixar Animation Studios]

      Pixar’s all-new animated adventure is set in a fictional realm that isn’t too
      different from our own: There are suburbs and trash collectors, businesses big
      and small, schools and transportation. There’s just one thing: This world is
      magic, and its inhabitants are the creatures that we think of as mythical.

      But magic isn’t as easy to use as it once was, and the population has become
      increasingly dependent on technology and science to get things done. Instead
      of using magic, the creatures in this world are turning to cars and phones and
      other science-based devices, taking them further and further away from magic.
      And this surprisingly relatable situation is where our story begins… and where
      our heroes enter the picture.

      Meet Ian and Barley Lightfoot

      Ian and Barley are teenage elves who, like most creatures in their society,
      have become a little too dependent on technology and modern machinery. Then
      their mother gifts them with a magical staff that can bring a lost loved one
      back to life for 24 hours. Even though the brothers aren’t well-versed in wielding
      magical equipment, they use it to try and bring back their father, who died
      before Ian was born. Due to their lack of experience, they’re only able to summon
      their dad’s legs. Barley, desperate for an epic quest, grabs Ian and they set
      off on a journey to figure out how to bring their dad back – all of him – before
      the day ends.

      Ian is voiced by Tom Holland, star of the new SPIDER-MAN movies and historical
      drama THE CURRENT WAR. He also recently lent his voice to another animated movie:
      SPIES IN DISGUISE. In 2020, Holland will reunite with another MCU favorite,
      voicing Pip the dog opposite Robert Downey Jr.’s Doctor Dolittle in DOLITTLE.

      Barley is voiced by GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY fave Chris Pratt, who has plenty
      of experience voicing a charming animated hero thanks to his role in THE LEGO
      MOVIE and its sequel.

      Laurel Lightfoot

      Laurel is the mother of Ian and Barley, and she gives the magical staff to her
      sons in an effort to help them reconnect with magic. She’s played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus,
      one of the all-time greatest comedic actors. Louis-Dreyfus is best known for
      her roles in beloved sitcoms like “Seinfeld” and “The New Adventures of Old
      Christine.” She also played the lead role on HBO’s critically-acclaimed political
      comedy series “Veep,” which recently ended after seven seasons.

      Octavia Spencer plays Corey, a friendly manticore who owns a restaurant. Barley
      and Ian visit her for help on their quest. Spencer won an Oscar for her supporting
      role in 2011’s THE HELP, and since then she’s had notable roles in all kinds
      of movies and shows – everything from SNOWPIERCER to THE SHAPE OF WATER and
      last year’s horror-thriller MA, as well as the new AppleTV+ series “Truth Be
      Told.”

      Gore and Specter

      Gore (not like the gore in a horror movie) is a faun – a magical deer, basically
      – and a police officer. She’s voiced by comedian Ali Wong, who became a major
      hit with her Netflix specials “Baby Cobra” and “Hard Knock Wife.” Last year
      she starred opposite Randall Park in the delightful Netflix rom-com ALWAYS BE
      MY MAYBE, which featured an internet-breaking cameo from Keanu Reeves.

      Like Gore, Specter is also a police officer, but she’s a cyclops – a creature
      with a single eye. Specter is voiced by Lena Waithe, whose work as co-star and
      writer on Netflix’s “Master of None” launched her into the mainstream overnight
      and won her a Primetime Emmy – making Waithe the first black woman to win a
      writing Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series. Waithe has used her fame to produce
      other projects, like the recent drama QUEEN & SLIM and the Showtime series “The
      Chi.” She also had a supporting role in Steven Spielberg’s READY PLAYER ONE.

      Colt Bronco

      Joining Gore and Specter on the magical police force is Colt Bronco, a centaur
      (half-horse, half-human) who, honestly, has a very cool name. Colt is voiced
      by Mel Rodriguez, a character actor best known in recent years for starring
      on the short-lived FOX series “The Last Man on Earth” and AMC’s “Better Call
      Saul.” In 2019 he starred opposite Kirsten Dunst on the critically-acclaimed
      series “On Becoming a God in Central Florida.”

      and small, schools and transportation. There’s just one thing: This world is
      magic, and its inhabitants are the creatures that we think of as mythical.

      But magic isn’t as easy to use as it once was, and the population has become
      increasingly dependent on technology and science to get things done. Instead
      of using magic, the creatures in this world are turning to cars and phones and
      other science-based devices, taking them further and further away from magic.
      And this surprisingly relatable situation is where our story begins… and where
      our heroes enter the picture.

      Meet Ian and Barley Lightfoot

      Ian and Barley are teenage elves who, like most creatures in their society,
      have become a little too dependent on technology and modern machinery. Then
      their mother gifts them with a magical staff that can bring a lost loved one
      back to life for 24 hours. Even though the brothers aren’t well-versed in wielding
      magical equipment, they use it to try and bring back their father, who died
      before Ian was born. Due to their lack of experience, they’re only able to summon
      their dad’s legs. Barley, desperate for an epic quest, grabs Ian and they set
      off on a journey to figure out how to bring their dad back – all of him – before
      the day ends.

      Ian is voiced by Tom Holland, star of the new SPIDER-MAN movies and historical
      drama THE CURRENT WAR. He also recently lent his voice to another animated movie:
      SPIES IN DISGUISE. In 2020, Holland will reunite with another MCU favorite,
      voicing Pip the dog opposite Robert Downey Jr.’s Doctor Dolittle in DOLITTLE.

      Barley is voiced by GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY fave Chris Pratt, who has plenty
      of experience voicing a charming animated hero thanks to his role in THE LEGO
      MOVIE and its sequel.

      Laurel Lightfoot

      Laurel is the mother of Ian and Barley, and she gives the magical staff to her
      sons in an effort to help them reconnect with magic. She’s played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus,
      one of the all-time greatest comedic actors. Louis-Dreyfus is best known for
      her roles in beloved sitcoms like “Seinfeld” and “The New Adventures of Old
      Christine.” She also played the lead role on HBO’s critically-acclaimed political
      comedy series “Veep,” which recently ended after seven seasons.

      Octavia Spencer plays Corey, a friendly manticore who owns a restaurant. Barley
      and Ian visit her for help on their quest. Spencer won an Oscar for her supporting
      role in 2011’s THE HELP, and since then she’s had notable roles in all kinds
      of movies and shows – everything from SNOWPIERCER to THE SHAPE OF WATER and
      last year’s horror-thriller MA, as well as the new AppleTV+ series “Truth Be
      Told.”

      Gore and Specter

      Gore (not like the gore in a horror movie) is a faun – a magical deer, basically
      – and a police officer. She’s voiced by comedian Ali Wong, who became a major
      hit with her Netflix specials “Baby Cobra” and “Hard Knock Wife.” Last year
      she starred opposite Randall Park in the delightful Netflix rom-com ALWAYS BE
      MY MAYBE, which featured an internet-breaking cameo from Keanu Reeves.

      Like Gore, Specter is also a police officer, but she’s a cyclops – a creature
      with a single eye. Specter is voiced by Lena Waithe, whose work as co-star and
      writer on Netflix’s “Master of None” launched her into the mainstream overnight
      and won her a Primetime Emmy – making Waithe the first black woman to win a
      writing Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series. Waithe has used her fame to produce
      other projects, like the recent drama QUEEN & SLIM and the Showtime series “The
      Chi.” She also had a supporting role in Steven Spielberg’s READY PLAYER ONE.

      Colt Bronco

      Joining Gore and Specter on the magical police force is Colt Bronco, a centaur
      (half-horse, half-human) who, honestly, has a very cool name. Colt is voiced
      by Mel Rodriguez, a character actor best known in recent years for starring
      on the short-lived FOX series “The Last Man on Earth” and AMC’s “Better Call
      Saul.” In 2019 he starred opposite Kirsten Dunst on the critically-acclaimed
      series “On Becoming a God in Central Florida.”

      ONWARD opens on March 6!

      I like going to the moives.

      I love to get the overpriced snacks.

      Have you seen any good movies lately?

      I have. I liked Toy Story. There was a marathon.

      All four movies in the Toy Story series are great. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and
      Don Rickles are all truly great actors and the creativity of the Pixar Animation
      Studios team is really top notch.

      It is neat to see how they progressed in the series with the quality.

      You''re right. The quality of all of Pixar''s movies have increased over the
      years. This is due, in no small part, to the fact that they have long term teams
      that work together on multiple projects. Further, Pixar, as a company, cares
      more about creating high quality movies than they do making the most money possible.
      This is their company''s culture and the reason for their continuing success.

      I once heard someone erased progress on it like a saved file but someone had
      it on their laptop or something.

      4That is a crazy story. Someone totally deleted Toy Story 2 while it was in
      development (the result of a badly written program that just started deleting
      files on their server). But, the project was saved because a woman, who was
      on maternit6y leave, had saved the movie onto her laptop.  I am sure thy have
      fixed their back up systems after this.

      Yes! and I remember now that is how that story goes.

      Pixar has produced 20 movies since its founding and all of the big names have
      worked with them. Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tom Holland, Jon Batiste, Phylicia Rashad,
      Questlove, Tina Fey.  Have you seen their newest movie Onward with Chris Pratt?'

    - 'Critics Accuse Pixar s  Inside Out  of Body Shaming, Internet Promptly Freaks
      Out

      Is this beloved character s appearance sending a dangerous message?

      Anyone who s seen Pixar s most recent movie Inside Out probs left the theater
      crying their eyes out. The movie, about an 11-year -old girl named Riley s emotions
      battling with one another about how to deal with being uprooted from her home
      and moving to a new city, captures perfectly what you felt dealing with life
      as an 11 years old kid.

      The movie has been getting stellar reviews from most, but one negative review
      has sparked a lot of controversy. In an article for the Huffington Post, critic
      Joni Edelman claims that Inside Out fails at body positivity. Her issue with
      the movie is that while the character that represents the positive emotion joy
      (who s name is obvs Joy) is thin, tall, and human-like, Sadness (an emotion
      we typically think of as negative) is a short, round, bespectacled, and blue...thing(?).

      In the review, she explains why she finds this portrayal of sadness offensive:

      Probably because someone at Pixar thinks fat people are sad. Because they are
      fat. And how could they be fat and smile? Fat people have some nerve. Also,
      their poor vision is apparently causing them some distress. Joy doesn t wear
      glasses. She probably had Lasik. Because she is probably also rich. Rich, white
      (well, white-ish) people are also joyous. And she gets to wear a cute little
      dress, which she probably bought at Nordstrom, while Sad is shrouded in what
      is probably an itchy-ass thrifted wool sweater. Maybe that s why she s named
      Sad.

      Joni s critique promptly went viral, with most fans of the movie slamming the
      review, especially because, well, she never watched the movie.

      A real, honest to God review of  Inside Out,  written by someone who hasn t

      Many felt the review was counterproductive, because it was stereotyping Sadness  appearance
      as being bad because she happened to be shorter and not as thin as the other
      characters, when, in fact, Sadness was actually *SPOILER ALERT* the integral
      emotion that ended up saving the day.

      Joy was annoyed with Sadness throughout the movie, because she was making Riley,
      well, sad about moving. But at the end of the day, Joy realized that she was
      making Riley worse by trying to force her to be happy and had to let Riley be
      sad in order for her to deal with her emotions in a healthy way.

      Other commenters believed that the reviewer was simply missing the fact that
      each emotion was shaped like something representative of that emotion, saying
      that Sadness wasn t  fat , but rounded, like a teardrop. One commenter shared,  Joy
      is a star... Anger is a fire brick, Disgust is broccoli, Fear is a frayed nerve,
      and Sadness is a tear.

      Others defended Jodi s review, saying Sadness  shape sends a harmful message.  It
      s clear from the image that sadness equals a fat woman wearing glasses. This
      image reinforces stereotypes, whatever the content of the movie. It s not that
      sadness isn t a useful, normal human emotion, it s the assumption that the saddest
      thing you can be is a fat woman with glasses. The image they have chosen undercuts
      any statement they may have wished to make in the movie,  according to one commenter
      on a review rebutting Edelman s.

      Whether the reviewer was wrong or right in her assessment, she did open up a
      super important discussion about body image representation in movies that will
      hopefully inspire filmmakers to think about the messages we may be (intentionally
      or unintentionally) sending about body image and appearance, even in Pixar movies.
