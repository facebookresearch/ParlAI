    - 'Yes, I agree. Some of the ingredients I''ve never heard of. I try to watch
      as many as I can, but not all. I only imagine what I would make. I have never
      tried by myself. '
    text: It sounds like quite a challenge! Do you watch every episode? Have you tried
      to make the dishes yourself?

      depending on the round. The cuisine is from around the world. Fine dining to
      street style. '
    text: 'I think it would be a big challenge to do what Chefs on the program do.
      Is there a type of cuisine that they normally feature? Or it it cuisine from

    - Yes, it really is. I enjoy that there is no story line, so anyone can start
      watching and not feel like they missed an important part of the plot. Yes, it
      is a foodie favorite. I am a foodie, yes. But I'm also picky.
    text: That sounds interesting! I bet the show is pretty popular with foodies!
