    - 'Types of Cuisine From Around the World With Their Popular Foods

      Most countries and regions in the world have their own particular cuisine. Different
      types of cuisines involve certain cooking practices, local ingredients, and
      a combination of spices. Some food cultures are a fusion of foods from different
      countries. From these, delicious foods have developed that provide unique culinary
      experiences.

      There are hundreds of different cuisines in the world. Famous cuisines in the
      world include French, Thai, Italian, Indian, and Chinese. In large cities, it
      is also not uncommon to find restaurants serving dishes from Moroccan, Lebanese,
      Vietnamese, and Hungarian cuisines.

      Even in countries that have their own particular kind of cuisine, it is not
      uncommon to have regional variations. For example, some types of food may be
      prepared in different ways or include a different variety of ingredients.

      In this article, you will learn about some of the top cuisines in the world.
      You will also find out where some famous dishes originated from.

      The French Provencal cuisine uses a lot of herbs

      Many regard French cuisine as one of the best cuisines in the world. French
      food involves ingredients such as butter, cream, wine, herbs, chocolate, and
      vegetables. French pastry dishes, cheese, bread, and wine are famous throughout
      the world.

      Food culture in France also revolves around locally sourced ingredients. On
      the Mediterranean coast, seafood is very popular. Provencal cuisine uses tarragon
      and a host of other herbs and spices. Paris itself has over 9,000 restaurants
      serving French classics and dishes from around the world.

      Dumplings and dim sum are a common food in the Chinese cuisine

      Chinese cuisine is one of the most diverse food cultures in the world. Traditionally,
      Chinese food is served with noodles or rice. Also, Chinese dumplings form a
      large part of the staple diet in many regions of China. There are several main
      cuisines in Chinese cookery – Cantonese, Sichuan, Fujian, and Hunan cuisines
      are the most well-known.

      Most Chinese dishes contain a mixture of vegetables that are stir-fried and
      combined with aromatic spices and herbs. For example, ginger is often fried
      along with garlic and onions to create flavorsome dishes. Also, soy sauce, rice
      vinegar, and fish sauce are commonly used to create a blend of wonderful flavors.

      Chinese cuisine could be regarded as the one of the most important in the world.
      Chinese cooking styles have influenced other foods from Korea, the Philippines,
      Thailand, and Vietnam. Chinese dishes are so popular that most cities in the
      world have a number of Chinese restaurants. Sweet and sour chicken and chop
      suey are the most popular Chinese dishes outside of China.

      Sushi is a very popular food in Japanese restaurants

      Japanese dishes have become one of the most important food genres in the world.
      Boiled rice usually accompanies most dishes with grilled fish, pickled vegetables,
      or deep-fried vegetables. Tofu also plays an important part in traditional Japanese
      cuisine.

      Of course, sushi is one of the most well-known type of Japanese food. Great
      care and precision goes into creating delicious rice rolls with raw fish, vegetables,
      and nori. These are accompanied with pickled ginger and dipping sauces. Japanese
      food culture is so influential that many countries around the world developed
      their own type of sushi varieties.

      Going into a Japanese restaurant, you often see the chef working in an open
      kitchen at a Teppanyaki grill.

      After your delicious Japanese meal, you can finish off with a cup of refreshing
      type of tea such as: green tea, oolong tea, or jasmine tea.

      Pasta dishes are one of the most famous foods in Italian cuisine

      Many people regard Italy as the country with the best food in the world. Pasta
      dishes in Italian cuisine are one of the most popular and favorite types of
      food in the world. There are very few people in the world who haven’t tried
      delicious Italian foods like pizza, spaghetti, or delicious Italian ice cream.
      Many classic Italian dishes also include the regional name in their title. For
      example, spaghetti Bolognese from Bologna and Parma ham or Parmesan cheese from
      Parma.

      The mainstays of the popular Italian cuisine are pasta, rice, tomatoes, and
      cheese. Many regional variations include types of meat, seafood, or sausages
      along with delicious sauces. These can be flavored with herbs such as oregano,
      basil, or a combination of other fresh herbs.

      There is also great variation in food cultures between the various regions of
      Italy. Abruzzo cuisine from the mountainous and coastal regions has pasta, seafood,
      lamb, and wild mushrooms. Neapolitan cuisine is famous for foods like pizzas,
      spaghetti, and mozzarella. Famous Italian dishes such as lasagna, tortellini,
      and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese are from areas around Bologna and Modena.

      Greek salad is a favorite food for Greek cuisine lovers

      Greek food culture is one of the oldest in the world. Cuisine from Greece and
      the Greek islands is heavily influenced by olive oil, vegetables, fish, and
      various types of meat. In fact, a simple Greek salad may just be fresh cucumbers,
      tomatoes, red onions, a dash of olive oil, a few tasty olives, and a thick slice
      of feta cheese.

      Some popular Greek dishes include moussaka made from eggplant, tzatziki (a type
      of yogurt dip), or gyro – a type of kebab with lamb, pork, or chicken meat.
      Due to its long coastline, seafood such as squid, mussels, fish, and lobster
      are popular food choices.

      After feasting on Greek delicacies, you may have room for some common Greek
      desserts. A delicious filo pastry with layers of nuts and honey called baklava
      is one of the most favorite Greek sweet foods.

      Seafood paella is a popular dish served in many Spanish restaurants

      Similar to many countries around the Mediterranean Sea, Spanish cuisine is heavily
      influenced by seafood. A combination of mussels, cuttlefish, shrimps, and lobster
      together with paprika, saffron and rich broth create the classic seafood paella.

      Spanish food culture isn’t limited just to seafood. This popular cuisine also
      includes foods like cured meats such as Serrano or Iberico ham. Chorizo sausage,
      mushrooms, and cooked meat are used in Spanish appetizers – tapas.

      Different regions of Spain also have culinary variations. For example, La Rioja
      is famous for its red wine, cured pork, and lamb dishes. Seafood, thyme soup,
      and bean omelets are popular in Catalan cuisine. Andalusia is famous for hot
      soups, fish stews, and cold soups such as gazpacho.

      Olive oil is a staple ingredient in the Mediterranean cuisine

      It can be difficult to define what exactly Mediterranean cuisine is as there
      is great variety of dishes in it. The key ingredients of Mediterranean cuisine
      are basic foods such as olive oil, fresh vegetables, wheat (such as bread and
      pasta), and grape (such as wine).

      Mediterranean food styles include culinary delicacies from countries such as
      Morocco, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Turkey, and the Middle East.

      Mediterranean food culture is also the basis of the Mediterranean diet. This
      kind of diet contains olive oil, fresh vegetables and fruits, seafood, and nuts.

      Hummus dip with pita bread is a common type of food served in many Lebanese
      restaurants

      Lebanese food culture comprises cuisines from other Mediterranean countries.
      Poultry, seafood, lamb, or goat meat are prepared with olive oil, garlic, and
      other spices. These are usually consumed with pitta bread and fresh or grilled
      vegetables.

      Chickpeas also form a staple part of Lebanese cuisine. These are cooked and
      blended with olive oil, tahini, and lemon juice to create a delicious nutty
      hummus dip.

      As well as classic Mediterranean desserts such as baklava or halva, fresh or
      dried types of dates are also widely used in Lebanese sweet dishes.

      A vegetable couscous is served in Moroccan tagine

      Moroccan dishes are a great example of when different cuisines fuse to form
      a new type of food genre. Moroccan cuisine uses a goat, lamb, poultry, beef,
      and seafood as its basis. These meats are spiced and cooked along with lemons,
      dried fruits, and olive oil.

      One of the most famous foods in the popular Moroccan cuisine is couscous. This
      common wheat-based food is combined with various spices, herbs, and vegetables
      to create a versatile and delicious side dish. Another favorite Moroccan classic
      dish is a tagine. This is an earthenware dish used to cook meat along with vegetables
      or dried fruits.

      As with many dishes in North Africa, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean,
      Moroccan cuisine uses flatbread as a meal accompaniment.

      Lamb kebab is a popular type of dish in the Turkish cuisine

      Turkish food is another example of a fusion of various food cultures from Asia,
      Europe, and the Middle East. Eggplant, stuffed dolmas, lamb kebabs, and delicious
      vegetable stews are just some of the culinary delights you can experience with
      Turkish food. Nuts such as hazelnuts, walnuts, and chestnuts are common food
      ingredients in savory and sweet dishes.

      One important part of Turkish cuisine is yogurt. In fact, the name ‘yogurt’
      is a Turkish word. Yogurt and types of spiced yogurt are an accompaniment to
      many vegetable and meat dishes in Turkey. Cheese made from sheep’s milk is another
      important dairy product in Turkish cuisine.

      Popular beverages in Turkey include strong Turkish coffee, hot black tea, and
      Ayran – a type of yogurt drink.

      Pad Thai is a famous and delicious dish to try when visiting Thailand

      Thai cuisine is all about strong spicy flavors that incorporate sweet, sour,
      and hot elements. Some of the world’s most popular dishes are from Thailand.
      Pad Thai, green curry, and tom yum goong are just some examples of the best
      dishes from Thailand.

      Thai food is traditionally served with rice or noodles. Even spicy Thai soups
      or broths usually contain basic rice noodles.

      One of the unique features of Thai cuisine is its wide use of spices, herbs,
      and sauces. For example, fresh basil, lemongrass, kaffir lime, chilies, and
      coconut milk are some of the ingredients in Thai green curry. Also, cloves,
      ginger, cilantro, mint, and turmeric are common ingredients.

      Trying many of the different dishes in Thailand is usually a culinary experience
      that few people forget.

      Samosas may take different fillings and forms, depending on the region in India

      When it comes to spicy, aromatic dishes, Indian cuisine usually tops the list.
      The amazing range of spices, chilies, and herbs combine to make some of the
      spiciest foods you can eat.

      In India, the range of different cuisines is also impressive. Each region in
      India has its own ethnic foods and dishes. These can include vegetable pastry
      morsels such as samosas, vegetarian curries, beans with fermented fish, and
      vegetable pakoras.

      Street food is also part of the food culture in India. Tandoori chicken served
      with basic naan bread, spicy Indian snacks, and sweet dishes such as Gulab jamun
      are all popular.

      Indian cuisine has also been exported to many countries throughout the world.
      In countries like the United Kingdom, the US, Australia, and Singapore, Indian
      cuisine has been adapted to local culture.

      Crawfish dishes are very common in many restaurants in Louisiana

      Cajun food is an important part of American cuisine and is another example of
      ‘fusion cuisine.’ French cuisine combined with local ingredients in Louisiana
      has created many of the scrumptious dishes in Cajun cooking.

      Most Cajun dishes are prepared in pots. Seafood, crawfish, shrimps, vegetables,
      and steamed rice are the most common ingredients. Celery, bell peppers, citrus
      fruits, and okra are some of the fruits and vegetables common in Cajun food.

      Cajun cuisine is closely related to Creole cuisine. Gumbo is probably the signature
      dish of both cuisines.

      Taco is a traditional Mexican dish made of tortilla folded around a variety
      of fillings

      Another of the most popular types of cuisines in the world is Mexican food.
      Tacos, enchiladas, tortillas, nachos, and quesadillas are now common dishes
      in many countries around the world. Mexican food is also a popular street food
      as it’s easy to wrap delicious spicy meat, salsas, and vegetables in tortas
      or tortillas.

      Visiting an authentic Mexican restaurant provides an amazing choice of delicious
      dishes. Ethnic Mexican food can include grilled goat, meat with eggs, exotic
      fruits, and hot spicy dishes. Authentic Mexican avocado guacamole is absolutely
      delicious.

      Traditional Mexican cuisine is much different from the ‘Tex-Mex’ type of Mexican
      food that is popular in many countries.

      Jerk is a traditional cooking style in the Caribbean cuisine. In the photo:

      Traditional Caribbean dishes are a combination of African, European, Cajun,
      and Middle Eastern cuisines. Fusing cooking styles from these countries along
      with local ingredients has created a unique food culture.

      Rice is the staple ingredient in most Caribbean dishes. Local ingredients such
      as coconuts, plantains, beans, tomatoes, and chickpeas are used to create tasty
      meals. The addition of fiery chilies such as Scotch bonnet peppers gives many
      Caribbean dishes a powerful kick.

      The most famous food in the Caribbean cuisine is oven-baked Jerk Chicken. This
      is a spicy dish combining chicken, habanero peppers, ginger, garlic, herbs,
      and spices.

      Although Caribbean cuisine defines many dishes from the islands, each island
      has its own food culture.

      Bratwurst is a type of German sausage most commonly made of pork

      German cuisine is famous for its sausages called Wurst in German. There are
      an estimated over 1,500 different types of German sausage. However, German food
      isn’t all about bratwurst. There are many flavorful dishes in German cuisine.

      German specialties include German fries, sauerkraut, rye bread, Spätzle (a type
      of noodle), and dumplings. Popular German desserts include donuts (without a
      hole), Black Forest cake, and Rote Grütze (a delicious berry fruit pudding).

      Of course, Germany is also well-known for its beer such as pilsner and wheat
      beer.

      Borscht is a soup common in Eastern Europe countries. Made with beetroots, it
      has a typical red color

      Russia has a wide and varied food culture due to many culinary influences from
      its different regions. Due to the harsh climate, soups and stews play an important
      role in Russian cuisine. Thick spicy meat broths, noodle soups, and cabbage
      soups are very popular. A popular type of Russian soup is borscht that contains
      beets, cabbage, beef, and eaten with sour cream.

      Grains are another important part of Russian food. For example, buckwheat, barley
      and millet are all used as accompaniments to main meals. Beef Stroganoff, meatballs,
      and a type of Shish kebab are popular meat dishes.

      Even though it has become more expensive, caviar still enjoyed by many people
      in Russia.

      Goulash is enjoyed not only in Hungary but around the world

      Similar to Russian food, Hungarian cuisine is a mixture of soups and stews.
      Maybe the most famous Hungarian dish is goulash made with meat and spicy paprika.
      This classic Hungarian meal can be served as a soup or a stew.

      Similar to many countries in Europe, Hungarian cuisine has been influenced by
      surrounding countries. Therefore, crepes, sweet dumplings, stuffed cabbage rolls,
      and sausages are all found on traditional Hungarian menus.

      Hot dog is a popular street food across USA

      American cuisine has absorbed the cultures of many who came to the United States
      in the 1800s. A fusion of cooking styles, cuisines, and ethnic foods combined
      to create a new type of cuisine. Many chefs took traditional dishes from their
      home countries and put their own twist on them.

      For example, pizza is traditional Italian food. But ‘Chicago’ pizza has a thicker
      and taller crust, whereas ‘New York Slice’ is thinner. A ‘New York Strip Steak’
      is known in other countries as sirloin or contre-filet steak.

      Hamburgers, hot dogs, ‘French fries,’ fried chicken, and deep-pan pizzas are
      new takes on traditional foods from other countries. However, they are all part
      of the list of foods belonging to American cuisine.

    - 'Types of Cuisine From Around the World With Their Popular Foods

      Most countries and regions in the world have their own particular cuisine. Different
      types of cuisines involve certain cooking practices, local ingredients, and
      a combination of spices. Some food cultures are a fusion of foods from different
      countries. From these, delicious foods have developed that provide unique culinary
      experiences.

      There are hundreds of different cuisines in the world. Famous cuisines in the
      world include French, Thai, Italian, Indian, and Chinese. In large cities, it
      is also not uncommon to find restaurants serving dishes from Moroccan, Lebanese,
      Vietnamese, and Hungarian cuisines.

      Even in countries that have their own particular kind of cuisine, it is not
      uncommon to have regional variations. For example, some types of food may be
      prepared in different ways or include a different variety of ingredients.

      In this article, you will learn about some of the top cuisines in the world.
      You will also find out where some famous dishes originated from.

      The French Provencal cuisine uses a lot of herbs

      Many regard French cuisine as one of the best cuisines in the world. French
      food involves ingredients such as butter, cream, wine, herbs, chocolate, and
      vegetables. French pastry dishes, cheese, bread, and wine are famous throughout
      the world.

      Food culture in France also revolves around locally sourced ingredients. On
      the Mediterranean coast, seafood is very popular. Provencal cuisine uses tarragon
      and a host of other herbs and spices. Paris itself has over 9,000 restaurants
      serving French classics and dishes from around the world.

      Dumplings and dim sum are a common food in the Chinese cuisine

      Chinese cuisine is one of the most diverse food cultures in the world. Traditionally,
      Chinese food is served with noodles or rice. Also, Chinese dumplings form a
      large part of the staple diet in many regions of China. There are several main
      cuisines in Chinese cookery – Cantonese, Sichuan, Fujian, and Hunan cuisines
      are the most well-known.

      Most Chinese dishes contain a mixture of vegetables that are stir-fried and
      combined with aromatic spices and herbs. For example, ginger is often fried
      along with garlic and onions to create flavorsome dishes. Also, soy sauce, rice
      vinegar, and fish sauce are commonly used to create a blend of wonderful flavors.

      Chinese cuisine could be regarded as the one of the most important in the world.
      Chinese cooking styles have influenced other foods from Korea, the Philippines,
      Thailand, and Vietnam. Chinese dishes are so popular that most cities in the
      world have a number of Chinese restaurants. Sweet and sour chicken and chop
      suey are the most popular Chinese dishes outside of China.

      Sushi is a very popular food in Japanese restaurants

      Japanese dishes have become one of the most important food genres in the world.
      Boiled rice usually accompanies most dishes with grilled fish, pickled vegetables,
      or deep-fried vegetables. Tofu also plays an important part in traditional Japanese
      cuisine.

      Of course, sushi is one of the most well-known type of Japanese food. Great
      care and precision goes into creating delicious rice rolls with raw fish, vegetables,
      and nori. These are accompanied with pickled ginger and dipping sauces. Japanese
      food culture is so influential that many countries around the world developed
      their own type of sushi varieties.

      Going into a Japanese restaurant, you often see the chef working in an open
      kitchen at a Teppanyaki grill.

      After your delicious Japanese meal, you can finish off with a cup of refreshing
      type of tea such as: green tea, oolong tea, or jasmine tea.

      Pasta dishes are one of the most famous foods in Italian cuisine

      Many people regard Italy as the country with the best food in the world. Pasta
      dishes in Italian cuisine are one of the most popular and favorite types of
      food in the world. There are very few people in the world who haven’t tried
      delicious Italian foods like pizza, spaghetti, or delicious Italian ice cream.
      Many classic Italian dishes also include the regional name in their title. For
      example, spaghetti Bolognese from Bologna and Parma ham or Parmesan cheese from
      Parma.

      The mainstays of the popular Italian cuisine are pasta, rice, tomatoes, and
      cheese. Many regional variations include types of meat, seafood, or sausages
      along with delicious sauces. These can be flavored with herbs such as oregano,
      basil, or a combination of other fresh herbs.

      There is also great variation in food cultures between the various regions of
      Italy. Abruzzo cuisine from the mountainous and coastal regions has pasta, seafood,
      lamb, and wild mushrooms. Neapolitan cuisine is famous for foods like pizzas,
      spaghetti, and mozzarella. Famous Italian dishes such as lasagna, tortellini,
      and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese are from areas around Bologna and Modena.

      Greek salad is a favorite food for Greek cuisine lovers

      Greek food culture is one of the oldest in the world. Cuisine from Greece and
      the Greek islands is heavily influenced by olive oil, vegetables, fish, and
      various types of meat. In fact, a simple Greek salad may just be fresh cucumbers,
      tomatoes, red onions, a dash of olive oil, a few tasty olives, and a thick slice
      of feta cheese.

      Some popular Greek dishes include moussaka made from eggplant, tzatziki (a type
      of yogurt dip), or gyro – a type of kebab with lamb, pork, or chicken meat.
      Due to its long coastline, seafood such as squid, mussels, fish, and lobster
      are popular food choices.

      After feasting on Greek delicacies, you may have room for some common Greek
      desserts. A delicious filo pastry with layers of nuts and honey called baklava
      is one of the most favorite Greek sweet foods.

      Seafood paella is a popular dish served in many Spanish restaurants

      Similar to many countries around the Mediterranean Sea, Spanish cuisine is heavily
      influenced by seafood. A combination of mussels, cuttlefish, shrimps, and lobster
      together with paprika, saffron and rich broth create the classic seafood paella.

      Spanish food culture isn’t limited just to seafood. This popular cuisine also
      includes foods like cured meats such as Serrano or Iberico ham. Chorizo sausage,
      mushrooms, and cooked meat are used in Spanish appetizers – tapas.

      Different regions of Spain also have culinary variations. For example, La Rioja
      is famous for its red wine, cured pork, and lamb dishes. Seafood, thyme soup,
      and bean omelets are popular in Catalan cuisine. Andalusia is famous for hot
      soups, fish stews, and cold soups such as gazpacho.

      Olive oil is a staple ingredient in the Mediterranean cuisine

      It can be difficult to define what exactly Mediterranean cuisine is as there
      is great variety of dishes in it. The key ingredients of Mediterranean cuisine
      are basic foods such as olive oil, fresh vegetables, wheat (such as bread and
      pasta), and grape (such as wine).

      Mediterranean food styles include culinary delicacies from countries such as
      Morocco, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Turkey, and the Middle East.

      Mediterranean food culture is also the basis of the Mediterranean diet. This
      kind of diet contains olive oil, fresh vegetables and fruits, seafood, and nuts.

      Hummus dip with pita bread is a common type of food served in many Lebanese
      restaurants

      Lebanese food culture comprises cuisines from other Mediterranean countries.
      Poultry, seafood, lamb, or goat meat are prepared with olive oil, garlic, and
      other spices. These are usually consumed with pitta bread and fresh or grilled
      vegetables.

      Chickpeas also form a staple part of Lebanese cuisine. These are cooked and
      blended with olive oil, tahini, and lemon juice to create a delicious nutty
      hummus dip.

      As well as classic Mediterranean desserts such as baklava or halva, fresh or
      dried types of dates are also widely used in Lebanese sweet dishes.

      A vegetable couscous is served in Moroccan tagine

      Moroccan dishes are a great example of when different cuisines fuse to form
      a new type of food genre. Moroccan cuisine uses a goat, lamb, poultry, beef,
      and seafood as its basis. These meats are spiced and cooked along with lemons,
      dried fruits, and olive oil.

      One of the most famous foods in the popular Moroccan cuisine is couscous. This
      common wheat-based food is combined with various spices, herbs, and vegetables
      to create a versatile and delicious side dish. Another favorite Moroccan classic
      dish is a tagine. This is an earthenware dish used to cook meat along with vegetables
      or dried fruits.

      As with many dishes in North Africa, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean,
      Moroccan cuisine uses flatbread as a meal accompaniment.

      Lamb kebab is a popular type of dish in the Turkish cuisine

      Turkish food is another example of a fusion of various food cultures from Asia,
      Europe, and the Middle East. Eggplant, stuffed dolmas, lamb kebabs, and delicious
      vegetable stews are just some of the culinary delights you can experience with
      Turkish food. Nuts such as hazelnuts, walnuts, and chestnuts are common food
      ingredients in savory and sweet dishes.

      One important part of Turkish cuisine is yogurt. In fact, the name ‘yogurt’
      is a Turkish word. Yogurt and types of spiced yogurt are an accompaniment to
      many vegetable and meat dishes in Turkey. Cheese made from sheep’s milk is another
      important dairy product in Turkish cuisine.

      Popular beverages in Turkey include strong Turkish coffee, hot black tea, and
      Ayran – a type of yogurt drink.

      Pad Thai is a famous and delicious dish to try when visiting Thailand

      Thai cuisine is all about strong spicy flavors that incorporate sweet, sour,
      and hot elements. Some of the world’s most popular dishes are from Thailand.
      Pad Thai, green curry, and tom yum goong are just some examples of the best
      dishes from Thailand.

      Thai food is traditionally served with rice or noodles. Even spicy Thai soups
      or broths usually contain basic rice noodles.

      One of the unique features of Thai cuisine is its wide use of spices, herbs,
      and sauces. For example, fresh basil, lemongrass, kaffir lime, chilies, and
      coconut milk are some of the ingredients in Thai green curry. Also, cloves,
      ginger, cilantro, mint, and turmeric are common ingredients.

      Trying many of the different dishes in Thailand is usually a culinary experience
      that few people forget.

      Samosas may take different fillings and forms, depending on the region in India

      When it comes to spicy, aromatic dishes, Indian cuisine usually tops the list.
      The amazing range of spices, chilies, and herbs combine to make some of the
      spiciest foods you can eat.

      In India, the range of different cuisines is also impressive. Each region in
      India has its own ethnic foods and dishes. These can include vegetable pastry
      morsels such as samosas, vegetarian curries, beans with fermented fish, and
      vegetable pakoras.

      Street food is also part of the food culture in India. Tandoori chicken served
      with basic naan bread, spicy Indian snacks, and sweet dishes such as Gulab jamun
      are all popular.

      Indian cuisine has also been exported to many countries throughout the world.
      In countries like the United Kingdom, the US, Australia, and Singapore, Indian
      cuisine has been adapted to local culture.

      Crawfish dishes are very common in many restaurants in Louisiana

      Cajun food is an important part of American cuisine and is another example of
      ‘fusion cuisine.’ French cuisine combined with local ingredients in Louisiana
      has created many of the scrumptious dishes in Cajun cooking.

      Most Cajun dishes are prepared in pots. Seafood, crawfish, shrimps, vegetables,
      and steamed rice are the most common ingredients. Celery, bell peppers, citrus
      fruits, and okra are some of the fruits and vegetables common in Cajun food.

      Cajun cuisine is closely related to Creole cuisine. Gumbo is probably the signature
      dish of both cuisines.

      Taco is a traditional Mexican dish made of tortilla folded around a variety
      of fillings

      Another of the most popular types of cuisines in the world is Mexican food.
      Tacos, enchiladas, tortillas, nachos, and quesadillas are now common dishes
      in many countries around the world. Mexican food is also a popular street food
      as it’s easy to wrap delicious spicy meat, salsas, and vegetables in tortas
      or tortillas.

      Visiting an authentic Mexican restaurant provides an amazing choice of delicious
      dishes. Ethnic Mexican food can include grilled goat, meat with eggs, exotic
      fruits, and hot spicy dishes. Authentic Mexican avocado guacamole is absolutely
      delicious.

      Traditional Mexican cuisine is much different from the ‘Tex-Mex’ type of Mexican
      food that is popular in many countries.

      Jerk is a traditional cooking style in the Caribbean cuisine. In the photo:
      jerk wings with rice and broccoli

      Traditional Caribbean dishes are a combination of African, European, Cajun,
      and Middle Eastern cuisines. Fusing cooking styles from these countries along
      with local ingredients has created a unique food culture.

      Rice is the staple ingredient in most Caribbean dishes. Local ingredients such
      as coconuts, plantains, beans, tomatoes, and chickpeas are used to create tasty
      meals. The addition of fiery chilies such as Scotch bonnet peppers gives many
      Caribbean dishes a powerful kick.

      The most famous food in the Caribbean cuisine is oven-baked Jerk Chicken. This
      is a spicy dish combining chicken, habanero peppers, ginger, garlic, herbs,
      and spices.

      Although Caribbean cuisine defines many dishes from the islands, each island
      has its own food culture.

      Bratwurst is a type of German sausage most commonly made of pork

      German cuisine is famous for its sausages called Wurst in German. There are
      an estimated over 1,500 different types of German sausage. However, German food
      isn’t all about bratwurst. There are many flavorful dishes in German cuisine.

      German specialties include German fries, sauerkraut, rye bread, Spätzle (a type
      of noodle), and dumplings. Popular German desserts include donuts (without a
      hole), Black Forest cake, and Rote Grütze (a delicious berry fruit pudding).

      Of course, Germany is also well-known for its beer such as pilsner and wheat
      beer.

      Borscht is a soup common in Eastern Europe countries. Made with beetroots, it
      has a typical red color

      Russia has a wide and varied food culture due to many culinary influences from
      its different regions. Due to the harsh climate, soups and stews play an important
      role in Russian cuisine. Thick spicy meat broths, noodle soups, and cabbage
      soups are very popular. A popular type of Russian soup is borscht that contains
      beets, cabbage, beef, and eaten with sour cream.

      Grains are another important part of Russian food. For example, buckwheat, barley
      and millet are all used as accompaniments to main meals. Beef Stroganoff, meatballs,
      and a type of Shish kebab are popular meat dishes.

      Even though it has become more expensive, caviar still enjoyed by many people
      in Russia.

      Goulash is enjoyed not only in Hungary but around the world

      Similar to Russian food, Hungarian cuisine is a mixture of soups and stews.
      Maybe the most famous Hungarian dish is goulash made with meat and spicy paprika.
      This classic Hungarian meal can be served as a soup or a stew.

      Similar to many countries in Europe, Hungarian cuisine has been influenced by
      surrounding countries. Therefore, crepes, sweet dumplings, stuffed cabbage rolls,
      and sausages are all found on traditional Hungarian menus.

      Hot dog is a popular street food across USA

      American cuisine has absorbed the cultures of many who came to the United States
      in the 1800s. A fusion of cooking styles, cuisines, and ethnic foods combined
      to create a new type of cuisine. Many chefs took traditional dishes from their
      home countries and put their own twist on them.

      For example, pizza is traditional Italian food. But ‘Chicago’ pizza has a thicker
      and taller crust, whereas ‘New York Slice’ is thinner. A ‘New York Strip Steak’
      is known in other countries as sirloin or contre-filet steak.

      Hamburgers, hot dogs, ‘French fries,’ fried chicken, and deep-pan pizzas are
      new takes on traditional foods from other countries. However, they are all part
      of the list of foods belonging to American cuisine.

    - 'Stop calling yourself a ‘foodie’

      By Roberto A. Ferdman

      (Amy King/The Washington Post; iStock)

      In late 1984, The New York Times published a piece that was, at least indirectly,
      about a word we could all do without. The story covered the release of  The
      Official Foodie Handbook  by journalists Ann Barr and Paul Levy, which chronicled,
      among other things, the lives of food lovers around the world. They were food
      adventure seekers, culinary addicts who were interested in all food experiences,
      refined and not.

      A foodie,  the authors wrote,  is a person who is very, very, very interested
      in food.

      The two weren t the first to utter the term — that appears to have been Gael
      Greene, who used it in a 1980 column for New York Magazine, according to etymologist
      Barry Popik. Nor, as it happened, were they the last. But for years, the word
      was used sparingly. A populist food critic might have been described as a  foodie.  A
      gustatory pleasure seeker with the time and money to invest in obscure cooking
      methods, niche coffee roasting techniques, and not-to-be-missed meals might
      have earned the distinction too. It wasn t a compliment, it was just a descriptor.
      It was an unpretentious way to categorize a growing but still relatively small
      group of people.

      And then it wasn t.

      A look at Google Ngram, which tracks the frequency of words in digitized books,
      shows the word was nonexistent until it appeared in the early 1980s, but its
      use grew quickly shortly after the publication of Barr and Levy s book.

      A peek at Google Trends, which tracks the relative frequency with which people
      search for various things, tells a similar story. Interest in the word  foodie,  which
      seems to have piqued popular interest in late 2006, is trending at its highest
      ever. People are typing it in and pressing go.

      Of course, you don t need Google s data to know the word is everywhere. You
      have heard it, I am sure, if not today then yesterday, and if not yesterday
      then the day before. It is inescapable.

      Everyone is a  foodie

      Over time, the word has undergone an all-too-familiar transformation, bubbling
      up to a point of ubiquity that has stripped the word of any semblance of meaning.
      On a good day — or bad, depending on how you look at it — most people would
      qualify as a  foodie  to someone. The net the word casts is just too wide.

      When asked about the word in 2012, Philipino restaurateur Elbert Cuenca had
      this to say:

      It has come to the point of being bastardized. The word ‘foodie,’ which is nothing
      more than a modern-day casual substitute for ‘gourmet,’ has been relegated to
      mean anyone who likes food and/or eats out a lot. But who doesn’t like food?
      Who doesn’t eat out a lot?

      The answer, on the off chance there is any doubt, is not that many people.

      It s no wonder that the word is bemoaned by so many people who work within the
      world the term glorifies. Chefs hate it, because it empowers their customers
      to feign knowledge about things they don t actually understand. Mark Bittman
      doesn t care for it, because it too often reveres rather than challenges the
      current and flawed food system. Nor does British journalist and gourmand John
      Lanchester, who chronicled his frustration with mass  foodie -ism in a 2014
      New Yorker piece.

      This is how he explained it:

      Everyone’s a critic, they say, and that’s certainly true of the food world today.
      Of course, everyone has always been a critic, in the sense that customers have
      always made the most basic judgment of all: Do I want to come back to this joint?
      But there’s a contemporary development with respect to volume, in the dual sense
      of quantity and loudness. The volume of all this critical chatter is turned
      way up, and it’s harder than ever to ignore. Food is my favorite thing to talk
      about and to learn about, but an interest that is reasonable on a personal and
      an individual scale has grown out of all proportion in the wider culture.

      Among the list of major publications that have published something that argues,
      in so many words, that the term  foodie  is awful: The Huffington Post, The
      Daily Beast, The New York Times, and Saveur.

      The Observer, meanwhile, took its contempt a step further, coining a new term
      in 2009 to mock those who embrace its predecessor: Foodiots.

      We see it in the meticulous record-keeping of eating habits on personal blogs.
      The ubiquitous Facebook updates and tweets about subscribers’ most recent meals.
      (Surely you also have those five or so friends whose feeds are 90 percent food-consumption-related?)
      The requisite iPhone pic before a certain kind of diner—let’s call him a foodiot—ravages
      his plate.

      But it still appears everywhere

      There is no shortage of public  foodie  resentment. From people in the know,
      people whose opinions so-called  foodies  should, theoretically, value highly,
      no less. And yet, despite the heaping piles of expertly deglazed vitriol, the
      word persists.

      There are obvious (ab)users, who use the word readily and unironically, the
      sort who post really close pictures of everything they eat or watch hours of
      food television each day without ever learning how to work an oven.

      But there are others, too, who have usurped the word in arguably more upsetting
      ways.

      Just this past Monday, the National Restaurant Association published its latest
      industry forecast. In it, you ll find this doozy:  Here’s a profile of the American
      Foodie 2.0.

      Foodie  has become a marketing weapon, a buzzword which companies regurgitate
      in whatever form suits the pitch. There are dating sites for  foodies , blogs
      about Paleo  foodie -ism (an oxymoron, if I ve ever heard one), even business-help
      pieces about how companies can  better target foodies.

      I can t think of anywhere the word  foodie  appears more often in my life than
      in my email inbox, where PR pitches seem to invoke it at every opportunity.
      A recent search turned up dozens of results — hundreds more when I extended
      the search to my spam folder. One of the more recent examples (which went unanswered)
      was about a list of the  Best Cities for Food Trucks in the U.S.   Foodies today
      are considered  hip,   it read, as though it were written by someone s grandparents.

      The irony too many miss

      The problem with the word  foodie,  which many have hopefully gleaned by this
      point, boils down to a simple truth: You can’t possibly call yourself a  foodie  if
      you’re actually a  foodie.  There is a great irony in describing yourself as
      a food insider in a way no actual food insider ever would. The act itself precludes
      you from being part of the world you want to associate yourself with. The word
      doubles as a compliment and an insult, depending on who utters it.

      In this sense, using the word  foodie  is like wearing an outfit that was fashionable
      years before, long enough ago that it s no longer in style but not long enough
      ago for some to mistake it as still being cool. The analogy, of course, doesn
      t end there, because those same people wearing what was all the rage five years
      ago are also announcing that they should be thought of as members of the fashion-obsessed
      squad.

      There s nothing wrong with food populism. It s this very trend, after all, that
      has helped buoy the food movement, which is slowly reversing how disconnected
      we have all become from the production of our food. But some things have clearly
      been lost in the collective trek toward announcing whenever possible how much
      we like to eat.

      Among them, is how Levy, one the term s pioneers, first encountered the term:
      as an insult. This is how he explained it in a 2007 piece published in The Guardian:

      In late 1981 Ann Barr, then features editor of Harper s & Queen, noticed the
      food world was shifting on its tectonic plates, and that perfectly sane people
      had suddenly become obsessed with every aspect of food.

      She invited readers to write in and immediately received several attacks upon
      a greedy, single-minded and highly visible food-obsessive who wrote in the magazine
      at the time - me. Thus it was that, in the issue of August 1982, I was derided
      in the anonymous article (edited, as it happens, by me) as the ghastly, his-stomach-is-bigger-than-his-eyes,
      original, appetite-unsuppressed, lip-smacking  king foodie.  I had to sign a
      legal undertaking not to sue the magazine or myself for libel.

      It s fitting, isn t it, how we have come full circle?

    - 'Stop calling yourself a ‘foodie’

      By Roberto A. Ferdman

      (Amy King/The Washington Post; iStock)

      In late 1984, The New York Times published a piece that was, at least indirectly,
      about a word we could all do without. The story covered the release of  The
      Official Foodie Handbook  by journalists Ann Barr and Paul Levy, which chronicled,
      among other things, the lives of food lovers around the world. They were food
      adventure seekers, culinary addicts who were interested in all food experiences,
      refined and not.

      A foodie,  the authors wrote,  is a person who is very, very, very interested
      in food.

      The two weren t the first to utter the term — that appears to have been Gael
      Greene, who used it in a 1980 column for New York Magazine, according to etymologist
      Barry Popik. Nor, as it happened, were they the last. But for years, the word
      was used sparingly. A populist food critic might have been described as a  foodie.  A
      gustatory pleasure seeker with the time and money to invest in obscure cooking
      methods, niche coffee roasting techniques, and not-to-be-missed meals might
      have earned the distinction too. It wasn t a compliment, it was just a descriptor.
      It was an unpretentious way to categorize a growing but still relatively small
      group of people.

      And then it wasn t.

      A look at Google Ngram, which tracks the frequency of words in digitized books,
      shows the word was nonexistent until it appeared in the early 1980s, but its
      use grew quickly shortly after the publication of Barr and Levy s book.

      A peek at Google Trends, which tracks the relative frequency with which people
      search for various things, tells a similar story. Interest in the word  foodie,  which
      seems to have piqued popular interest in late 2006, is trending at its highest
      ever. People are typing it in and pressing go.

      Of course, you don t need Google s data to know the word is everywhere. You
      have heard it, I am sure, if not today then yesterday, and if not yesterday
      then the day before. It is inescapable.

      Everyone is a  foodie

      Over time, the word has undergone an all-too-familiar transformation, bubbling
      up to a point of ubiquity that has stripped the word of any semblance of meaning.
      On a good day — or bad, depending on how you look at it — most people would
      qualify as a  foodie  to someone. The net the word casts is just too wide.

      When asked about the word in 2012, Philipino restaurateur Elbert Cuenca had
      this to say:

      It has come to the point of being bastardized. The word ‘foodie,’ which is nothing
      more than a modern-day casual substitute for ‘gourmet,’ has been relegated to
      mean anyone who likes food and/or eats out a lot. But who doesn’t like food?
      Who doesn’t eat out a lot?

      The answer, on the off chance there is any doubt, is not that many people.

      It s no wonder that the word is bemoaned by so many people who work within the
      world the term glorifies. Chefs hate it, because it empowers their customers
      to feign knowledge about things they don t actually understand. Mark Bittman
      doesn t care for it, because it too often reveres rather than challenges the
      current and flawed food system. Nor does British journalist and gourmand John
      Lanchester, who chronicled his frustration with mass  foodie -ism in a 2014
      New Yorker piece.

      This is how he explained it:

      Everyone’s a critic, they say, and that’s certainly true of the food world today.
      Of course, everyone has always been a critic, in the sense that customers have
      always made the most basic judgment of all: Do I want to come back to this joint?
      But there’s a contemporary development with respect to volume, in the dual sense
      of quantity and loudness. The volume of all this critical chatter is turned
      way up, and it’s harder than ever to ignore. Food is my favorite thing to talk
      about and to learn about, but an interest that is reasonable on a personal and
      an individual scale has grown out of all proportion in the wider culture.

      Among the list of major publications that have published something that argues,
      in so many words, that the term  foodie  is awful: The Huffington Post, The
      Daily Beast, The New York Times, and Saveur.

      The Observer, meanwhile, took its contempt a step further, coining a new term
      in 2009 to mock those who embrace its predecessor: Foodiots.

      We see it in the meticulous record-keeping of eating habits on personal blogs.
