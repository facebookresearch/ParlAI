      \ Baskets? I don't know anything about this show. Is it something about cooking?\n\
      Yes it is. Chefs have a basket with 4 mystery ingredients. They compete to make\

      \ from around the world? \nYes, i forgot to mention there is also only a 20\
      \ or thirty minute time limit, depending on the round. The cuisine is from around\
      \ the world. Fine dining to street style. "
