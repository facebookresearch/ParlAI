      Super Bowl LV, the 55th Super Bowl and the 51st modern-era National Football
      League (NFL) championship game, will decide the league champion for the 2020
      season. The game is scheduled to be played on February 7, 2021 in Tampa, Florida
      (with the exact date pending potential changes to the NFL calendar). This will
      be the fifth Super Bowl hosted by the Tampa area, with the last one being Super
      Bowl XLIII in 2009, and the third one held at Raymond James Stadium. The game
      will be televised nationally by NBC. It will be the third time that the Super
      Bowl is in the same state in back to back years with Super Bowl LIV taking place
      at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.[1]

      1 Host-selection process

      Host-selection process[edit]

      On May 19, 2015, the league announced the five finalists that will compete to
      host Super Bowl LIII in 2019 and Super Bowl LIV in 2020. NFL owners voted on
      these cities in May 2016, with the first round of voting determining who will
      host Super Bowl LIII, the second round deciding the site for Super Bowl LIV;
      and in a development not known in advance, a third round of voting was added
      to select a Super Bowl LV hosting site during the meetings.[2] At the NFL owner
      meetings on May 24, 2016, Atlanta and Miami were awarded Super Bowls LIII and
      LIV respectively, removing them from the running. Los Angeles was not eligible
      for Super Bowl LIII, as its stadium would not yet be finished; it was eligible
      for LIV and LV, opting to bid only on the latter.

      The two candidates were as follows:

      Raymond James Stadium, Tampa, Florida: Tampa has hosted four Super Bowls, with
      the last being Super Bowl XLIII in 2009.

      Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park, Inglewood, California: Los Angeles has
      hosted the Super Bowl seven times, most recently in 1993 with Super Bowl XXVII;
      that game, along with the four prior Super Bowls in the area, were held at the
      Rose Bowl while first two Super Bowls in Los Angeles area were held at Los Angeles
      Memorial Coliseum.

      Los Angeles was originally chosen as the host site in a vote on May 24, 2016.[3][4][5]
      However, due to construction delays, authorities announced that the Los Angeles
      Stadium at Hollywood Park would not be completed until the start of the 2020
      NFL season.[6] As a result, on May 23, 2017, NFL owners voted to move Super
      Bowl LV to Tampa. The City of Inglewood will instead be hosting Super Bowl LVI
      in 2022.[7]

      NBC will broadcast Super Bowl LV , as part of an annual cycle between the three
      main broadcast television partners of the NFL.[8] As with NBC s previous Super
      Bowl (Super Bowl LII) Universo has carried Spanish-language simulcasts of select
      games, after years of aborted attempts to simulcast the games on Telemundo.

      Thomas Edward Patrick Brady Jr. (born August 3, 1977) is an American football
      quarterback for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL).
      He has won six Super Bowls, the most of any football player ever, and due to
      his numerous accomplishments, records, and accolades, many analysts and sportswriters
      consider Brady to be the greatest quarterback in NFL history.[5][6][7][8][9][10]

      After playing college football for the University of Michigan, Brady was drafted
      by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft. Due to his late selection,
      Brady is considered the biggest  steal  in the history of the NFL Draft.[11][12][13]
      In Brady s seventeen seasons as a starter,[a] he has played in nine Super Bowls
      with the Patriots, and is one of only two quarterbacks to win the Super Bowl
      in their first season as a starter (the other being Kurt Warner). Brady holds
      most of the postseason quarterback records, leading all players in postseason
      touchdowns, passing yards, and completions, while owning the corresponding Super
      Bowl records as well.

      Brady has won four Super Bowl MVP awards (Super Bowl XXXVI, XXXVIII, XLIX, and
      LI), the most ever by a player, as well as three league MVP awards (2007, 2010,
      2017); he is the oldest to have received either award.[16] Brady has also been
      selected to 14 Pro Bowls, and has led his team to more division titles (16)
      than any other quarterback in NFL history. He is fourth all-time in career passing
      yards for regular season play, third in career touchdown passes, and fourth
      in career passer rating. For regular season and postseason combined, Brady is
      first all-time in career passing yards and touchdown passes.

      The only quarterback to reach 200 regular-season wins,[17] Brady is the winningest
      quarterback in NFL history. With a postseason record of 30–10, he is first all-time
      in playoff wins and appearances for an NFL player. Brady has led the Patriots
      to an NFL-record eight consecutive AFC championship games since 2011 (thirteen
      overall), and has never had a losing season as a starting quarterback. He is
      tied for the record for the longest touchdown pass at 99 yards to Wes Welker.[18]

      For his alleged involvement in the highly publicized Deflategate football-tampering
      scandal, Brady was suspended for the first four games of the 2016 season.[19]
      Brady and the Patriots won two of the next three Super Bowls, making him the
      record holder for most Super Bowl wins by a player, and the oldest quarterback
      to win a Super Bowl, at 41.[20]

      6 Other endeavors

      Brady was born in San Mateo, California, on August 3, 1977, the only son and
      fourth child of Galynn Patricia (née Johnson) and Thomas Brady, Sr.[21] He has
      three older sisters, Nancy, Julie, and Maureen,[22] and was raised as a Catholic.
      His father is of Irish descent, while his mother has German, Norwegian, Polish,
      and Swedish ancestry.[23] Two of Brady s great-great-grandparents on his father
      s side, John and Bridget Brady, were Irish refugees from the Great Famine who
      moved to San Francisco from Boston before the American Civil War. They were
      accompanied by Bridget s sister Ann and her husband Lawrence Meegan, the parents
      of the 19th-century American Major League Baseball player  Steady  Pete Meegan.
      Brady s great-uncle Michael Buckley Jr. was the first American prisoner of war
      in World War II.[23][24][25][26][27][28]

      In the 1980s, Brady regularly attended San Francisco 49ers games at Candlestick
      Park, where he was a fan of quarterback Joe Montana; Brady has called Montana
      his idol and one of his inspirations.[29] At age four, Brady attended the 1981
      NFC Championship, against the Dallas Cowboys, in which Montana threw The Catch
      to Dwight Clark.[30] As a child, Brady attended football camp at the College
      of San Mateo, where he was taught to throw the football by camp counselor and
      future NFL/AFL quarterback Tony Graziani.[31] Brady grew up as a Los Angeles
      Lakers and Boston Celtics fan.[32]

      He attended Junípero Serra High School in San Mateo, where he graduated in 1995;
      the ceremony was held at St. Mary s Cathedral.[33] He played football, basketball,
      and baseball in high school. He played against Bellarmine College Preparatory
      rival Pat Burrell in both football and baseball. Brady began his football career
      as the backup quarterback on the Padres junior varsity team. At first, Brady
      was not good enough to start on the 0–8 JV team, which had not scored a touchdown
      all year.[34] Brady ascended to the starting position when the starting quarterback
      was injured. He became the varsity starter in his junior year and held the position
      until he graduated.[35] By Brady s senior year, he was striving to be noticed
      by college coaches. He created highlight tapes and sent them to schools he considered
      attending.[36] This led to strong interest from many football programs around
      the nation.

      The process of recruiting was much different during Brady s time, and athletes  rankings
      were not as prominent. In terms of recruiting in the 2000s, Brady would have
      been considered a four-star recruit. In essence, he was a highly rated prospect.[37]
      Brady was also on Blue Chip Illustrated as well as a Prep Football Report All-American
      selection.[38] After his recruiting process, he narrowed down his list to five
      schools.[39]  Probably the ones that we did hear from and ultimately pared the
      list to were Cal–Berkeley, UCLA, USC, Michigan, and Illinois”, his father said.[39]
      As a Cal fan, his father hoped that Brady would attend the nearby Cal, where
      Brady was a silent commit, and that he would be able to watch his son play.[40][41]

      Brady was also known as a great baseball player in high school.[42] He was a
      left-handed-batting catcher with power. His skills impressed MLB scouts, and
      he was drafted in the 18th round of the 1995 MLB Draft by the Montreal Expos.[34][43]
      The Expos projected Brady as a potential All-Star, and offered him money typical
      of that offered to a late second-round or early third-round pick.[44] Nevertheless,
      Brady was determined to play football at the next level. He was always more
      passionate about football; when he found that there was significant interest
      in him, he decided to take the road of football.[39] Brady was recruited by
      Michigan assistant Bill Harris, and he signed to play for the University of
      Michigan in 1995.[45][46] He finished his high-school football career by completing
      236 of 447 passes for 3,702 yards and 31 touchdowns. He also won All-State and
      All-Far West honors and the team s Most Valuable Player Award.[38]

      During the summers of 1998 and 1999, Brady was an intern at Merrill Lynch.[47]
      He was inducted into the Junípero Serra High School Hall of Fame in 2003, joining
      fellow Serra High graduates Barry Bonds, Lynn Swann, Gregg Jefferies, Jim Fregosi,
      and his older sister Maureen, among many others.[38] When Brady revisited two
      weeks after Super Bowl XLVI, in 2012, school administrators announced that they
      had named the football stadium Brady Family Stadium.[48]

      Brady at Michigan Stadium in 2016

      Brady played college football at the University of Michigan from 1995 to 1999.[49][50]
      He was a backup quarterback for his first two years, while teammate and future
      NFL quarterback Brian Griese led the 1997 Wolverines to an undefeated season,
      which was capped by a victory in the Rose Bowl and a share of the national championship.[51]
      When he enrolled at Michigan, Brady was seventh on the depth chart, and he had
      an intense struggle to get some playing time. At one point, Brady hired a sports
      psychologist to help him cope with frustration and anxiety, and even considered
      transferring to California.[52][53] He worked closely with assistant athletic
      director Greg Harden, who met with Brady every week to build his confidence
      and to maximize his performance on the field.[54] Brady told 60 Minutes in 2014:  He
      will always be somebody I rely on for sound advice and mentorship. He has helped
      me with my own personal struggles in both athletics and in life. Greg really
      pushed me in a direction that I wasn t sure I could go. [55]

      Under Michigan head coach Lloyd Carr, Brady battled for the starting job with
      Drew Henson[50] and ultimately started every game in the 1998 and 1999 seasons.
      During his first full year as starter, he set new Michigan records for most
      pass attempts and completions in a season, for a total of 214.[56] Brady was
      All-Big Ten honorable mention both seasons, and was the team captain in his
      senior year. The Wolverines won 20 of 25 games when he started, and he set a
      school record for completions in a 31–16 loss against Ohio State in 1998, a
      season in which Michigan shared the Big Ten Conference title.[57] Brady capped
      that season with a 45–31 win over Arkansas in the Citrus Bowl.[58]

      In the 1999 season, Brady had to once again hold off Henson for the starting
      job. The two players platooned during the season s first seven games, with Brady
      playing the first quarter, Henson the second and Carr then deciding upon a quarterback
      for the second half. The 1999 Michigan Wolverines started with a 5–0 record,
      including a 26–22 win over Notre Dame, and a road win against eventual powerhouse
      Wisconsin. Against Michigan State, Brady was not chosen to play the second half;
      however, he was reinserted into the game with Michigan down by 17 points, and
      he nearly led Michigan all the way back before losing 34–31.[59] After a 300-yard
      passing game the following week, Carr went exclusively with Brady for the remainder
      of the season. Brady went on to lead Michigan to multiple 4th-quarter comebacks,
      including a remarkable 31–27 win against Penn State, and leading them out of
      a close game against Indiana, 34–31, heading into the regular season s final
      game, winners of three straight, earning him the moniker of  Comeback Kid .[60]

      Michigan concluded the regular season against Ohio State; this was a dramatic
      game with a trip to the Orange Bowl on the line. With five minutes left, tied
      17–17, Brady led Michigan to the winning score.[61] He led Michigan to an overtime
      win in the Orange Bowl over Alabama, throwing for 369 yards, four touchdowns,
      leading the team back from a pair of 14-point deficits in regulation (14–0 in
      the first half, and 28–14 in the second). He threw the game-winning score on
      a bootleg to tight end Shawn Thompson. Michigan won the game when Alabama missed
      an extra point following its own touchdown.[62][63]

      In the two seasons that Brady started at Michigan, he posted a 20–5 record,
      including wins at the Citrus Bowl (1999) and the Orange Bowl (2000). Brady finished
      his career ranking third in Michigan history with 710 attempts and 442 completions,
      fourth with 5,351 yards and 62.3 completion percentage, and fifth with 35 touchdown
      passes.[38][64]

      A lightly regarded prospect coming out of college,[68][69] Brady was selected
      by the New England Patriots with the 199th overall pick in the sixth round of
      2000 NFL Draft and has since spent his entire 19-season career with the Patriots.
      Brady s tenure with the Patriots is an NFL record for the longest time playing
      quarterback for one franchise. Since Brady became their starting quarterback
      in 2001, the Patriots have never had a losing season and have won 16 division
      titles. The Patriots played in thirteen AFC Championship Games from 2001 to
      2018—including eight in a row from 2011 to 2018—and won nine of them. Brady
      and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick have combined to form the most successful
      quarterback-head coach tandem in NFL history, winning more regular season games
      and postseason games than any other such duo[70] as well as appearing in nine
      Super Bowls. All of these events set new NFL records.[71]

      In his second season, Brady took over as the starting quarterback after Drew
      Bledsoe was injured.[72] He led the Patriots to first place in the AFC East[73]
      and a victory over the favored St. Louis Rams[74][75] in Super Bowl XXXVI, winning
      his first Super Bowl MVP award. Despite the Patriots  missing the playoffs the
      following season, Brady would then lead them to back-to-back World Championships
      in 2003 and 2004, winning Super Bowl MVP honors again in 2003. Along the way,
      the Patriots won an NFL-record 21 consecutive games (including the playoffs)
      between the 2003 and 2004 seasons.[76] The 2005 season was Brady s first to
      throw for 4,000 yards and lead the NFL in passing.[77] That postseason, Brady
      would win his 10th consecutive playoff game, another NFL postseason record.[78]

      Although Brady and the Patriots continued to win often, they did not return
      to the Super Bowl until the 2007 season. That year, Brady not only set an NFL
      record with 50 touchdown passes[79] but he would also lead the Patriots to a
      16–0 finish,[80] the first perfect regular-season record since the Miami Dolphins
      finished 14–0 in 1972.[81][82] Brady would win his first career NFL MVP Award,
      winning 49 out of 50 votes.[83] The Associated Press also named him Male Athlete
      of the Year, the first such award given to an NFL player since Joe Montana won
      it in 1989 and 1990.[84] However, the Patriots suffered their first Super Bowl
      loss with Brady as quarterback, dropping a 17–14 decision to the New York Giants
      in Super Bowl XLII.[85]

      Brady missed virtually the entire following season due to a knee injury in the
      season opener.[86] But he would come back strong in the 2009 season to be named
      the league s Comeback Player of the Year.[87] In 2010, Brady set the NFL record
      for consecutive passes without an interception (358)[88] and broke his own record
      for the highest season touchdown-to-interception ratio (among players who have
      started a full season) at 9:1, currently the third best TD:INT ratio for a single
      season by a quarterback.[89] Brady would win his second league MVP award with
      all 50 votes in his favor.[90] He was the first unanimous NFL MVP since Giants
      linebacker Lawrence Taylor won the award in 1986.[91] He and Joe Montana are
      the only players in NFL history to win multiple NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP awards.[92][93]
      Brady was also named the top player by his peers in the first NFL Top 100 list,
      released in 2011.[94]

      In the 2011 season, Brady led the Patriots to their first AFC Championship since
      2007 and appeared in the Super Bowl for a fifth time; but the Patriots would
      lose again to the Giants.[95] Following AFC Championship Game losses in the
      following seasons (2012 and 2013), Brady and the Patriots made their sixth trip
      to the Super Bowl after the 2014 season (Brady s 15th as a professional). There,
      he led the Patriots to a fourth-quarter comeback[96] over the defending champion
      Seattle Seahawks. He would lift his fourth Super Bowl trophy (the Patriots  first
      in ten seasons) and was named Super Bowl MVP for the third time.[97]

      Despite missing the first four games of the 2016 season, Brady would lead the
      Patriots (3–1 before he rejoined them)[98] to win 11 out of the 12 remaining
      regular season games and two postseason games to make his seventh Super Bowl
      appearance. Brady and the Patriots would overcome a 25-point deficit against
      the Atlanta Falcons (down 28–3 in the third quarter) to force the first overtime
      in Super Bowl history, winning 34–28 to give Brady his fifth Super Bowl title.[99]
      He earned his fourth Super Bowl MVP award after setting title-game records for
      appearances, pass attempts, completions, passing yards and fourth-quarter comebacks.[100]
      In his eighth appearance, capping the 2017 season, Brady threw for 505 yards
      at 40 years old, setting a record for most passing yards in a Super Bowl, but
      the Patriots lost to the Philadelphia Eagles. In 2019, the Patriots won Super
      Bowl LIII, earning Brady his sixth super bowl title, becoming the first player
      in history to have won six Super Bowls.[101]

      Over his career, Brady has won three league MVP awards, six Super Bowls, and
      four Super Bowl MVP Awards. A 14-time Pro Bowler, Brady has also twice led the
      NFL in passing yardage.[102][103] As of November 2017, he owns the third-highest
      career passer rating (97.9) among quarterbacks with at least 1,500 career passing
      attempts.[104] He has thrown for more passing yards and touchdowns than any
      other quarterback in NFL postseason history; he also has won more playoff games
      than any other quarterback. As a result of his highly successful career, Brady
      is rated among the greatest quarterbacks of all time.[105]

      Brady s name has become associated with two NFL rules, which sports reporters
      have called the  Brady rules . One is the tuck rule that was in effect from
      1999 through 2013.[106] The other is a rule about low hits enacted in 2009:  A
      defender cannot initiate a roll or lunge and forcibly hit the passer in the
      knee area or below, even if he is being contacted by another player. [107]

      Brady was selected with pick number 199, a compensatory pick, in the sixth round
      of the 2000 NFL Draft.[108] He and his family had believed that Brady would
      be drafted in the second or third round; they watched the draft on television,
      stunned as six other quarterbacks were drafted before he was. Brady was so embarrassed
      that he briefly left the family home during the sixth round, and cried when
      recalling the experience for an interview 11 years later. When the Patriots
      notified him that he would be drafted, Brady was grateful that, he later said,
      he would not  have to be an insurance salesman .[109] According to Michael Holley
      s book Patriot Reign, the Patriots were considering Brady and Tim Rattay, both
      of whom had received positive reviews from then-quarterbacks coach Dick Rehbein.[110]
      Ultimately, the Patriots front office chose Brady. Considering his subsequent
      success, many analysts have called Brady the best NFL draft pick of all time.[111][112][113][114]
      Patriots owner Robert Kraft recalled: “I still have the image of Tom Brady coming
      down the old Foxboro stadium steps with that pizza box under his arm, a skinny
      beanpole, and when he introduced himself to me and said ‘Hi Mr. Kraft,’ he was
      about to say who he was, but I said ‘I know who you are, you’re Tom Brady. You’re
      our sixth round draft choice,’” recalled Kraft. “And he looked me in the eye
      and said ‘I’m the best decision this organization has ever made.’ It looks like
      he could be right.”[115]

      Brady started the season as the fourth-string quarterback, behind starter Drew
      Bledsoe and backups John Friesz and Michael Bishop; by season s end, he was
      number two on the depth chart behind Bledsoe.[116] During his rookie season,
      he was 1-for-3 passing, for six yards.[117] Tight end Rod Rutledge caught Brady
      s first and only completed pass of the season in a 34–9 loss to the Detroit
      Lions on November 23.[118][119]

      With Bledsoe as the starting quarterback, the Patriots opened the season with
      a 23–17 loss at Cincinnati.[117] In their second game and home opener on September
      23, the Patriots squared off against their AFC East rivals, the New York Jets.
      Bledsoe was again the starter; in the fourth quarter, he suffered internal bleeding
      after a hit from Jets linebacker Mo Lewis. Bledsoe returned for the next series,
      but was replaced with Brady for the Patriots  final series of the game. New
      York would hold on to win, 10–3, and the Patriots fell to 0–2 on the season.[120]
      Brady was named the starter for the season s third game, against the Indianapolis
      Colts. In his first two games as starter, Brady posted unspectacular passer
      ratings of 79.6 and 58.7, respectively, in a 44–13 victory over the Colts (in
      their last season in the AFC East) and a 30–10 loss to the Miami Dolphins.[121][122][123]

      In the Patriots  fifth game, Brady began to find his stride. Trailing the visiting
      San Diego Chargers 26–16 in the fourth quarter, he led the Patriots on two scoring
      drives to force overtime, and another in overtime to set up a winning field
      goal. Brady finished the game with 33 pass completions on 54 attempts, for 364
      yards, and two touchdowns, and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for
      the first time in his career.[124][125] The following week, Brady again played
      well during the rematch at Indianapolis, with a passer rating of 148.3 in a
      38–17 win.[126] The Patriots went on to win eleven of the fourteen games Brady
      started, and six straight to finish the regular season, winning the AFC East
      and entering the 2001–02 NFL playoffs with a first-round bye.[127] In that stretch
      was a Week 11 34–17 victory over the New Orleans Saints where he was 19 of 26
      for 258 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn his second AFC Offensive Player
      of the Week nod in 2001.[128] In Week 15, against the Miami Dolphins, he recorded
      a 23-yard reception from Kevin Faulk on a trick play.[129] Brady finished the
      2001 season with 2,843 passing yards and 18 touchdowns and earned an invitation
      to the 2002 Pro Bowl.[117][130]

      In Brady s first playoff game, he threw for 312 yards against the Oakland Raiders
      and led the Patriots back from a ten-point fourth-quarter deficit to send the
      game to overtime, where they won on an Adam Vinatieri field goal. A controversial
      play occurred in that game. Trailing by three points in the fourth quarter,
      Brady lost control of the ball after being hit by Raiders cornerback Charles
      Woodson. Oakland initially recovered the ball, but, citing the  tuck rule,  which
      states that any forward throwing motion by a quarterback begins a pass even
      if the quarterback loses possession of the ball as he is attempting to tuck
      it back toward his body, referee Walt Coleman overturned the call on instant
      replay, ruling it an incomplete pass rather than a fumble.[131] Brady finished
      the game 32-of-52 for 312 passing yards and one interception.[132]

      In the AFC Championship Game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Brady injured
      his knee, and was relieved by Bledsoe.[133] The Patriots won the game by a score
      of 24–17 and were immediately installed by Las Vegas oddsmakers as 14-point
      underdogs against the NFC champion St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI.[134][135]

      Brady returned from his knee injury in the AFC Championship Game to start in
      the Super Bowl a week later at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. Despite
      being heavy underdogs, the Patriots played well, holding the Rams  high powered
      offense in check through the first three quarters. The Rams rallied from a 17–3
      deficit to tie the game with 1:30 left in regulation. The Patriots then got
      the ball back at their own 17-yard line with no timeouts remaining. Sportscaster
      and former Super Bowl-winning coach John Madden said he thought the Patriots
      should run out the clock and try to win the game in overtime.[136] Instead,
      Brady drove the Patriots  offense down the field to the Rams  31-yard line before
      spiking the ball with seven seconds left. Then kicker Adam Vinatieri converted
      a 48-yard field goal as time expired to give the Patriots a 20–17 win and their
      first ever league championship. Brady was named MVP of Super Bowl XXXVI while
      throwing for 145 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions. At the age of 24
      years and six months, Brady surpassed Joe Namath in Super Bowl III and Joe Montana
      in Super Bowl XVI, who were both 25 years, seven months, and 13 days old at
      the time of their victories, to earn the title of youngest quarterback to win
      a Super Bowl.[137][138] A possible quarterback controversy was averted when
      Bledsoe was traded to the Buffalo Bills during the offseason; this event cemented
      Brady s status as the starting quarterback.[139]

      In the 2002 season opener, Brady had 294 passing yards and three touchdowns
      in the 30–14 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers to earn his third AFC Offensive
      of the Week title.[140][141] In Week 9, in a 38–7 victory over the Buffalo Bills,
      he had 265 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn another AFC Offensive
      Player of the Week nod.[142][143] Brady and the Patriots finished the year at
      9–7, tied with the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins for the best record in the
      division; however, the Jets won the division on the third tiebreaker, and the
      Patriots missed the playoffs.[144]

      Though Brady posted a career-low single-season passer rating of 85.7 and a career-high
      of 14 interceptions, he threw for a league-leading 28 touchdown passes and 921
      more yards than in the 2001 season.[121] However, Brady played much of the second
      half of the season with a shoulder injury, and New England head coach Bill Belichick
      later indicated that Brady would not have been able to play in their first playoff
      game if the Patriots had made the playoffs.

      After opening the 2003 NFL season with a 2–2 start, Brady led the Patriots to
      twelve consecutive victories to finish the regular season in winning the AFC
      East.[145] In Week 9, against the Denver Broncos, he had 350 passing yards,
      three touchdowns, and one interception in the 30–26 victory to earn his fifth
      AFC Offensive Player of the Week honor.[146][147] In Week 14, a 12–0 victory
      against the Miami Dolphins, he recorded a 36-yard punt in the game.[148] Statistically,
      Brady s strongest game of the season was in Week 17 against the division rival
      Buffalo Bills, when he achieved a season-high quarterback rating of 122.9, and
      was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[121][149] Brady finished with 3,620
      passing yards and 23 touchdowns,[117] and was third in NFL MVP voting to co-winners
      Peyton Manning and Steve McNair.[150]

      In the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Patriots defeated the Tennessee
      Titans in the Divisional Round by a score of 17–14. In the win, Brady was 21
      of 41 for 201 passing yards and one passing touchdown.[151] In the following
      round, they defeated Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship by a score of
      24–14. Brady completed 22 of 37 passes for 237 yards, one passing touchdown,
      and an interception.[152] On February 1, 2004, Brady led the Patriots to a 32–29
      victory over the NFC champion Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl XXXVIII and was
      named Super Bowl MVP for the second time. During the game, Brady threw for 354
      yards with three touchdowns and set the record for most completions by a quarterback
      in a Super Bowl with 32. With 1:08 left in the fourth quarter and the score
      tied 29–29, Brady engineered a drive with five pass completions to put the Patriots
      in position for the game-winning 41-yard field goal by Vinatieri.[153][154]

      Brady during Super Bowl XXXIX

      During the 2004 season, Brady helped the Patriots set an NFL record with 21
      straight wins dating from the previous year, an accomplishment honored in the
      Pro Football Hall of Fame (though for official records, the NFL considers it
      an 18-game regular season winning streak; it does not count playoff games).[155]
      New England finished with a 14–2 record, equaling their 2003 record and the
      best regular-season record ever for a defending champion.[156] The Patriots
      also won the AFC East divisional title for the third time in four years.[157]
      Brady threw for 3,692 yards and 28 touchdowns, with a 92.6 passer rating, and
      was voted to his second Pro Bowl.[117]

      In the playoffs, Brady led the Patriots to victories over the Indianapolis Colts
      in the Divisional Round by a score of 20–3 and the Pittsburgh Steelers in the
      AFC Championship by a score of 41–27.[158] Brady played his best game of the
      year in Pittsburgh despite requiring intravenous treatment the previous night
      when he ran a temperature of 103°.[159] Against the NFL s best defense,[158]
      he recorded a quarterback passer rating of 130.5, his highest of the season.[121]
      On February 6, 2005, the Patriots narrowly defeated the Philadelphia Eagles,
      24–21, to win Super Bowl XXXIX at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida. Brady
      threw for 236 yards and two touchdowns[160] while capturing the Patriots  third
      championship in four years. They became the first franchise since the Dallas
      Cowboys in 1992–1995 to win three Super Bowls in four years.[161]

      During the 2005 season, injuries suffered by running backs Corey Dillon, Patrick
      Pass, and Kevin Faulk forced the Patriots to rely more on Brady s passing.[162][163]
      Brady also had to adjust to new center Russ Hochstein and running back Heath
      Evans. On October 9, in a 31–28 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, he had 350
      passing yards, three touchdowns, and one interception to earn AFC Offensive
      Player of the Week honors.[164][165] Brady finished first in the league with
      4,110 passing yards and third in the league with 26 touchdowns.[117] At 92.3,
      his 2005 passer rating was the second-highest of his career at the time, although
      he equaled his career high for interceptions with 14.[121] He rushed for 89
      yards and fumbled a career-low four times.[121] He and the Patriots finished
      with a 10–6 record, winning their third straight AFC East title.[166] He was
      named to his third Pro Bowl at the end of the season.[167]

      In the playoffs, Brady recorded 201 passing yards and three passing touchdowns
      to help lead the Patriots to a 28–3 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars in
      the Wild Card Round. On January 14, 2006, the Patriots lost 27–13 to the Denver
      Broncos at INVESCO Field in the Divisional Round.[168][169] Brady threw for
      341 yards in the game with one touchdown and two interceptions, in the first
      playoff loss of his career after ten playoff victories.[170] After the season
      s end, it was revealed that Brady had been playing with a sports hernia since
      December. Linebacker Willie McGinest commented on it and said he knew, but Brady
      continued playing.[171]

      Brady on the sideline at Giants Stadium with teammates Randy Moss and Jabar
      Gaffney, after throwing for his record-breaking 50th passing touchdown of the
      2007 season

      Brady started the 2006 season with 163 passing yards, two passing touchdowns,
      and an interception against the Buffalo Bills in a 19–17 victory.[172] In Week
      8, against the Minnesota Vikings, he had one of his stronger performances of
      the season with 372 passing yards, four passing yards, and one interception
      in the 31–7 victory.[173] He posted another game with four passing touchdowns
      in the Week 11 35–0 victory over the Green Bay Packers.[174] Brady led the Patriots
      to a 12–4 record and the fourth seed in the AFC playoffs.[175] In the regular
      season, Brady threw for 3,529 yards and 24 touchdowns.[117] He was not among
      the players initially selected to the Pro Bowl,[176] although he was offered
      an injury-replacement selection when San Diego Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers
      was forced to withdraw. Brady ended up declining the invitation.[177]

      In the postseason, the Patriots first hosted their division rivals, the New
      York Jets, in the Wild Card Round. The Patriots defeated the Jets 37–16, as
      Brady went 22–34 for 212 yards and two touchdowns.[178] The Patriots traveled
      to San Diego to take on the Chargers in the Divisional Round. This was Brady
      s first playoff game in his home state of California. Brady and the Patriots
      struggled against the Chargers, whom many had picked as favorites to win Super
      Bowl XLI.[179] With eight minutes left in the fourth quarter and the Patriots
      down by eight points, Brady and the Patriots started a key drive that would
      ultimately decide the game. After a 49-yard pass play to wide receiver Reche
      Caldwell, a Stephen Gostkowski field goal gave the Patriots a 24–21 win.[180]

      In the AFC Championship, the Patriots faced the Indianapolis Colts. The Patriots
      and Colts had faced each other twice in the previous three postseasons at Foxborough;
      this game, however, was played at Indianapolis. The Patriots led at halftime,
      21–6; however, the Colts and Peyton Manning staged a comeback, culminating in
      a last minute interception thrown by Brady, and the Patriots lost the game to
      the Colts, 34–38.[181]

      Playing with a dramatically overhauled receiver corps—in the 2007 offseason,
      the Patriots acquired wide receivers Donté Stallworth, Wes Welker, Kelley Washington,
      and Randy Moss; tight end Kyle Brady; and running back Sammy Morris—Brady enjoyed
      what some sportswriters described as one of the best seasons by a quarterback.[182][183]
      The average score of a 2007 Patriots regular-season game would be 37–17 by the
      end of the year.[184] Brady led the Patriots to the first 16–0 regular-season
      record in league history, outscoring opponents by more than a 2-to-1 margin,
      but also attained numerous career, franchise, and NFL records and milestones
      in the process. He was named as the AFC Offensive Player of the Week five separate
      times that year.[185][186][187][188][189] While away at Dallas, he had a career-high
      five passing touchdowns in a 48–27 win. The win tied him with Cowboys Hall of
      Fame quarterback Roger Staubach for the most wins ever by a starting quarterback
      in his first 100 regular-season games, with 76.[190] The next week, in part
      of a 49–28 win at Miami, he had yet another record day, with a career-high six
      passing touchdowns, setting a franchise record. He also had the first game with
      a perfect passer rating of his career.[191] Two weeks later, as part of a come-from-behind
      24–20 victory at Indianapolis, he threw for another three touchdowns, the ninth
      consecutive game in which he had done so, breaking Peyton Manning s NFL record
      of eight.[192] During the last game of the year, Brady threw two touchdown passes;
      his second touchdown was his 50th, breaking Peyton Manning s record of 49 in
      the 2004 season.[193]

      Brady in December 2007

      Brady finished the season with 4,806 passing yards, 50 touchdown passes, and
      only eight interceptions. It was unanimously voted the greatest passing season
      of all time by ESPN in 2013. His 50:8 touchdown to interception ratio was, at
      the time, an NFL record. He became the first quarterback to pass for 50 touchdowns
      in a season and his 117.2 passer rating is[when?] the fourth highest in a single
      season. His 8.7% touchdown passing percentage is[when?] the third highest ever
      in a season. He led the Patriots to becoming the first team to ever go undefeated
      in the regular season since the 16 game schedule was enforced and directed an
      offense that scored a then NFL record 589 points and 75 total touchdowns. Those
      records stood until they were eclipsed by the 2013 Denver Broncos. The team
      s 50 total touchdown passes is the fourth most ever in a season. For his efforts,
      Brady was named the Most Valuable Player of this season, as well as Offensive
      Player of the Year. He was also honored by the Associated Press as their Male
      Athlete of the Year, the first time an NFL player has been so honored since
      Joe Montana won the award in 1990.[194] He was named as a First Team All-Pro
      and to his fourth career Pro Bowl as a result of his historic season.[195][196]

      In the Patriots  first playoff game, a Divisional Round game against Jacksonville,
      Brady began the game with an NFL postseason record 16 consecutive completed
      passes, and finished the game with 26 completions in 28 attempts, a completion
      rate of 92.9%. That mark is the highest single-game completion percentage (for
      passers with at least 20 attempts) in NFL history, regular season or postseason.[197]
      With the win, the Patriots matched the undefeated 1972 Miami Dolphins as the
      only team to win 17 consecutive games in one season.

      Statistically, Brady did not fare as well in the AFC Championship Game against
      the San Diego Chargers, throwing three interceptions (including his first interception
      in the red zone since the playoff loss to Denver in the 2005 postseason). Nevertheless,
      the Patriots won their 18th game of the season, 21–12, to advance to the Super
      Bowl for the fourth time in seven seasons. Brady, with the 100th win of his
      career, also set an NFL record for the fewest games needed by a starting quarterback
      to do so: his 100–26 record is sixteen games better than Joe Montana s.[198]
      In Super Bowl XLII at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.,
      Brady was pressured heavily and sacked five times. The Patriots did manage to
      take the lead with a Brady touchdown to Moss with less than three minutes remaining
      in the fourth quarter, but the Giants were able to score a last-minute touchdown
      to upset the Patriots 17–14, taking away what would have been the first perfect
      season since the NFL expanded its regular season to 16 games.[199]

      Brady in action against the Washington Redskins on August 28, 2009.

      Brady did not play in any games during the 2008 preseason or in the 2008 Pro
      Bowl due to two different foot injuries.[200][201] In the Patriots  2008 season
      opener against the Kansas City Chiefs at Gillette Stadium, Brady s left knee
      was seriously injured midway through the first quarter on a hit by Chiefs safety
      Bernard Pollard; he left the game and did not return. The team later confirmed
      that Brady would require surgery, and it would prematurely end his 2008 season.[202]
      Brady tore both his anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament.[203]
      The injury ended Brady s streak of 111 consecutive starts (ninth in the list
      of most consecutive starts by an NFL quarterback, behind Brett Favre, Peyton
      Manning, Eli Manning, Philip Rivers, Matt Ryan, Matthew Stafford, Ron Jaworski,
      and Joe Flacco).[204] Dr. Neal ElAttrache performed the anterior cruciate ligament
      reconstruction at the Los Angeles Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic October 6,
      using Brady s patellar tendon graft to replace the torn ligament, and also repaired
      his medial collateral ligament, through a separate incision in his left knee.[205]
      An infection in the wound resulted in further debridement surgery several times
      since the original procedure. Brady received IV antibiotics for this infection
      which, at the time, threatened to delay his rehab.[206][207] Despite Brady s
      absence, the Patriots managed to finish the 2008 season with an 11–5 record;
      however, due to tiebreakers, the Patriots not only failed to win the AFC East
      division title, but missed the playoffs altogether for the first time since
      the 2002 season.[208]

      Brady in Landover, Maryland, on August 28, 2009, during warmups in a preseason
      game against the Washington Redskins.

      In his first game in nearly a year, Brady threw for 378 yards and two touchdowns
      in the 2009 season opener against the Buffalo Bills. In the final three minutes
      of the game, the Patriots were down 24–13 before Brady and tight end Benjamin
      Watson connected on two straight touchdowns to lead the Patriots to a 25–24
      win.[209] Brady was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the 13th
      time in his career for his performance.[210]

      On October 18, 2009, in an early season snowstorm, Brady set an NFL record against
      the Tennessee Titans for most touchdowns in a single quarter, throwing five
      in the second quarter. Brady finished the game with six touchdowns, tying his
      career-high from the 2007 season, and 380 yards, completing 29-of-34 attempts,
      finishing with a nearly perfect passer rating of 152.8.[211][212] He earned
      his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week nod for his efforts against the
      Titans.[213] The Patriots  59–0 victory over the Titans tied the record for
      the largest margin of victory since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger,[214] and set a
      record for largest halftime lead in NFL history, which was 45–0.[215]

      Brady finished the 2009 regular season with 4,398 yards passing and 28 touchdowns
      for a 96.2 rating,[117] despite a broken right ring finger and three fractured
      ribs, all which were suffered over the course of the season.[216] He was selected
      as a reserve to the 2010 Pro Bowl and named the 2009 NFL Comeback Player of
      the Year.[217][218]

      Brady ended the 2009 season throwing for 154 passing yards, two touchdowns,
      and three interceptions in a Wild Card Round loss to the Baltimore Ravens, 33–14,
      his first career home playoff loss, and the first playoff loss at home by a
      Patriots quarterback since 1978 (Steve Grogan).[219]

      On September 10, 2010, Brady signed a four-year, $72 million contract extension,
      making him the highest-paid player in the NFL. The extension included $48.5
      million in guaranteed money.[220]

      Brady became the quickest quarterback to achieve 100 regular season wins by
      helping his team defeat the Miami Dolphins 41–14 on October 4, 2010.[221]

      In a 31–28 win over the Indianapolis Colts on November 21, 2010, Brady tied
      Brett Favre s record of winning 25 consecutive regular-season home starts.[222]
      Brady s last regular-season defeat at home was a 17–14 loss to the New York
      Jets on November 12, 2006.[223] On November 25, in a 45–24 victory over the
      Detroit Lions, he had 341 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn AFC Offensive
      Player of the Week.[224][225] In the game, he earned a perfect passer rating
      for the second time in his career.[226][227] The next week, in a 45–3 victory
      over the New York Jets, he had 326 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn
      AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for the second consecutive week. The
      victory over the Jets set an NFL record by winning 26 consecutive regular-season
      home starts.[228][229][230]

      Brady threw for 3,900 yards with 36 touchdowns and only four interceptions on
      the season.[117] He had a 111.0 passer rating; this gave him—at the time—two
      of the top five season ratings in NFL history and made him the first player
      to finish with a rating above 110 in two different seasons.[231]

      Brady was selected as a starter to the 2011 Pro Bowl.[232] However, he pulled
      out of the game (and was replaced by former backup Matt Cassel of the Kansas
      City Chiefs) after undergoing surgery for a stress fracture in his right foot
      dating back to 2008.[233] Brady was also the only unanimous selection for the
      AP All-Pro Team and was named the 2010 Associated Press NFL Offensive Player
      of the Year. By unanimous decision, he won the MVP award for the second time
      in his career.[234] On the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011 players  list, Brady
      was ranked as the best player in the NFL by his fellow players.[235]

      After earning the #1 seed and a bye week, the Patriots lost to the New York
      Jets in the Divisional Round by a score of 28–21. Brady finished the game 29-of-45
      for 299 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception. His one interception
      ended his NFL record of consecutive passes without an interception at 340.[236][237]

      In Week 1 of the 2011 NFL season, Brady threw for a career-high 517 yards, four
      touchdowns, and one interception in a 38–24 victory over the Miami Dolphins
      and earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.[238] This was the second
      time that he had thrown for 400 or more yards in a single game. In the game,
      he threw a record-tying 99-yard touchdown pass to Wes Welker in the second quarter.[239][240][18]
      In the next game, a 35–21 victory over the San Diego Chargers, he had 423 passing
      yards and three touchdowns to earn another AFC Offensive Player of the Week
      nod.[241][242]

      In Week 16, in the second divisional game against the Miami Dolphins, Brady
      had 304 passing yards and one passing touchdown to go along with nine rushes
      for 17 yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 27–24 victory to earn AFC Offensive
      Player of the Week for the third time in 2011.[243][244] In the regular season
      finale against the Buffalo Bills, Brady became the fourth quarterback to throw
      for 5,000 yards in a single season, finishing with 5,235; although Brady surpassed
      Dan Marino s longstanding record of 5,084 passing yards, he finished the season
      second in passing yards behind Drew Brees s 5,476.[117] In the end, the Patriots
      finished the season 13–3 and clinched the AFC s #1 seed.[245] For his efforts
      in the 2011 season, Brady was named to the Pro Bowl and was named as the fourth
      best player in the NFL on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012 by his peers.[246][247]

      There s no quarterback I d rather have than Tom Brady. He s the best. He does
      so much for us in so many ways on so many different levels. I m very fortunate
      that he s our quarterback and what he s able to do for this team. It s good
      to win with him and all the rest of our players. If that s more than somebody
      else did, I don t really care about that.[248]

      –Bill Belichick

      In the Patriots  45–10 rout of the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round, Brady
      set a personal postseason best with 363 passing yards, and tied an NFL playoff
      record shared by Daryle Lamonica and Steve Young, throwing for six touchdown
      passes.[249] The win, his first postseason win since January 2008, gave Brady
      and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick sole possession of the NFL record for
      postseason wins by a quarterback-head coach combo with 15.[250] In the AFC Championship
      game against the Baltimore Ravens, Brady failed to throw a touchdown pass for
      the first time in 36 games, though he did pass for 239 yards and scored a one-yard
      rushing touchdown late in the game. A missed field goal from Ravens kicker Billy
      Cundiff gave Brady and the Patriots a 23–20 victory, sending Brady to his fifth
      Super Bowl as a member of the Patriots.[251] In Super Bowl XLVI at Lucas Oil
      Stadium in Indianapolis, Brady and the Patriots met the New York Giants in a
      rematch of their Super Bowl XLII meeting four years earlier. Brady played well,
      leading a Super Bowl record-tying 96-yard touchdown drive to close the first
      half and at one point completing 16 passes in a row to give him a 20-of-23 mark
      partway into the third quarter, another Super Bowl record. Brady threw two touchdowns
      against one interception on the Patriots  first offensive series, and was penalized
      for intentional grounding in the end zone, giving up a crucial safety to the
      Giants. A final score of 21–17 for the Giants prevented Brady from winning his
      fourth Super Bowl.[252]

      Brady started all 16 regular season games of the 2012 NFL season and led the
      Patriots to a 12–4 record. Among the many highlights of the team was a 42–14
      win over the Houston Texans in Week 14. Brady had 296 passing yards and four
      touchdowns to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[253][254] The Patriots
      scored 557 total points, the third highest in league history and Brady became
      the first quarterback to lead his team to ten division titles.[255] With that
      point total, the Patriots became the first team to score at least 500 points
      in a season four different times, with Brady leading all four squads, which
      was a record as well. He finished the season with 4,827 passing yards, 34 touchdowns,
      only eight interceptions, and a passer rating of 98.7. It was Brady s third
      straight season throwing for over 30 touchdowns.[256] He was named to the Pro
      Bowl for the eighth time in his career.[257] On the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013,
      Brady was ranked fourth by his fellow players for the second consecutive year.[258]

      Brady started both Patriots playoff games, winning 41–28 against the Houston
      Texans in the Divisional Round.[259] Brady passed for 344 yards and three touchdowns
      as he led the team to their seventh AFC Championship Game in his 12 years as
      a starter. With the victory, Brady surpassed Joe Montana for most career playoff
      wins, with 17.[260] The Patriots were then upset by the eventual Super Bowl
      XLVII champion Baltimore Ravens, 28–13 in the AFC Championship. He threw for
      320 yards and one touchdown with two interceptions.[261] He suffered his first
      career loss at home when leading by halftime, in which during that span he was
      67–0.[262]

      On February 25, 2013, Brady and the Patriots agreed on a three-year contract
      extension, which kept him with the team through 2017.[263] Peter King called
      it an  amazing  deal, as Brady took just $27 million in new money over the 2015,
      2016, and 2017 seasons, and also noted that it reflected Patriots owner Robert
      Kraft s desire to make sure that Brady retired as a Patriot.[264]

      Brady and the Patriots began the season with much upheaval on the offensive
      side of the ball. Tight end Rob Gronkowski was injured and Aaron Hernandez was
      arrested. Wes Welker departed to the Denver Broncos, Danny Woodhead left in
      free agency for the San Diego Chargers, and Brandon Lloyd was released from
      the team. In order to replace the five players, the Patriots signed Danny Amendola
      in free agency from the Rams, drafted rookie wide receivers Aaron Dobson and
      Josh Boyce, and signed undrafted rookie free agent wide receiver Kenbrell Thompkins.
      In the first two games of the season, Brady completed 52% of his passes and
      had three touchdowns and one interception.[265][266]

      Brady during the 2013 season

      Brady was in pursuit of Drew Brees s record of at least one touchdown in 54
      consecutive regular season games and saw the streak end at 52 games in a Week
      5 loss against the Cincinnati Bengals.[267] In a Week 6 game against the Saints,
      the Patriots struggled in the first half and bounced back in the second with
      Brady passing for 269 yards with a touchdown to Kenbrell Thompkins as time expired
      to pull out the win over the Saints.[268]

      In Week 12, Brady faced-off against Peyton Manning for the fourteenth time in
      his career. After going to the half trailing by 24 points, Brady and the Patriots
      scored 31 unanswered points. The Patriots won after a muffed punt in overtime
      when Stephen Gostkowski scored a field goal.[269] With the win, Brady earned
      AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.[270] With a Week 16 win over the Baltimore
      Ravens, Brady collected his 147th win as a starting quarterback to tie Dan Marino
      for fourth place all time, and the following week he defeated the Buffalo Bills
      to tie John Elway for third place. In the victory over the Bills, Brady recorded
      a 32-yard punt.[271] Brady was named to the Pro Bowl for the ninth time in career
      and was ranked third on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014 players  list in the
      offseason.[272][273]

      Brady s Patriots finished the season 12–4, to earn the second seed in the AFC
      and a first-round bye.[274] In the Divisional Round matchup against the Indianapolis
      Colts, Brady made his 25th playoff appearance, breaking Brett Favre s career
      record for playoff appearances by a quarterback (Jerry Rice appeared in 29 playoff
      games). He passed for 198 yards as the Patriots won 43–22 behind a four-touchdown
      performance from LeGarrette Blount.[275] The following week, the Patriots lost
      26–16 to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship, eliminating Brady and the
      Patriots from the playoffs. In the loss, Brady was 24-for-38 for 277 yards and
      touchdown, along with two carries for seven yards and a rushing touchdown.[276]

      Brady in September 2014 against the Minnesota Vikings

      Brady started the 2014 season with a 33–20 loss to the Miami Dolphins.[277]
      It was Brady s first opening day loss since the 2003 season. Brady recorded
      241 yards and a touchdown in the loss. New England rebounded against the Minnesota
      Vikings, but Brady struggled, throwing for 149 yards and a touchdown in a 30–7
      win.[278] Against the Oakland Raiders, Brady was pressured all day, but threw
      for 234 yards and a touchdown in 16–9 win.[279] After a humiliating 41–14 loss
      to the Kansas City Chiefs, Brady led New England to back-to-back wins against
      the Cincinnati Bengals and the Buffalo Bills.[280][281] Brady then defeated
      the New York Jets with a 261-yard performance that included three touchdowns.[282]
      The following week, a 51–23 embarrassment of the Chicago Bears saw Brady throw
      for 354 yards and a season-high five touchdowns.[283] After passing for 333
      yards, and 257 yards in his next two games against the Denver Broncos and Indianapolis
      Colts respectively, Brady defeated the Detroit Lions 34–9 with 349 passing yards
      and two touchdowns against only one interception.[284] The Patriots winning
      streak was put to the test against the Green Bay Packers in Week 13. Down 13–0
      early, Brady threw for 245 yards and two touchdowns. Still down 26–21, Brady
      was unable to give the Patriots their eighth consecutive victory.[285] After
      trailing 14–3 at the San Diego Chargers, Brady rallied his team with 317 passing
      yards, two touchdowns, and one interception, to a 23–14 comeback win.[286] Brady
      clinched his NFL record 12th AFC East division title with 287 passing yards,
      two touchdowns, and an interception. Brady struggled in his final two games,
      throwing for only 182 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in 17–16 victory
      against the Jets, and 80 yards in one half of the final regular season game
      against the Buffalo Bills, a 17–9 loss, though Julian Edelman, Rob Gronkowski,
      and three starting offensive linemen did not play either the entirety or the
      majority of the final game, and Brady only played in the first half.[287] Brady
      was named to his tenth career Pro Bowl and was ranked third by his fellow players
      on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015.[288][289]

      In a 35–31 Divisional Round win over the Ravens, Brady threw for three touchdowns
      and ran in a fourth, breaking Curtis Martin s club record for rushing touchdowns
      in the playoffs; Brady also broke Joe Montana s record for playoff touchdowns
      with 46. After the Ravens scored on their first two possessions, the Patriots
      were quickly down 14–0. Brady led New England on an eight-play, 78-yard drive,
      and ran for a score to cut the Ravens lead to 14–7. In the second quarter, Brady
      s 15 yard touchdown pass to Danny Amendola tied the score at 14–14. After getting
      the ball back, Brady threw an interception at the end of the first half. Joe
      Flacco capitalized on it by throwing an 11-yard touchdown strike to tight end
      Owen Daniels to give Baltimore a 21–14 halftime lead. Down 28–14, Brady engineered
      an 80-yard drive, culminating in a touchdown to Rob Gronkowski to cut the lead
      to 28–21. The Patriots tied the game once again at 28 off of a trick play where
      Brady passed laterally to Julian Edelman who then threw a 51-yard touchdown
      to Danny Amendola. Ravens kicker Justin Tucker drilled a 25-yard field goal
      to give Baltimore a 31–28 4th quarter lead. Brady got the ball back, and threw
      a 23-yard touchdown to wide receiver Brandon LaFell to give the Patriots their
      first lead, up 35–31. After a Duron Harmon interception and a Joe Flacco Hail
      Mary attempt failed, Brady clinched his record ninth AFC Championship Game,
      fourth straight, and the third championship game against the Indianapolis Colts.[290]
      After a 45–7 blowout, Brady advanced to play in his sixth Super Bowl, breaking
      a tie with John Elway for most career Super Bowl appearances by a quarterback.
      Against the Colts, Brady threw for 226 yards and three passing touchdowns with
      one interception[291]

      In Super Bowl XLIX at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, Brady
      completed 37-of-50 passes for 328 yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions.
      He guided a then-record ten-point fourth quarter comeback as the Patriots defeated
      the Seattle Seahawks 28–24 to give Brady his fourth Super Bowl ring, tying him
      with Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw for most Super Bowl victories by a starting
      quarterback.[292] He was named Super Bowl MVP for the third time, tying Montana
      s record. Brady s 37 completed passes in the game set a Super Bowl record at
      the time, which Brady himself would break in Super Bowl LI two years later.[293]

      Further information: Deflategate

      On May 6, 2015, the NFL published a 243-page report regarding the deflation
      of footballs used in the previous season s AFC Championship Game.[294] The report
      concluded that, more likely than not, Brady was at least generally aware of
      the intentional deflation. On May 11, Brady was suspended for four games by
      the NFL for his involvement based on  substantial and credible evidence  that
      Brady knew Patriots employees were deflating footballs and that he failed to
      cooperate with the investigators.[295] On May 11, Troy Vincent—NFL Executive
      Vice President of Football Operations—penned a letter to Brady that stated in
      part:  Your actions as set forth in the report clearly constitute conduct detrimental
      to the integrity of and public confidence in the game of professional football.
      [296] Vincent s letter further stated:  With respect to your particular involvement,
      the report established that there is substantial and credible evidence to conclude
      you were at least generally aware of the actions of the Patriots  employees
      involved in the deflation of the footballs and that it was unlikely that their
      actions were done without your knowledge. Moreover, the report documents your
      failure to cooperate fully and candidly with the investigation, including by
      refusing to produce any relevant electronic evidence (emails, texts, etc.),
      despite being offered extraordinary safeguards by the investigators to protect
      unrelated personal information, and by providing testimony that the report concludes
      was not plausible and contradicted by other evidence. [296] Brady, through the
      NFL Players Association, officially appealed the suspension on May 14.[297]

      On July 28, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced the upholding of Brady
      s four-game suspension.[298] Brady gave permission to the NFLPA to appeal the
      suspension in federal court.[299] Goodell cited Brady s destruction of his cell
      phone as a critical factor in his decision to uphold Brady s suspension.[300][301]
      The NFL also filed papers in federal court seeking to confirm Roger Goodell
      s decision.[302] On July 29 Brady released a statement on his Facebook page
      that criticized Goodell s decision to uphold the suspension, saying in part  I
      am very disappointed by the NFL s decision to uphold the 4 game suspension against
      me. I did nothing wrong, and no one in the Patriots organization did either...
      I will not allow my unfair discipline to become a precedent for other NFL players
      without a fight. [303][304]

      Commentary on the initial punishment was mixed. Bleacher Report writer Mike
      Freeman made a statement agreeing with Goodell s decision, saying the penalties
      were  brutal, but it deserved to be. [305] Various commentators also implied
      that the prior reputation of the Patriots organization as a team that bends
      rules appeared to factor into the harshness of the punishment.[305][306] Others
      described the punishment as  firm but fair .[307]

      On September 3, 2015, Judge Richard M. Berman of the United States District
      Court for the Southern District of New York vacated Brady s suspension; this
      ruling allowed Brady to play in the first four games of the 2015 NFL season.
      In his decision, Judge Berman cited the NFL s failure to provide proper notice
      to Brady of the charges against him and the potential for a suspension.[308]
      Post-appeal commentary also criticized Goodell for  manipulating Brady s testimony  at
      the appeal hearing in his decision.[309]

      In the NFL Kickoff Game, Brady led the Patriots to a 28–21 win over the Pittsburgh
      Steelers. He threw for 288 yards and four touchdowns, three of them to Rob Gronkowski.[310]
      The Patriots  victory was the 161st victory of Brady s career, all with the
      Patriots, which surpassed the record held by former Green Bay Packers quarterback
      Brett Favre for most regular season wins by a starting quarterback with a single
      team. In Week 2, Brady threw for 466 yards and three touchdowns against the
      Buffalo Bills. Through the first five games of the season, Brady threw a total
      of 14 touchdowns with one interception and had a quarterback rating of 118.4.[311]
      In Week 8, a 36–7 victory over the Miami Dolphins, he had 356 passing yards
      and four touchdowns to earn his 25th AFC Offensive Player of the Week title.[312][313]

      Despite Brady s success, the Patriots were hit by many injuries to key players
      on offense, including wide receiver Julian Edelman, and the Patriots eventually
      lost their first game against the Denver Broncos, who were without Peyton Manning,
      in Denver on the Sunday after Thanksgiving following a 10–0 start.[314] The
      Patriots then lost three of their remaining five games to finish 12–4 for a
      fourth straight season, tied with the Cincinnati Bengals and Denver Broncos
      for the AFC s best record. The Denver Broncos clinched the No. 1 seed due to
      their victories over both the Patriots and the Bengals, while the Patriots finished
      with the AFC s No. 2 seed due to having a better record against common opponents
      than the Cincinnati Bengals.[315][316] Brady finished the regular season with
      a league-leading 36 touchdown passes and seven interceptions.[317] He was named
      to his 11th Pro Bowl (seventh straight), and was ranked as the second best player
      on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016 behind only league MVP Cam Newton.[318][319]

      With the return of Julian Edelman from a foot injury, the Patriots defeated
      the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round by a score of 27–20 after advancing
      with a first round bye.[320] Brady completed 28 of 42 passes for 302 yards and
      two passing touchdowns and one rushing touchdown as he led the team to their
      fifth consecutive AFC championship game.[321] The Patriots advanced to the AFC
      Championship to face Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos at Sports Authority
      Field at Mile High. It would turn out to be the 17th and final meeting between
      the two storied quarterbacks, as Manning would announce his retirement after
      the season ended. The Broncos  top-ranked defense harassed Brady, who completed
      27-of-56 passes with two interceptions and a touchdown, all day, and the Patriots
      eventually lost the game 20–18 after a potential game-tying two-point conversion
      attempt failed with 17 seconds left in regulation.[322]

      On February 29, 2016, Brady signed a two-year contract extension covering the
      2018 and 2019 seasons.[323]

      Three days later, the NFL appealed Judge Richard M. Berman s 2015 decision to
      vacate Brady s four-game suspension as punishment for his alleged role in the
      Deflategate scandal. At the March 3, 2016, hearing in New York City, the three-judge
      panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit questioned
      Players Association lawyer Jeffrey L. Kessler more intensely than NFL lawyer
      Paul Clement, with Circuit Judge Denny Chin even stating that  the evidence
      of ball tampering is compelling, if not overwhelming. [324]

      On April 25, 2016, Judge Richard M. Berman s decision to block Brady s four-game
      suspension was overturned by the U.S. Appeals Court.[325][326] Circuit Judge
      Barrington Daniels Parker Jr., joined by Circuit Judge Chin, wrote that they
      could not  second-guess  the arbitration but were merely determining it  met
      the minimum legal standards established by the Labor Management Relations Act
      of 1947 .[327] Circuit Chief Judge Robert Katzmann dissented, writing that the
      NFL s fines for using stickum was  highly analogous  and that here  the Commissioner
      was doling out his own brand of industrial justice. [328]

      On May 23, 2016, Brady appealed for his case to be reheard by the full U.S.
      2nd Circuit Court.[329] The 2nd Circuit Court denied Brady s request for an
      en banc hearing on July 13.[330] Two days later, on Friday, July 15, 2016, Brady
      announced on his Facebook page that he would give up his Deflategate fight and
      accept his suspension for the first four regular season games of the 2016 season.
      Prior to Brady s suspension, he had not missed a single regular season or postseason
      game since the start of the 2009 season.

      After serving his four-game suspension, Brady made his 2016 season debut on
      October 9 on the road against the Cleveland Browns; he completed 28-of-40 passes
      for 406 yards and three touchdowns in a 33–13 victory to earn AFC Offensive
      Player of the Week.[331][332] In his home debut the following week, Brady completed
      29-of-35 passes for 376 yards and three touchdowns in a 35–17 victory over the
      Cincinnati Bengals.[333] In Week 7, Brady completed 19 of 26 passes for 222
      yards and two touchdowns as New England defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27–16.[334]
      The next week, the Patriots defeated the Buffalo Bills 41–25, with Brady completing
      22-of-33 passes for 315 yards and four touchdowns.[335] Brady s outstanding
      numbers during his first four games following the suspension earned him the
      AFC Offensive Player of the Month award for October.[336]

      Following a bye week, Brady and the Patriots faced the Seattle Seahawks in a
      Week 10 rematch of Super Bowl XLIX. Brady completed 23-of-32 passes for 316
      yards, one interception, and no touchdowns in a 31–24 loss that saw the two
      teams trade leads seven times.[337] In Week 11, Brady completed 24-of-40 passes
      for 280 yards, four touchdowns, and no interceptions in a 30–17 road win against
      his childhood team, the San Francisco 49ers. Brady s performance against San
      Francisco earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for Week 11.[338]
      Those four touchdown passes also gave him 444 career regular season touchdown
      passes with one team, breaking Brett Favre s record. The following week, Brady
      completed 30-of-50 passes for 286 yards and two touchdowns in a 22–17 road victory
      against the New York Jets.[339] The win was also the Patriots  500th victory
      (including playoffs) in franchise history. During this victory, Brady also became
      the fifth quarterback to record 60,000 career regular season passing yards,
      joining Peyton Manning, Brett Favre, Drew Brees, and Dan Marino. The following
      week, Brady completed 33-of-46 passes for 269 yards and one touchdown as the
      Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams by a score of 26–10.[340] The Patriots  win
      against the Rams gave Brady his 201st career victory, including playoff games,
      breaking Peyton Manning s record of 200.[341] In Week 14, Brady completed 25
      of 38 passes for 406 yards, three touchdowns, and one interception during a
      30–23 victory against the Baltimore Ravens on Monday Night Football.[342]

      The next week, Brady completed 16-of-32 passes for 188 yards in a 16–3 victory
      in Denver.[343] With this victory, the Patriots clinched an eighth consecutive
      AFC East title and a seventh consecutive first-round bye in the playoffs, both
      NFL records.[344] On December 20, 2016, Brady was named to the Pro Bowl for
      the eighth straight season and 12th time overall.[345][346] In Week 16, Brady
      threw for 17 of 27 passes for 214 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions
      as he led the Patriots to a 41–3 win over the Jets.[347] In Week 17, Brady completed
      25-of-33 passes for 276 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions in a 35–14
      victory over the Miami Dolphins in the regular season finale that gave the Patriots
      home field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.[348] Brady s 276 yards against
      Miami moved him ahead of former Miami quarterback Dan Marino into fourth place
      on the NFL s all-time passing yards list. Brady s three touchdowns against Miami
      also gave him 28 passing touchdowns against two interceptions for the regular
      season. This broke the previous record of Nick Foles s 27:2 TD:INT ratio which
      was set in 2013 with the Philadelphia Eagles.[349] Brady was named to the AP
      All-Pro Second Team, behind Matt Ryan of the Atlanta Falcons, who was named
      to the AP All-Pro First Team.[350] Brady was also ranked first on the NFL Top
      100 Players of 2017 as the best player in the league, becoming the first player
      to be named as #1 twice since the listing started.[351]

      Brady hoisting the Vince Lombardi Trophy for the fifth time in his career after
      winning Super Bowl LI

      Brady and the Patriots began their postseason run in the Divisional Round, hosting
      the Houston Texans, who had the league s No. 1 total defense. Brady completed
      18-of-38 passes for 287 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions as the
      Patriots won 34–16, clinching a record sixth consecutive trip to the AFC Championship
      Game.[352] The Patriots then defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers, 36–17. Against
      the Steelers, Brady completed 32 of 42 passes for 384 yards, three touchdowns,
      and no interceptions. The win gave Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick
      their record seventh conference title as a quarterback–head coach tandem, and
      the Patriots an NFL record ninth Super Bowl appearance.[353]

      Brady and the Patriots faced the NFC champion Atlanta Falcons—who boasted the
      league s highest scoring offense—in Super Bowl LI at NRG Stadium in Houston,
      Texas on Sunday, February 5, 2017. Brady threw for 43 completions on 62 attempts
      for 466 passing yards—all Super Bowl records at the time. Brady also threw for
      two touchdowns and an interception. After trailing 28–3 midway through the third
      quarter, Brady and the Patriots scored 25 unanswered points to tie the game
      at the end of regulation. This resulted in the first overtime in Super Bowl
      history. After winning the overtime coin toss, Brady led the Patriots down the
      field to score a touchdown and win the game by a score of 34–28,[354] completing
      the largest comeback win in both team history and Super Bowl history. With the
      victory, Brady won his fifth Super Bowl, which set a record for most Super Bowl
      victories of any quarterback in history and tied defensive player Charles Haley
      for the most Super Bowl victories for any player. In addition, Brady set another
      record by winning his fourth Super Bowl MVP award for his clutch performance.[355]

      After the game, it was discovered that Brady s jersey had gone missing from
      the Patriots  locker room at NRG Stadium.[356] The FBI, in collaboration with
      Mexican authorities, recovered the jersey from the home of Martin Mauricio Ortega,
      a Mexican tabloid writer, along with Brady s jersey from Super Bowl XLIX.[357]

      On May 12, 2017, Brady was announced as the cover athlete for Madden NFL 18.[358]

      In a CBS interview on May 17, 2017, Charlie Rose asked Brady s wife, Gisele
      Bündchen, if she wanted Brady to retire, despite the fact that he was playing
      at a high level. Bündchen mentioned that Brady suffered from a concussion in
      the 2016 season, saying,  I mean he has concussions pretty much every—I mean
      we don t talk about—but he does have concussions. I don t really think it s
      a healthy thing for anybody to go through.”[359][360]

      Following the Bündchen interview, the NFL released a statement:  We have reviewed
      all reports relating to Tom Brady from the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultants
      and certified athletic trainer spotters who worked at Patriots’ home and away
      2016 season games as well as club injury reports that were sent to the league
      office. There are no records that indicate that Mr. Brady suffered a head injury
      or concussion, or exhibited or complained of concussion symptoms. Today we have
      been in contact with the NFLPA and will work together to gather more information
      from the club s medical staff and Mr. Brady .[361][362] Brady s agent, Don Yee,
      said that Brady was not diagnosed with a concussion during the 2016 season.[363]

      The Patriots opened up their 2017 season in the NFL Kickoff Game on September
      7 at home against the Kansas City Chiefs. Brady had 267 passing yards in the
      game, which the Patriots lost 42–27.[364] In Week 2, Brady threw three touchdown
      passes in the first quarter of a game for the first time in his career in a
      36–20 win over the New Orleans Saints.[365] He finished the game with 447 passing
      yards and three touchdowns, earning him his 28th AFC Offensive Player of the
      Week award.[366] This broke the record previously held by Peyton Manning for
      the most AFC Offensive Player of the Week awards in a career.[367] In Week 3,
      Brady threw for 378 passing yards and five touchdowns as he led the Patriots
      to a 36–33 comeback win against the Houston Texans, a performance that earned
      him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for the second straight week, and
      the 29th for his career.[368] In Week 4, Brady played well again, throwing for
      307 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions, but the Carolina Panthers upset
      the Patriots 33–30 on a last second field goal from Graham Gano as time expired.
      In the Patriots  next game, a narrow 19–14 win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
      on Thursday Night Football, Brady completed 30 out of 40 passes for 303 yards,
      one touchdown, and one interception. With this victory, Brady became the third
      quarterback in NFL history to record 186 career regular season victories, tying
      Peyton Manning and Brett Favre for the most such wins of any quarterback in
      NFL history.[369] On October 10, it was unveiled that Brady was diagnosed with
      an AC joint sprain in his left (non-throwing) shoulder.[370][371] During Week
      6 against the New York Jets, Brady threw for 257 passing yards, two touchdowns,
      and an interception as the Patriots won 24–17. Brady obtained his 187th career
      win, setting the record for most regular season wins in NFL history.[372] The
      next week, the Patriots hosted the Atlanta Falcons in a rematch of Super Bowl
      LI on Sunday Night Football. Brady was efficient, completing 21 of 29 passes
      for 249 yards and two touchdowns as the Patriots defeated the Falcons, 23–7.[373]
      The following week, Brady completed 32-of-47 passes for 333 yards and one touchdown
      in a 21–13 win against the Los Angeles Chargers. With the win against the Chargers,
      the Patriots headed into their bye week with an AFC best 6–2 record.[374]

      Coming off their bye week, Brady and the Patriots traveled to Denver for a Sunday
      Night Football match against the Denver Broncos. The Patriots dominated the
      game, winning 41–16, with Brady completing 25 of 34 passes for 266 yards and
      three touchdowns. For his performance against Denver, Brady was named the AFC
      Offensive Player of the Week for the third time in the season.[375] After spending
      the next week training at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs,
      Colorado, Brady and the Patriots traveled to Mexico City for a special regular
      season match with the Oakland Raiders. Like the previous week, the Patriots
      won big, this time by a final score of 33–8. Brady completed 30 of 37 passes
      for 339 yards and three touchdowns in the win. During Week 12 against the Miami
      Dolphins, Brady finished with 227 passing yards, 4 touchdowns, and an interception
      as the Patriots won 35–17. Brady became the first quarterback at age 40 to throw
      for 4 touchdowns in a game. Brady was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month
      for November.[376] During Week 13 against the Buffalo Bills, Brady finished
      with 258 passing yards and an interception as the Patriots won 23–3. During
      the game, Brady yelled at offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels after failing
      to execute a play properly in the first quarter. Brady claimed that this wasn
      t his first incident with McDaniels, with whom he had worked together for 13
      years, with a  fruitful  relationship.[377][378] The following week, the Patriots
      traveled to Miami to face the Dolphins on Monday Night Football. The Dolphins
      held off a late comeback attempt to defeat the Patriots 27–20, with Brady completing
      24 of 43 passes for 233 yards, a touchdown, and two interceptions.[379] In Week
      15, Brady completed 22 of 35 passes for 298 yards, a touchdown, and an interception
      as he led the Patriots to a 27–24 comeback victory against the Pittsburgh Steelers.[380]
      With this victory, the Patriots secured their ninth straight AFC East division
      title. On December 19, Brady was selected to the Pro Bowl for the 13th time
      in his career.[381][382] On Christmas Eve against the Buffalo Bills, Brady completed
      21 of 28 passes for 224 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception as the Patriots
      won their twelfth game of the season, 37–16.[383] With this win, combined with
      a loss by the Jacksonville Jaguars later in the day, the Patriots clinched a
      first-round bye for the eighth straight year.[384] In the regular season finale
      against the New York Jets on New Year s Eve, Brady completed 18 of 37 passes
      for 190 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions in a 26–6 victory. With
      the win, the Patriots clinched home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.[385]
      Brady finished the 2017 regular season as the NFL s passing yards leader with
      4,577 passing yards, making him the oldest player ever to lead the league in
      passing yards.[386] He was named a first-team All-Pro by the Associated Press
      for the third time in his career.[387] Earning 40 of 50 votes, Brady was named
      the NFL Most Valuable Player for the third time in his career.[388]

      Brady playing in Super Bowl LII

      Brady and the Patriots began their postseason run by hosting the Tennessee Titans
      in the Divisional Round of the playoffs. Brady completed 35 passes out of 53
      attempts for 337 yards, 3 touchdowns, and no interceptions in a 35–14 Patriots
      victory.[389] With the win, the Patriots advanced to the AFC Championship Game
      for the seventh straight year. Days after the divisional round, it was revealed
      that Brady had a minor cut on his right hand, which required stitches.[390]
      Despite this injury, Brady managed to start the AFC Championship Game, where
      the Patriots faced off against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Brady led a fourth
      quarter comeback to lead the Patriots to a 24–20 victory. He finished the game
      with 26 completions out of 38 attempts for 290 passing yards, two passing touchdowns,
      and no interceptions.[391] The win gave Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick
      their eighth conference title as a quarterback–head coach tandem, and the Patriots
      a berth in Super Bowl LII, their tenth Super Bowl appearance as a team, both
      of which extended NFL records. In Super Bowl LII at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis,
      Minnesota, the Patriots faced off against the Philadelphia Eagles and their
      second-string quarterback Nick Foles. Brady completed 28 passes on 48 attempts
      for 3 touchdowns, no interceptions, and a Super Bowl record 505 yards – which
      also set a new record for the most passing yards by a quarterback in any postseason
      game in NFL history. With roughly two minutes remaining in the game and the
      Eagles leading 38–33, Brady was strip-sacked by Brandon Graham. The Eagles recovered
      the fumble and cemented their 41–33 win with a field goal, securing their first
      franchise Super Bowl victory.[392] This was the third time overall that Brady
      had lost in a Super Bowl, becoming the fourth starting quarterback in Super
      Bowl history to lose at least three Super Bowls (Jim Kelly, Fran Tarkenton,
      and John Elway).[393] In addition, this was the first time he had lost a Super
      Bowl to a team and a quarterback other than the New York Giants and Eli Manning,
      respectively.[394]

      Brady started his 19th professional season with 277 passing yards, three touchdowns,
      and one interception in a 27–20 victory over the Houston Texans in the season
      opener.[395][396] After losses to the Jacksonville Jaguars and Detroit Lions
      over the next two games, Brady had 274 passing yards, three touchdowns, and
      two interceptions in a 38–7 victory over the Miami Dolphins in Week 4.[397]
      In the following game, a 38–24 victory over the Indianapolis Colts, he had 341
      passing yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions to go with a rushing
      touchdown. One of his touchdown passes went to Josh Gordon, who became the NFL-record
      71st different player to catch a touchdown from Brady.[398][399] In Week 6,
      a 43–40 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday Night Football, Brady
      had 340 passing yards and a passing touchdown to go with a four-yard rushing
      touchdown.[400] In Week 7, a 38–31 victory over the Chicago Bears, he had 277
      passing yards, three passing touchdowns, and one interception.[401] In Week
      12, against the New York Jets, Brady passed for 283 yards, with two touchdowns
      and no interceptions and a 115.4 passer rating in a 27–13 victory.[402] In Week
      13, Brady reached 1,000 career rushing yards in a 24–10 victory over the Minnesota
      Vikings, becoming the oldest player to reach that mark since 1970.[403] In Week
      15, Brady reached 70,000 passing yards, becoming only the fourth quarterback
      in NFL history to accomplish the feat. He finished with 279 passing yards as
      the Patriots lost 10–17 to the Pittsburgh Steelers.[404] During Week 16 against
      the Buffalo Bills, Brady was limited to 126 passing yards, but the Patriots
      combined for 273 rushing yards and won 24–12, clinching the AFC East pennant
      for the 10th consecutive season and 16th time in 18 years.[405] In Week 17,
      Brady completed 24 of 33 passes for 250 yards, and 4 touchdowns in a 38–3 win
      against the Jets that allowed the Patriots to clinch the AFC s #2 seed and a
      first-round bye in the AFC playoffs.[406][407] Brady finished the season completing
      375 of 570 passes (a 65.8% completion rate), 4,355 yards, 29 touchdowns and
      11 interceptions.[408]

      Following their first-round bye, the Patriots started their playoff run against
      the Los Angeles Chargers in the Divisional Round. The Patriots jumped out to
      a 35–7 halftime lead en route to a 41–28 win that saw Brady complete 34 of 44
      passes for 343 yards, a touchdown, and no interceptions.[409] With the win,
      the Patriots advanced to the AFC Championship Game for the eighth consecutive
      year, this time to face the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium.[410]

      In the AFC Championship Game, the Patriots opened the game with a 80-yard, 15-play
      opening drive capped with a 1-yard Sony Michel rushing touchdown. The Patriots
      went into halftime with a 14–0 lead. However, the Chiefs battled back in the
      second half and Harrison Butker hit a 39-yard field goal for the Chiefs with
      just 8 seconds remaining in regulation to send the game into overtime with a
      score of 31–31. The Patriots won the coin toss to start overtime and elected
      to receive the ball. Brady led the Patriots on a 75-yard drive that resulted
      in a game-winning 2-yard rushing touchdown by Rex Burkhead. With the victory,
      Brady earned a Super Bowl appearance for the third straight season and the ninth
      time overall in his career. Brady finished the game completing 30 of 46 attempts,
      with 348 yards passing, one passing touchdown, and two interceptions.[411] In
      Super Bowl LIII at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, Brady completed
      21 of 35 passes for 262 passing yards and an interception as the Patriots won
      13–3 over the Los Angeles Rams in the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in history.
      With the victory, the Patriots became the second NFL team to win six Super Bowls,
      tying the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most in NFL history. In addition, Brady
      became the first player ever to win six Super Bowls as well as the oldest quarterback
      at 41 years of age to win a Super Bowl.[412][413]

      of that year s Super Bowl.[440][441] In 2009, he appeared as himself in a sixth
      season episode of Entourage.[442] In 2015, he had cameo appearances as fictionalized
      versions of himself in the Entourage movie[443] and Ted 2.[444]

      In 2007, Brady was a model for the Stetson cologne.[445] Brady has endorsed
      brands including Uggs, Under Armour, Movado, Aston Martin and Glaceau Smartwater.

      includes a store to purchase TB12 equipment and merchandise.[451] Later in the

      The snacks contain raw, vegan, and organic ingredients that are also free of
      gluten and dairy.[452] The following month, Brady, alongside Boston Private

      care and training to underprivileged, young athletes.[453] In March 2017, Brady
      moved beyond his snack line and partnered with meal-kit startup Purple Carrot
      to offer his own line of TB12 Performance Meals. The meals utilize whole foods
      and focus on providing nutrients for workout recovery.[454][455] On September
      19, 2017, Simon & Schuster published Brady s first book, The TB12 Method: How
      to Achieve a Lifetime of Sustained Peak Performance. Within 48 hours, it had
      become a number one best-seller on Amazon.com.[456] The book also reached #1
      on the The New York Times  weekly Best Sellers list, to be featured in the edition
      of October 8, 2017.[457]

      Filmmaker Gotham Chopra filmed Brady during the 2017 offseason and regular season
      for a Facebook Watch documentary series entitled Tom vs Time. According to The
      New York Times, the documentary follows Brady as he  conducts his ongoing subversion
      campaign against the actuarial tables of quarterback longevity. [458]

      18, 2007, Moynahan confirmed to People magazine that she was more than three
      months pregnant with Brady s child.[459][460] Brady and Moynahan ended their

      in Santa Monica, California.[466] Together, they have two children: a son named
      Benjamin Rein born in December 2009,[467] and a daughter named Vivian Lake born

      (meaning 80% alkaline and 20% acidic), early bed time, resistance training and
      neuroplasticity training.[471]

      George W. Bush.[472] In 2004, he told ESPN The Magazine that being a U.S. Senator
      would be his  craziest ambition .[473][474]

      Brady is a friend of President Donald Trump;[475][476] in 2017, Brady indicated
      he had known Trump  for 16 years .[477] At a political event in New Hampshire
      on the day before the 2016 presidential election, Trump said he had received
      a call from Brady, and that Brady told him  Donald, I support you, you re my
      friend, and I voted for you.  However, after Gisele Bündchen was asked directly
      on Instagram whether she and Brady backed Trump, Bündchen answered  NO! .[478]
      After a Trump campaign  Make America Great Again  cap was photographed in Brady
      s locker, Brady said that Bündchen told him not to discuss politics anymore,
      which he thought was a  good decision .[479] Brady did not join most of his
      teammates from the New England Patriots in visiting Trump and the White House
      in April 2017, citing  personal family matters .[480]

      While there has been speculation that Brady would run for political office,[481]

      In 2018, he endorsed Republican Helen Brady (no relation), who was running for
      State Auditor of Massachusetts. Brady lost the election to Democrat Suzanne
      Bump.[485][486][487]

      Brady and his family adhere to a controversial, strict diet, the  TB12 Method
      , that has attracted much media attention.[488][489] He advocates drinking 1/32
      of one s body weight in water daily.[490] He avoids consumption of most fruits,
      mushrooms, tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, coffee, Gatorade, white sugar or flour,
      gluten, dairy, soda, cereal, white rice, potatoes, and bread.[491][492]

      Other professional athletes including Kirk Cousins[493] and Mark Scheifele have
      started to adopt his regimen.[494][495]

      The U.S. National Anthem

      The history of the United States is vast and complex, but can be broken down
      into moments and time periods that divided, unified, and changed the United
      States into the country it is today:

      The American Revolution (sometimes referred to as the American War of Independence
      or the Revolutionary War) was a conflict that lasted from 1775-1783 and allowed
      the original 13 colonies to remain independent from Great Britain.

      American politician and soldier George Washington became the first president
      of the United States in 1789, serving two terms.

      Beginning in Great Britain in the late 1790s, the Industrial Revolution eventually
      made its way to the United States and changed the focus of the U.S. economy
      and the way it manufactured products.

      In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson agreed to the Louisiana Purchase, successfully
      adding 530 million acres of land to the United States. The area was purchased
      from France for $15 million. The following year, President Jefferson assigned
      Meriwether Lewis (who asked for help from William Clark) to head west and explore
      the newly purchased land. It took about a year and a half for the duo to reach
      the west coast.

      The War of 1812 resolved outstanding tensions between the United States and
      Great Britain. The two year war ended British military posts on U.S. soil and
      British interference with American trade.

      The American Civil War divided the United States in two—the Northern States
      versus the Southern States. The outcome of the four year battle (1861-1865)
      kept the United States together as one whole nation and ended slavery.

      On December 17, 1903, brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright became the first people
      to maintain a controlled flight in a powered, heavier-than-air machine. The
      Wright Flyer only flew for 12 seconds for a distance of 120 feet, but the technology
      would change the modern world forever.

      On April 6, 1917, the United States entered World War I by declaring war on
      Germany.

      After nearly 100 years of protests, demonstrations, and sit-ins, women of the
      United States were officially granted the right to vote after the 19th Amendment
      was ratified on August 26, 1920.

      The worst economic crisis to happen in the United States occurred when the stock
      market crashed in October 1929, resulting in the Great Depression.

      World War II officially begins in September 1939 after Germany invades Poland.
      The United States didn’t enter the war until after the Japanese attack on Pearl
      Harbor on December 7, 1941.

      On August 6 and August 9, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on
      the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, effectively ending World War
      II.

      After World War II, an agreement was reached to divide Korea into two parts:
      a northern half to be controlled by the Soviet Union and a southern half to
      be controlled by the United States. The division was originally meant as a temporary
      solution, but the Soviet Union managed to block elections that were held to
      elect someone to unify to the country. Instead, the Soviet Union sent North
      Korean troops across the 38th parallel leading to the three-year-long (1950-1953)
      Korean War.

      From 1954-1968, the African-American Civil Rights movement took place, especially
      in the Southern states. Fighting to put an end to racial segregation and discrimination,
      the movement resulted in the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the 1965 Voting Rights Act,
      and the 1968 Fair Housing Act.

      The Vietnam War was a nearly 20-year battle (November 1, 1955–April 30, 1975)
      between North Vietnam and South Vietnam. North Vietnam won the war and Vietnam
      became a unified country.

      The Apollo 11 mission (July 16-24, 1969) allowed United States astronauts Neil
      Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin to become the first humans to walk on the
      moon’s surface.

      The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, changed the United States forever.
      Less than a month later (October 7, 2001) the United States began the War in
      Afghanistan, which is still happening today.

      On March 20, 2003, the United States invaded and occupied Iraq. The war lasted
      for more than eight years before it was officially declared over on December
      18, 2011.

      In 2008, Barack Obama became the first African-American to be elected president
      of the United States.

      The Library of Congress has compiled a list of historic events for each day
      of the year, titled  This Day in History.  The website is updated daily and
      visitors can view the previous day s history as well as whatever documents,
      pictures, or outside information is available for each historical event.

      The American History section of the Library of Congress is separated by time
      period or subject and offers an in-depth look at the history of the United States.

      The Declaration of Independence is one of the most important documents in the
      history of the United States.

      It took Thomas Jefferson 17 days to write the Declaration of Independence.

      On July 2, 1776, Congress voted to declare independence from Great Britain.

      On July 4, 1776, Congress voted to accept the Declaration of Independence, marking
      July 4 as Independence Day.

      The foundation of the American government, its purpose, form, and structure,
      are in the Constitution of the United States. The Constitutional Convention
      adopted the Constitution on September 17, 1787.

      The Bill of Rights is the first 10 amendments to the Constitution. It guarantees
      greater constitutional protection for individual liberties and lists specific
      prohibitions on government power. There are 27 Constitutional Amendments in
      all. The 27th Amendment, which was originally proposed in 1789, was not ratified
      until 1992.

      Where to View the Constitution

      You can view the original, parchment copy of the Constitution at the National
      Archives Building. You can also view an online copy of the U.S. Constitution
      or order a printed copy of the Constitution.

      The United States Armed Forces date to 1775, when America needed a defense force
      to protect the original 13 colonies from a British invasion. Today, there are
      five branches:

      The United States Army is the oldest (established June 14, 1775) and largest
      of the five branches. Soldiers are responsible for performing land-based military
      operations.

      The United States Navy mainly operates from the waters (seas and oceans) providing
      protection both in the water and in the air.

      The modern-day United States Air Force is the youngest of the five branches
      (established September 18, 1947). Before the modern-day Air Force was created,
      it was an arm of the U.S. Army, dating to 1907. Airmen are responsible for carrying
      out aerial military operations.

      The United States Marine Corps is the smallest of the four branches under the
      Department of Defense. Marines provide both land and sea support to the Army,
      Navy, Air Force, and, in times of war, Coast Guard.

      The United States Coast Guard is the only branch that falls under the Department
      of Homeland Security. The Coast Guard is multi-functional, with many peacetime
      missions. Coast Guard missions include: maritime search and rescue, maritime
      law enforcement, marine environmental protection, and ports, waterways, and
      coastal security.

      Military museums offer visitors insight into the history, defining moments,
      and current status of the branches of the U.S. Armed Forces:

      The U.S. Army does not have an official museum but there are interactive exhibits
      available online as well as smaller, more focused museums located across the
      country.

      There is a plan in progress to develop a national museum in the Washington,
      DC, area.

      The National Museum of the Marine Corps is located next to the Marine Corps
      Base in Quantico, Virginia, and features exhibits on the actions of Marines
      during World Wars I and II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War.

      Located in downtown Washington, DC, the National Museum of the U.S. Navy has
      exhibits on different navigational tools used by the Navy as well as artifacts
      captured by the Navy.

      The National Museum of the U.S. Air Force is located at Wright-Patterson Air
      Force Base in Ohio and features a collection of aircraft used throughout the
      history of the Air Force.

      The United States Coast Guard Museum is located on the campus of the Coast Guard
      Academy in New London, Connecticut, and features artifacts from the nearly 230-year
      history of the Coast Guard.

      Across the United States, military memorials and monuments commemorate wars,
      battles, and those who lived and served during those times. Popular points of
      interest by each major war include:

      American Revolution:

      Valley Forge National Historical Park is located in Pennsylvania and is a reminder
      of the sacrifices made by soldiers at one of the best-known locations from the
      American Revolution.

      Adams National Historic Park is located in Massachusetts and offers visitors
      a chance to see the birthplace of Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams.

      Morristown National Historic Park in New Jersey is a memorial to those members
      of George Washington’s army who survived an unusually cold winter.

      The USS Constitution Museum, located in Massachusetts, provides interactive
      exhibits on life on the frigate as well as how the ship handled different battles.

      Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland, is the location that inspired the writing
      of the Star-Spangled Banner.

      The African American Civil War Memorial and Museum in Washington, DC, has collections
      and exhibits to help visitors remember the African Americans who fought in the
      Civil War.

      The National Park Service has an online Civil War database that contains information
      on the soldiers and sailors who fought in the Civil War.

      Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park in Virginia reminds visitors
      of some of the Civil War’s most devastating battles.

      Gettysburg National Military Park is located on the site of the Civil War’s
      deadliest battle—and is often referred to as the turning point of the entire
      war.

      The National Museum of Civil War Medicine in Maryland has exhibits on those
      who volunteered to take care of the sick and wounded during the Civil War.

      President s Park in Washington, DC, includes monuments to the thousands of fallen
      American soldiers of the First and Second Infantry Divisions.

      The National World War I Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri, has various
      artifacts from the war—including uniforms, tanks and weapons, and illustrations,
      political cartoons and soldiers  drawings created during the Great War.

      The US Marine Corps War Memorial, also known as the Iwo Jima Memorial, is located
      in Virginia near Arlington National Cemetery.

      The World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument, near Pearl Harbor in
      Honolulu, Hawaii, includes the USS Arizona Memorial and exhibits on events that
      occurred in the Pacific Theater during the war.

      The National WW II Memorial in Washington, DC, is a tribute to those who served
      during the war in battle and at home.

      The Korean War Veterans Memorial depicts those who fought in the three-year
      war.

      In Washington, DC, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial has the names of the 58,000
      Americans who died during the conflict etched into the walls of the monument.

      Visit the National Park Service to search for more military memorials and monuments
      located throughout the United States.

      The Star-Spangled Banner is the national anthem of the United States of America.
      To celebrate a victory over British forces during the War of 1812, U.S. soldiers
      raised a large American flag at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland, on September
      14, 1814. Inspired by those events, Francis Scott Key wrote a poem called  Defence
      of Fort M Henry,  which eventually became the Star Spangled Banner and the United
      States national anthem.'

      Tree Myth

      Author Philip Levy discusses his book, Where the Cherry Tree Grew. Levy explains
      the history, mythology, and archeology of Ferry Farm, Washington s boyhood home
      in Fredericksburg, Virginia.

      The Man and Myth

      The story of the cherry tree is not the only Washington-related myth! Mount
      Vernon invites you to separate fact from fiction and learn about the real George
      Washington.

      Washington grew up with little formal schooling. However, from the joint influence
      of role models and literature, Washington steadfastly preserved the importance
      of ideas ranging from honor to humanity to hospitality.

      The cherry tree myth is the most well-known and longest enduring legend about
      George Washington. In the original story, when Washington was six years old
      he received a hatchet as a gift and damaged his father’s cherry tree. When his
      father discovered what he had done, he became angry and confronted him. Young
      George bravely said, “I cannot tell a lie…I did cut it with my hatchet.” Washington’s
      father embraced him and rejoiced that his son’s honesty was worth more than
      a thousand trees.1

      Ironically, this iconic story about the value of honesty was invented by one
      of Washington’s first biographers, an itinerant minister and bookseller named
      Mason Locke Weems. After Washington’s death in 1799 people were anxious to learn
      about him, and Weems was ready to supply the demand. As he explained to a publisher
      in January 1800, “Washington you know is gone! Millions are gaping to read something
      about him…My plan! I give his history, sufficiently minute…I then go on to show
      that his unparalleled rise and elevation were due to his Great Virtues.”2 Weems’
      biography, The Life of Washington, was first published in 1800 and was an instant
      bestseller. However the cherry tree myth did not appear until the book’s fifth
      edition was published in 1806.

      Although there were other myths about Washington in Weems’s book, the cherry
      tree myth became the most popular. Weems had several motives when he wrote The
      Life of Washington and the cherry tree myth. Profit was certainly one of them;
      he rightly assumed that if he wrote a popular history book about Washington
      it would sell. Weems was also able to counter the early tradition of deifying
      Washington by focusing on his private virtues, rather than his public accomplishments.
      A Federalist admirer of order and self-discipline, Weems wanted to present Washington
      as the perfect role model, especially for young Americans.

      The cherry tree myth and other stories showed readers that Washington’s public
      greatness was due to his private virtues. Washington’s achievements as a general
      and president were familiar to people in the early nineteenth century, but little
      was known about his relationship with his father, who died when Washington was
      only eleven years old. As one Pennsylvanian observed, “The facts and anecdotes
      collected by the author are well calculated to exhibit the character of that
      illustrious man, and Christian hero.”3 Weems knew what the public wanted to
      read, and as a result of his success he is considered one of the fathers of
      popular history.

      Weems wrote his version of the cherry tree myth to appeal to a broad audience,
      but decades later William Holmes McGuffey composed a series of grammar school
      textbooks that recast the anecdote as a children s story. McGuffey was a Presbyterian
      minister and a college professor who was passionate about teaching morality
      and religion to children. His books, known as McGuffey’s Readers, gave him the
      perfect opportunity. First published in 1836, the readers remained in print
      for nearly a hundred years and sold over 120 million copies.

      McGuffey s version of the cherry tree myth appeared in his Eclectic Second Reader
      for almost twenty years, including the German-language edition from 1854. In
      McGuffey s version of the story, Washington s language was formalized, and he
      showed more deference to his father’s authority. For example, when Washington’s
      father explains the sin of lying, McGuffey has young George respond tearfully,  Father,
      do I ever tell lies?”4

      As ministers concerned with moral and religious reform, McGuffey and Weems had
      similar motives for writing. Both men also believed that the best way to improve
      the moral fiber of society was to educate children. Washington provided the
      perfect role model, and McGuffey turned the cherry tree myth into a story specifically
      aimed at children. Follow-up questions at the end of McGuffey’s cherry tree
      story reinforce its message: “How did his father feel toward him when he made
      his confession? What may we expect by confessing our faults?”5

      By the 1830s, the cherry tree myth was firmly entrenched in American culture,
      as the case of Joice Heth clearly shows. Heth was an elderly enslaved woman
      purchased by P.T. Barnum in 1835. He made her into a sideshow attraction, billing
      her as the slave who had raised George Washington. (If true, this would have
      made her 161 years old.) Heth had many physical characteristics of extreme old
      age, most likely due to her lifetime in slavery. The stories she told about
      Washington--including the cherry tree myth--were right out of Weems. Heth was
      credible because she was telling stories that people already knew.

      The cherry tree myth has endured for more than two hundred years probably because
      we like the story, which has become an important part of Americans  cultural
      heritage. It has been featured in comic strips and cartoons, especially political
      cartoons. Americans like to use the myth as a standard for politicians; presidents
      from William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt to Richard Nixon, George W. Bush,
      and Barack Obama have been featured in cherry-tree themed cartoons. The longevity
      of the cherry tree myth is demonstrative of both American ideals and Washington’s
      legacy.

    - 'George Washington Was a Master of Deception

      The Founding Fathers relied on deceit in championing American independence—and
      that has lessons for the present.

      Contributing editor at The Atlantic

      The French military leader Marquis de Lafayette and General George Washington
      at the Valley Forge encampment of the Continental Army during the winter of
      1777–78AP

      As we celebrate Thanksgiving weekend, a holiday first declared by George Washington’s
      presidential proclamation in 1789, it is worth remembering that deception played
      a pivotal role in America’s birth. Our shining city on the hill owes much to
      the dark arts. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and other Founding Fathers
      are remembered today as virtuous creators of a bold new democracy. But they
      were also cunning manipulators of their information environment—a side of the
      founding story that has often been neglected by history.

      George Washington’s inability to tell a lie is a lie. That old cherry-tree fable—in
      which young George admits to his father that he did, indeed, chop down the tree
      with his hatchet—was invented by a Washington biographer named Mason Locke Weems
      in 1806 to boost his book sales. In truth, Washington was an avid spymaster
      with a talent for deception that would remain unequaled by American presidents
      for the next 150 years. During the Revolutionary War, Washington was referred
      to by his own secret code number (711), made ready use of ciphers and invisible
      ink, developed an extensive network of spies that reported on British troop
      movements and identified American traitors, and used all sorts of schemes to
      protect his forces, confuse his adversaries, and gain advantage. His military
      strategy was to outsmart and outlast the enemy, not outfight him. He used intelligence
      to avoid more battles than he fought, and to trick the British into standing
      down when standing up could have meant the end of the Continental Army.

      Cassandra Good: Did George Washington “have a couple of things in his past”?

      Washington began using deception soon after he took command of the Continental
      Army in 1775. After a summer of skirmishes around Boston, rebel gunpowder was
      nearly gone; Washington’s soldiers had enough only for nine bullets per man.
      To hide this potentially fatal weakness from the British while he scrambled
      to get supplies, Washington ordered that fake gunpowder casks be filled with
      sand and shipped to depots where they would be spotted by British spies. He
      also ordered a secret paramilitary mission to seize gunpowder stores in Bermuda
      that failed only because another secret rebel mission had gotten there first
      but nobody bothered to tell Washington. Throughout the war, Washington wrote
      reports inflating his troop strength that were designed to fall into the hands
      of traitors within his own ranks or agents hiding among the British. During
      the brutal winter of 1777–78 at Valley Forge, with his troops starving, freezing,
      and dwindling in number, Washington penned fake documents that referred to phantom
      infantry and cavalry regiments to convince British General Sir William Howe
      that the rebels were too strong to attack. It worked. Had Howe known the truth
      and pressed his advantage, the Continental Army might not have survived the
      winter.

      Washington’s deceptions even involved French bread. On August 19, 1781, he confided
      in his diary, “French bakery to veil our real movements and create apprehensions
      for Staten Island.” Because French bread was a major source of food for the
      troops, Washington bet that stationing French bake ovens in New Jersey would
      help convince British General Sir Henry Clinton that French and American forces
      were planning to remain in the New York area and attack Staten Island when in
      fact they were marching south, to attack Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown, Virginia.
      The deception was convincing, and it helped win the war. Washington was able
      to muster superior forces and slow British reinforcements, leading to Cornwallis’s
      surrender at Yorktown. Washington wrote later that victory depended on fooling
      even his own troops. “Nor were less pains taken to deceive our own Army,” he
      wrote to Noah Webster in 1788, “for I had always conceived, when the imposition
      did not completely take place at home, it could never sufficiently succeed abroad.”

      Meanwhile, in Paris, Benjamin Franklin secured pivotal French support for the
      war through a combination of diplomacy and duplicity. Wearing homespun clothes
      and a coonskin cap, Franklin carefully cultivated his image as a virtuous and
      simple countryman seeking independence from the domineering British—a ploy that
      capitalized on French views of the British and made him wildly popular in French
      social circles. At the same time, Franklin waged a covert propaganda campaign
      from his Paris basement, where he set up a printing press and wrote articles
      designed to sway opinion across Europe. A printer by trade, Franklin even imported
      European paper and type to make his documents look more authentic.

      Some of Franklin’s writings were outright lies. In 1777, for example, he wrote
      a fake letter from a German prince to the commander of mercenary troops fighting
      with the British in America in which he complains he is being cheated from money
      owed to him and tells the commander to let wounded soldiers die so the British
      will pay more. The letter created an uproar in Europe over Britain’s use of
      mercenaries. In 1782, Franklin created a forgery of a Boston newspaper that
      included fake local news and even fake advertisements. The main “story” quoted
      a letter from Captain Samuel Gerrish of the New England militia claiming that
      the British royal governor of Canada was paying Indian allies for American scalps,
      and that many of the scalps sold were from women and children. The story was
      picked up and used by Whig opponents of the war in Britain. Franklin’s use of
      deception was so skillful, the CIA named him a Founding Father of American intelligence
      a century later.

      America’s revolutionary experience with deception suggests two enduring lessons.
      The first is that deception almost always unravels. Washington never expected
      his deceits to last long. They were used to buy time—holding enemies at bay
      for days, weeks, maybe months. Franklin operated on a longer timetable to influence
      opinion and secure alliances during the war, but he never assumed his lies would
      remain intact. In fact, they didn’t; we now know that Franklin’s own American
      delegation in Paris was heavily penetrated by a British agent.

      The second lesson is that deception is a dangerous animal, and therefore must
      be used with great care, to advance a truly just cause. One key difference between
      the past and the present isn’t the use of half-truths, spin, lies, and deception.
      It’s their purpose. The Founders knowingly used the dark arts for a noble collective
      end. Their purpose was to deceive and divide British troops, unify domestic
      compatriots, and woo French allies to forge a new nation. Their audacious experiment
      sought to grant much greater political power to the people rather than live
      under the yoke of a distant king. It was an inspiring and unifying enterprise
      worthy of the deception it required.'
