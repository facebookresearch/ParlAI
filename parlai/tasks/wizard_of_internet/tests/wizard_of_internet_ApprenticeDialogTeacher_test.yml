    text: All four movies in the Toy Story series are great. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen,
      and Don Rickles are all truly great actors and the creativity of the Pixar Animation
      Studios team is really top notch.

    - I once heard someone erased progress on it like a saved file but someone had
      it on their laptop or something.

    text: You're right. The quality of all of Pixar's movies have increased over the
      years. This is due, in no small part, to the fact that they have long term teams
      that work together on multiple projects. Further, Pixar, as a company, cares
      more about creating high quality movies than they do making the most money possible.
      This is their company's culture and the reason for their continuing success.

    text: 4That is a crazy story. Someone totally deleted Toy Story 2 while it was
      in development (the result of a badly written program that just started deleting
      files on their server). But, the project was saved because a woman, who was
      on maternit6y leave, had saved the movie onto her laptop.  I am sure thy have
      fixed their back up systems after this.
