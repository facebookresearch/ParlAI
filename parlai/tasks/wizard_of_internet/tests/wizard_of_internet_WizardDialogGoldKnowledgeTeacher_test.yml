      Every Kid s Fantasy

      3 February 2009 | by alexkolokotronis – See all my reviews

      Toy Story is the film that started Pixar Animated Studios into its long string
      of never ending success. What Pixar does is not just absorb the younger demographic
      and keep the older ones mildly entertained. It completely absorbs everyone watching
      no matter the age or the level of maturity, films of Pixar, starting from Toy
      Story, have kept a certain magical touch around it with an unexpected amount
      of depth. Everyone as a child imagines their toys will come alive and go on
      their own adventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does not
      attract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather with its material.
      The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned
      voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting
      for animated films as there is to a live-action one. As a result of this Pixar
      stays faithful to its material and creates a great genuine and warm feeling
      around the film and its characters.'

      1995 American animated film directed by John Lasseter

      November 19, 1995 (1995-11-19) (El Capitan Theatre)

      Toy Story is a 1995 American computer-animated buddy comedy film produced by
      Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The feature film
      directorial debut of John Lasseter, it was the first entirely computer-animated
      feature film, as well as the first feature film from Pixar. The screenplay was
      written by Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen, and Alec Sokolow from a
      story by Lasseter, Stanton, Pete Docter, and Joe Ranft. The film features music
      by Randy Newman, and was executive-produced by Steve Jobs and Edwin Catmull.
      It features the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn,
      John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney, Annie Potts, R. Lee Ermey, John Morris, Laurie
      Metcalf, and Erik von Detten.

      Taking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys come to life when humans
      are not present, the plot focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned
      pull-string cowboy doll named Woody and an astronaut action figure, Buzz Lightyear,
      as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of their owner Andy
      Davis, to friends who work together to be reunited with him after being separated.

      Following the success of Pixar s 1988 short film Tin Toy, the company was approached
      by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film told from a small toy
      s perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which
      were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film s tone to be  edgier . After several
      disastrous story reels, production was halted and the script was rewritten to
      better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired:  toys deeply want children
      to play with them, and [...] this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions
      . The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced
      the film under only minor financial constraints.

      Toy Story premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, California, on
      November 19, 1995, and was released in North America on November 22, 1995. It
      was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend,[4] eventually earning
      over $373 million at the worldwide box office. It was acclaimed by critics and
      audiences, who praised the technical innovation of the 3D animation, the wit
      and thematic sophistication of the screenplay, the musical score, and the voice
      performances of Hanks and Allen; it is considered by many to be one of the best
      animated films ever made.[5] The film received three Academy Award nominations,
      including Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Song for  You ve Got a Friend
      in Me , and Best Original Score, as well as winning a Special Achievement Academy
      Award.[6] In 2005, its first year of eligibility, it was inducted into the National
      Film Registry for being  culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant
      .[7]

      In addition to home media and theatrical re-releases, Toy Story-inspired material
      includes toys, video games, theme park attractions, spin-offs, merchandise,
      and three sequels—Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010) and Toy Story 4 (2019)—all
      of which garnered commercial success and critical acclaim. A spin-off TV series
      called Buzz Lightyear of Star Command aired from 2000 to 2001, starting with
      a direct-to-video film, Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins.[8][9]

      In a world where toys are living things but pretend to be lifeless when humans
      are present, a group of toys, owned by a boy named Andy Davis, are caught off-guard
      when Andy s birthday party is moved up a week, as his family (including his
      mother and infant sister Molly) is preparing to move the following week. Andy
      s toys—including Bo Peep, Mr. Potato Head, Rex the dinosaur, Hamm the piggy
      bank and Slinky Dog—fear they will be replaced by new toys that Andy receives
      during the party. To ease the situation, Sheriff Woody—the toys  leader and
      Andy s favorite toy—sends out army men, led by Sarge, to spy on the party and
      report the gift arrivals to the other toys via baby monitors. The toys are relieved
      when the party appears to end without any of them being supplanted by newer
      toys, but then Andy receives a surprise gift: a Buzz Lightyear action figure.

      Buzz thinks he is a real space ranger who has crash-landed on a strange planet.
      Buzz quickly impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins
      to favor him, which makes Woody feel rejected compared to the newer, sleeker
      and more advanced Buzz. Two days before the move, Andy s mother tells him that
      he can only bring one toy to a family outing at the Pizza Planet restaurant.
      Knowing that Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap Buzz behind a desk
      but ends up knocking him out of the window, causing most of the other toys (except
      Slinky and Bo) to accuse Woody of  murdering  Buzz out of jealousy. Before they
      can exact revenge, Andy arrives and, after failing to find Buzz, takes Woody.

      When the family stops for gas, Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on their
      van. The two fight, falling out of the van in the process, and the family drives
      away, stranding them. They manage to reach Pizza Planet by hitching a ride on
      a delivery truck. Buzz, still believing he is a real space ranger despite Woody
      s attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a crane game full of
      alien toys, where they are retrieved by Andy s sadistic, toy-destroying neighbor,
      Sid Phillips. At Sid s house, the two watch in horror as Sid steals his sister
      Hannah s doll, claiming the doll is sick, and then performs  surgery  to replace
      the doll s head with that of a pterodactyl.

      While attempting to escape, Buzz sees a television commercial for a Buzz Lightyear
      action figure and, after failing to fly out a window (breaking his arm off in
      the process), realizes he is just a toy and becomes despondent. Woody attempts
      to signal Andy s toys for help, but they misunderstand his gesture and ignore
      him. Sid s mutant toys fix Buzz s arm, and Woody restores Buzz s confidence
      by telling him about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy. The next morning,
      as Sid is about to launch Buzz on a firework rocket, Woody and the mutant toys
      come to life in front of Sid, terrifying him into no longer mistreating toys.
      Woody bids the mutant toys farewell and escapes with Buzz—only to see Andy and
      his family departing for their new home.

      The duo try to make it to the moving truck, but Sid s dog Scud sees them and
      gives chase. Buzz saves Woody from Scud but is left behind, so Woody attempts
      to rescue him with Andy s remote-controlled car, RC. Thinking that Woody is  killing  RC
      as well, the other toys attack and toss him off the truck. Buzz and RC retrieve
      Woody; the other toys realize their mistake and begin to help, but RC s batteries
      become depleted before he reaches the truck. Realizing that Sid s rocket is
      still strapped to Buzz s back, Woody ignites it, hurtling them towards the truck.
      Woody throws RC into the truck before he and Buzz soar into the air; Buzz opens
      his wings to free himself from the rocket just before it explodes, and he glides
      with Woody to safety inside a box in the Davis s van, right next to Andy, who
      concludes they were in the car all along.

      On Christmas Day at their new home, Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissance
      mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals; one of the toys is Mrs. Potato
      Head, to Mr. Potato Head s delight. As Woody jokingly asks what might be worse
      than Buzz, they discover Andy s new gift is a puppy, and the two share a worried
      smile.

      The entrance to Pixar s studio lot in Emeryville, California

      Director John Lasseter s first experience with computer animation was during
      his work as an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation, when two of his friends
      showed him the light-cycle scene from Tron. It was an eye-opening experience
      which awakened Lasseter to the possibilities offered by the new medium of computer-generated
      animation.[10] Lasseter tried to pitch The Brave Little Toaster as a fully computer-animated
      film to Disney, but the idea was rejected and Lasseter was fired.[11] He then
      went on to work at Lucasfilm and in 1986, he became a founding member of Pixar.
      In 1986, Pixar was purchased by entrepreneur and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve
      Jobs.[12] At Pixar, Lasseter created short, computer-animated films to show
      off the Pixar Image Computer s capabilities. In 1988 Lasseter produced the short
      film Tin Toy told from the perspective of a toy and referencing Lasseter s love
      of classic toys. Tin Toy won the 1988 Academy Award for Best Animated Short
      Film, the first computer-generated film to do so.[13]

      Tin Toy gained Disney s attention, and the new team at The Walt Disney Company—CEO
      Michael Eisner and chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg in the film division—began a
      quest to get Lasseter to come back.[13] Lasseter, grateful for Jobs  faith in
      him, felt compelled to stay with Pixar, telling co-founder Ed Catmull,  I can
      go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history. [13] Katzenberg
      realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into
      motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film.[13] Disney had
      always made all their movies in-house and refused to change this. But when Tim
      Burton, who used to work at Disney, wanted to buy back the rights to The Nightmare
      Before Christmas, Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney movie
      outside the studio. This opened the door for Pixar to make their movies outside
      Disney.[14]

      Both sides were willing. Catmull and fellow Pixar co-founder Alvy Ray Smith
      had long wanted to produce a computer-animated feature, but only in the early
      1990s were the computers cheap and powerful enough to make this possible.[15][16]
      In addition, Disney had licensed Pixar s Computer Animation Production System
      (CAPS), and that made it the largest customer for Pixar s computers.[17] Jobs
      made it apparent to Katzenberg that although Disney was happy with Pixar, it
      was not the other way around:  We want to do a film with you,  said Jobs.  That
      would make us happy. [17] At this same time, Peter Schneider, president of Walt
      Disney Feature Animation, was potentially interested in making a feature film
      with Pixar.[15] When Catmull, Smith and head of animation Ralph Guggenheim met
      with Schneider in the summer of 1990, they found the atmosphere to be puzzling
      and contentious. They later learned that Katzenberg intended that if Disney
      were to make a film with Pixar, it would be outside Schneider s purview, which
      aggravated Schneider.[18] After that first meeting, the Pixar contingent went
      home with low expectations and was surprised when Katzenberg called for another
      conference. Catmull, Smith, and Guggenheim were joined by Bill Reeves (head
      of animation research and development), Jobs, and Lasseter. They brought with
      them an idea for a half-hour television special called A Tin Toy Christmas.
      They reasoned that a television program would be a sensible way to gain experience
      before tackling a feature film.[19]

      They met with Katzenberg at a conference table in the Team Disney building at
      the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank.[19] Catmull and Smith considered it would
      be difficult to keep Katzenberg interested in working with the company over
      time. They considered it even more difficult to sell Lasseter and the junior
      animators on the idea of working with Disney, who had a bad reputation for how
      they treated their animators, and Katzenberg, who had built a reputation as
      a micromanaging tyrant.[19] Katzenberg asserted this himself in the meeting:  Everybody
      thinks I m a tyrant. I am a tyrant. But I m usually right. [17] He threw out
      the idea of a half-hour special and eyed Lasseter as the key talent in the room:  John,
      since you won t come work for me, I m going to make it work this way. [17][19]
      He invited the six visitors to mingle with the animators— ask them anything
      at all —and the men did so, finding they all backed up Katzenberg s statements.
      Lasseter felt he would be able to work with Disney and the two companies began
      negotiations.[20] Pixar at this time was on the verge of bankruptcy and needed
      a deal with Disney.[17] Katzenberg insisted that Disney be given the rights
      to Pixar s proprietary technology for making 3-D animation, but Jobs refused.[20]
      In another case, Jobs demanded Pixar would have part ownership of the film and
      its characters, sharing control of both video rights and sequels, but Katzenberg
      refused.[17] Disney and Pixar reached accord on contract terms in an agreement
      dated May 3, 1991, and signed on in early July.[21] Eventually, the deal specified
      that Disney would own the picture and its characters outright, have creative
      control, and pay Pixar about 12.5% of the ticket revenues.[22][23] It had the
      option (but not the obligation) to do Pixar s next two films and the right to
      make (with or without Pixar) sequels using the characters in the film. Disney
      could also kill the film at any time with only a small penalty. These early
      negotiations became a point of contention between Jobs and Eisner for many years.[17]

      An agreement to produce a feature film based on Tin Toy with a working title
      of Toy Story was finalized and production began soon thereafter.[24]

      The original treatment for Toy Story, drafted by Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, and
      Pete Docter, had little in common with the eventually finished film.[25] It
      paired Tinny, the one-man band from Tin Toy, with a ventriloquist s dummy and
      sent them on a sprawling odyssey. Under studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg, Woody
      was the main villain, abusing the other toys until they rallied against him;
      however, after Disney executives saw the storyboards, they relinquished creative
      control to Pixar.[26] The core idea of Toy Story was present from the treatment
      onward, however: that  toys deeply want children to play with them, and that
      this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions. [25] Katzenberg felt the
      original treatment was problematic and told Lasseter to reshape Toy Story as
      more of an odd-couple buddy picture, and suggested they watch some classic buddy
      movies, such as The Defiant Ones and 48 Hrs., in which two characters with different
      attitudes are thrown together and have to bond.[27][28] Lasseter, Stanton, and
      Docter emerged in early September 1991 with the second treatment, and although
      the lead characters were still Tinny and the dummy, the outline of the final
      film was beginning to take shape.[27]

      The script went through many changes before the final version. Lasseter decided
      Tinny was  too antiquated ; the character was first changed to a military action
      figure and then given a space theme. Tinny s name changed to Lunar Larry, then
      Tempus from Morph, and eventually Buzz Lightyear (after astronaut Buzz Aldrin).[29]
      Lightyear s design was modeled on the suits worn by Apollo astronauts as well
      as G.I. Joe action figures. In addition, the green and purple color scheme on
      Lightyear s suit was inspired by Lasseter and his wife, Nancy, whose favorite
      colors were green and purple respectively.[30][31] Woody, the second character,
      was inspired by a Casper the Friendly Ghost doll that Lasseter had when he was
      a child. Originally, Woody was a ventriloquist s dummy with a pull-string (hence
      the name Woody). However, character designer Bud Luckey suggested that Woody
      could be changed to a cowboy ventriloquist dummy. John Lasseter liked the contrast
      between the Western and the science fiction genres and the character immediately
      changed. Eventually, all the ventriloquist dummy aspects of the character were
      deleted, because the dummy was designed to look  sneaky and mean. [32] However
      they kept the name Woody to pay homage to the Western actor Woody Strode.[29]
      The story department drew inspiration from films such as Midnight Run and The
      Odd Couple,[33] and Lasseter screened Hayao Miyazaki s Castle in the Sky (1986)
      for further influence.

      Toy Story s script was strongly influenced by the ideas of screenwriter Robert
      McKee. The members of Pixar s story team—Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Joe Ranft—were
      aware that most of them were beginners at feature-film writing. None of them
      had any feature story or writing credits to their name besides Ranft, who had
      taught a story class at CalArts and done some storyboard work.[32] Seeking insight,
      Lasseter and Docter attended a three-day seminar in Los Angeles given by McKee.
      His principles, grounded in Aristotle s Poetics, dictated that a character emerges
      most realistically and compellingly from the choices that the protagonist makes
      in reaction to his problems.[34] Disney also appointed the duo Joel Cohen and
      Alec Sokolow and, later, Joss Whedon to help develop the script. Whedon found
      that the script wasn t working but had a great structure; he added the character
      of Rex and sought a pivotal role for Barbie.[35] He also re-visioned Buzz Lightyear
      from a dim-witted but cheerful and self-aware character to an action figure
      who isn t aware that he s a toy—an epiphany that transformed the movie.[36]
      The story team continued to touch up the script as production was underway.
      Among the late additions was the encounter between Buzz and the alien squeaky
      toys at Pizza Planet, which emerged from a brainstorming session with a dozen
      directors, story artists, and animators from Disney.[37]

      Katzenberg gave approval for the script on January 19, 1993, at which point
      voice casting could begin.[38] Lasseter always wanted Tom Hanks to play the
      character of Woody. Lasseter claimed Hanks  has the ability to take emotions
      and make them appealing. Even if the character, like the one in A League of
      Their Own, is down-and-out and despicable. [38] Paul Newman, who subsequently
      accepted the role of Doc Hudson in another Pixar film Cars, was considered for
      the role of Woody.[39] Billy Crystal was approached to play Buzz, but turned
      down the role, which he later regretted; he subsequently accepted the role of
      Mike Wazowski in another Pixar film, Monsters, Inc.. In addition to Crystal,
      Bill Murray, Chevy Chase and Jim Carrey were also considered for Buzz.[40][41][42][43][44][45]
      Lasseter took the role to Tim Allen, who was appearing in Disney s Home Improvement,
      and he accepted.[46] Crystal later stated in an interview that he wouldn t have
      been right as Buzz and that Allen was  fantastic  in the role.[47][48]

      To gauge how an actor s voice might fit with a character, Lasseter borrowed
      a common Disney technique: animate a vocal monolog from a well-established actor
      to meld the actor s voice with the appearance or actions of the animated character.[35]
      This early test footage, using Hanks  voice from Turner & Hooch, convinced Hanks
      to sign on to the film.[38][49] Toy Story was both Hanks  and Allen s first
      animated film, and they recorded their lines together to make their characters’
      chemistry and interactions realistic.[50]

      Production shutdown

      Every couple of weeks, Lasseter and his team showed Disney their latest storyboards
      or footage. Pixar impressed Disney with their technical innovation, but convincing
      Disney of the plot was more difficult. At each of Pixar s presentations, Katzenberg
      tore much of it up, giving out detailed comments and notes. Katzenberg wanted
      primarily to add  more edginess  to the two main characters.[28] Disney wanted
      the film to appeal to both children and adults, and they asked for adult references
      to be added to the film.[38] After many rounds of notes from Katzenberg and
      other Disney executives, the general consensus was that Woody had been stripped
      of almost all charm.[28][46] Hanks, while recording the dialogue for the story
      reels, exclaimed at one point that the character was a jerk.[28] Lasseter and
      his Pixar team had the first half of the movie ready to screen, so they brought
      it down to Burbank to show to Katzenberg and other Disney executives on November
      19, 1993—an event they later dubbed the  Black Friday Incident .[38][51] The
      results were disastrous. Schneider—who was never particularly enamored of Katzenberg
      s idea of having outsiders make animation for Disney—declared it a mess and
      ordered that production be stopped immediately.[52] Katzenberg asked colleague
      Thomas Schumacher why the reels were bad. Schumacher replied bluntly:  Because
      it s not their movie any more; it s completely not the movie that John set out
      to make. [51]

      Lasseter was embarrassed by what was on the screen, later recalling,  It was
      a story filled with the most unhappy, mean characters that I ve ever seen.  He
      asked Disney for two weeks to rework the script, and Katzenberg was supportive.[51]
      Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Ranft delivered the news of the production shutdown
      to the production crew, many of whom had left other jobs to work on the project.
      The crew shifted to television commercials while the head writers worked out
      a new script. Although Lasseter attempted to keep morale high by remaining outwardly
      buoyant, the production shutdown was  a very scary time,  recalled story department
      manager BZ Petroff.[53] Schneider had initially wanted to shut down production
      altogether and fire all recently hired animators.[54] Katzenberg put the film
      under the wing of Walt Disney Feature Animation. The Pixar team was pleased
      that the move would give them an open door to counseling from Disney s animation
      veterans. Schneider, however, continued to take a dim view of the project and
      went over Katzenberg s head to urge Eisner to cancel it.[27] Stanton retreated
      into a small, dark, windowless office, emerging periodically with new script
      pages. He and the other story artists then drew the shots on storyboards. Whedon
      came back to Pixar for part of the shutdown to help with the revision, and the
      script was revised in two weeks as promised.[53] When Katzenberg and Schneider
      halted production on Toy Story, Jobs funded the project personally. Jobs did
      not insert himself into the creative process, but instead managed the relationship
      with Disney.[51]

      The Pixar team came back with a new script three months later, with the character
      of Woody altered from being the tyrannical boss of Andy s toys to being their
      wise and caring leader. It also included a more adult-oriented staff meeting
      amongst the toys rather than the juvenile group discussion that had existed
      in earlier drafts. Buzz Lightyear s character was also changed  to make it more
      clear to the audience that he really doesn t realize he s a toy .[54] Katzenberg
      and Schneider approved the new approach and, by February 1994, the film was
      back in production.[51] The voice actors returned in March 1994 to record their
      new lines.[38] When production was greenlit, the crew quickly grew from its
      original size of 24 to 110, including 27 animators, 22 technical directors,
      and 61 other artists and engineers.[55][56] In comparison, The Lion King, released
      in 1994, required a budget of $45 million and a staff of 800.[55] In the early
      budgeting process, Jobs was eager to produce the film as efficiently as possible,
      impressing Katzenberg with his focus on cost-cutting. Despite this, the $17
      million production budget proved inadequate, especially given the major revision
      that was necessary after Katzenberg had pushed them to make Woody too edgy.
      Jobs demanded more funds to complete the film and insisted that Disney was liable
      for the cost overruns. Katzenberg was not willing, but Ed Catmull was able to
      reach a compromise.[51]

      We couldn t have made this movie in traditional animation. This is a story that
      can only really be told with three-dimensional toy characters. ... Some of the
      shots in this film are so beautiful.

      —Tom Schumacher, Vice President of Walt Disney Feature Animation[57]

      Recruiting animators for Toy Story was brisk; the magnet for talent was not
      the mediocre pay but the allure of taking part in the first computer-animated
      feature.[56] Lasseter said of the challenges of computer animation,  We had
      to make things look more organic. Every leaf and blade of grass had to be created.
      We had to give the world a sense of history. So the doors are banged up, the
      floors have scuffs. [38] The film began with animated storyboards to guide the
      animators in developing the characters. 27 animators worked on the film, using
      400 computer models to animate the characters. Each character was first either
      created out of clay or modeled from a computer-drawn diagram before reaching
      the computer-animated design.[58] Once the animators had a model, its articulation
      and motion controls were coded; this allowed each character to move in a variety
      of ways, such as talking, walking, or jumping.[58] Out of all the characters,
      Woody was the most complex, as he required 723 motion controls, including 212
      for his face and 58 for his mouth.[38][59] The first piece of animation, a 30-second
      test, was delivered to Disney in June 1992, when the company requested a sample
      of what the film would look like. Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with a number
      of things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation,
      such as Woody s yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz
      s helmet and the decals on his space suit, or Venetian blind shadows falling
      across Andy s room.[32]

      Every shot in the film passed through the hands of eight different teams. The
      art department gave each shot its color scheme and general lighting.[60] Under
      Craig Good, the layout department then placed the models in the shot, framed
      it by setting the location of the virtual camera, and programmed any camera
      movement. To make the medium feel as familiar as possible, they sought to stay
      within the limits of what might be done in a live-action film with real cameras,
      dollies, tripods, and cranes.[60] Headed by directing animators Rich Quade and
      Ash Brannon, each shot went from Layout to the animation department. Lasseter
      opted against Disney s approach of assigning an animator to work on a character
      throughout a film, but made certain exceptions in scenes where he thought acting
      was particularly critical.[60] The animators used the Menv program to set each
      character in the desired pose. Once a sequence of hand-built poses (or  keyframes
      ) was created, the software built poses for the frames in-between.[61] The animators
      studied videotapes of the actors for inspiration, and Lasseter rejected automatic
      lip-syncing.[61] To sync the characters  mouths and facial expressions to the
      actors  recorded voices, animators spent a week per 8 seconds of animation.[58]

      Afterward, the animators compiled the scenes and developed a new storyboard
      with the computer-animated characters. They then added shading, lighting, visual
      effects, and finally used 300 computer processors to render the film to its
      final design.[58][59] Under Tom Porter, the shading team used RenderMan s shader
      language to create shader programs for each of a model s surfaces. A few surfaces
      in Toy Story came from real objects: a shader for the curtain fabric in Andy
      s room used a scan of actual cloth.[62] Under Galyn Susman and Sharon Calahan,
      the lighting team orchestrated the final lighting of the shot after animation
      and shading. Each completed shot then went into rendering on a  render farm  of
      117 Sun Microsystems computers that ran 24 hours a day.[37] Finished animation
      emerged in a steady drip of around three minutes a week.[63] Depending on its
      complexity, each frame took from 45 minutes up to 30 hours to render. The film
      required 800,000 machine hours and 114,240 frames of animation in total.[38][58][64]
      There are over 77 minutes of animation spread across 1,561 shots.[60] A camera
      team, aided by David DiFrancesco, recorded the frames onto film stock. To fit
      a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, Toy Story was rendered at a mere 1,536 by 922 pixels,
      with each of them corresponding to roughly a quarter-inch of screen area on
      a typical cinema screen.[37] During post-production, the film was sent to Skywalker
      Sound, where the sound effects were mixed with the music score.[59]

      Main article: Toy Story (soundtrack)

      Disney was concerned with Lasseter s position on the use of music. Unlike other
      Disney films of the time, Lasseter did not want the film to be a musical, saying
      it was a buddy film featuring  real toys.  Joss Whedon agreed, saying,  It would
      have been a really bad musical, because it s a buddy movie. It s about people
      who won t admit what they want, much less sing about it. ... Buddy movies are
      about sublimating, punching an arm,  I hate you.  It s not about open emotion.
      [38] However, Disney favored the musical format, claiming  Musicals are our
      orientation. Characters breaking into song is a great shorthand. It takes some
      of the onus off what they re asking for. [38] Disney and Pixar reached a compromise:
      the characters in Toy Story would not break into song, but the film would use
      non-diegetic songs over the action, as in The Graduate, to convey and amplify
      the emotions that Buzz and Woody were feeling.[35] Disney and Lasseter tapped
      Randy Newman to compose the film. The edited Toy Story was due to Newman and
      Gary Rydstrom in late September 1995 for their final work on the score and sound
      design, respectively.[65]

      Lasseter said,  His songs are touching, witty, and satirical, and he would deliver
      the emotional underpinning for every scene. [38] Newman wrote three original
      songs for the film, developing the film s signature song  You ve Got a Friend
      in Me  in one day.[38] The soundtrack for Toy Story was produced by Walt Disney
      Records and was released on November 22, 1995, the week of the film s release.

      Editing and pre-release

      It was difficult for crew members to perceive the film s quality during much
      of the production process when the finished footage was in scattered pieces
      and lacked elements like music and sound design.[63] Some animators felt the
      film would be a significant disappointment commercially but felt animators and
      animation fans would find it interesting.[63] According to Lee Unkrich, one
      of the original editors of Toy Story, a scene cut out of the original final
      edit featured Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently; Unkrich
      decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because
      the movie s creators thought the audience would love Buzz and Woody by that
      point.[66] Another scene, in which Woody tried to get Buzz s attention when
      he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would
      lose the energy of the movie.[66] Peter Schneider had grown optimistic about
      the film as it neared completion, and he announced a United States release date
      of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter
      holiday season.[67]

      Sources indicate that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked confidence in the
      film during its production, and he had been talking to various companies, ranging
      from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar.[51][67] However, as the film
      progressed, Jobs became increasingly excited about it, feeling that he might
      be on the verge of transforming the movie industry.[51] As scenes from the movie
      were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to
      share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of Toy Story that November
      would be the occasion to take Pixar public.[51] A test audience near Anaheim
      in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further
      pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience
      were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as
      to how audiences would respond.[65] The film ended with a shot of Andy s house
      and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told
      Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz
      together, reacting to the news of the puppy.[65]

      The El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, where Toy Story s Los Angeles, California
      s premiere took place on November 19, 1995.

      There were two premieres of Toy Story in November 1995. Disney organized one
      at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles and built a fun house featuring the
      characters, Totally Toy Story, next door.[68] Jobs did not attend; he instead
      rented the Regency, a similar theater in San Francisco, and held his own premiere
      the next night—at which, instead of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, the guests were
      Silicon Valley celebrities such as Larry Ellison and Andy Grove. The dueling
      premieres highlighted an issue between the companies: whether Toy Story was
      a Disney or a Pixar film.[69]  The audience appeared to be captivated by the
      film,  wrote David Price in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch.  Adult-voiced sobs
      could be heard during the quiet moments after Buzz Lightyear fell and lay broken
      on the stairway landing. [70] Toy Story opened on 2,281 screens in the United
      States on November 22, 1995 (before later expanding to 2,574 screens).[70] It
      was paired alongside a reissue of a Roger Rabbit short called Rollercoaster
      Rabbit, while select prints contained The Adventures of André and Wally B..

      The film was also shown at the Berlin International Film Festival out of competition
      from February 15 to 26, 1996.[71][72] Elsewhere, the film opened in March 1996.[67]

      Marketing for the film included $20 million spent by Disney for advertising
      as well as advertisers such as Burger King, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Payless
      ShoeSource paying $125 million in promotions for the film.[73] Marketing consultant
      Al Ries reflected on the promotion:  This will be a killer deal. How can a kid,
      sitting through a one-and-a-half-hour movie with an army of recognizable toy
      characters, not want to own one? [74] Despite this, Disney Consumer Products
      was slow to see the potential of Toy Story.[67] When the Thanksgiving release
      date was announced in January 1995, many toy companies were accustomed to having
      eighteen months to two years of lead time and passed on the project. In February
      1995, Disney took the idea to Toy Fair, a toy industry trade show in New York.
      There, a Toronto-based company with a factory based in China, Thinkway Toys,
      became interested. Although Thinkway was a small player in the industry, mainly
      producing toy banks in the form of film characters, it acquired the worldwide
      master license for Toy Story toys simply because no one else wanted it.[75]
      Walt Disney Home Video put a trailer for the film on seven million copies of
      the VHS re-release of Cinderella; the Disney Channel ran a television special
      on the making of Toy Story; Walt Disney World in Florida held a daily Toy Story
      parade at Disney-MGM Studios.[65]

      It was screenwriter Joss Whedon s idea to incorporate Barbie as a character
      who could rescue Woody and Buzz in the film s final act.[76] The idea was dropped
      after Mattel objected and refused to license the toy. Producer Ralph Guggenheim
      claimed that Mattel did not allow the use of the toy as  They [Mattel] philosophically
      felt girls who play with Barbie dolls are projecting their personalities onto
      the doll. If you give the doll a voice and animate it, you re creating a persona
      for it that might not be every little girl s dream and desire. [38] Hasbro likewise
      refused to license G.I. Joe (mainly because Sid was going to blow one up, prompting
      the filmmakers to instead use a fictional toy, Combat Carl), but they did license
      Mr. Potato Head.[38] The only toy in the movie that was not in production was
      Slinky Dog, which had been discontinued since the 1970s. When designs for Slinky
      were sent to Betty James (Richard James s wife) she said that Pixar had improved
      the toy and that it was  cuter  than the original.[77]

      3-D re-release

      On October 2, 2009, the film was re-released in Disney Digital 3-D.[78] The
      film was also released with Toy Story 2 as a double feature for a two-week run[79]
      which was extended due to its success.[80] In addition, the film s second sequel,
      Toy Story 3, was also released in the 3-D format.[78] Lasseter commented on
      the new 3-D re-release:

      The Toy Story films and characters will always hold a very special place in
      our hearts and we re so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences
      to enjoy in a whole new way thanks to the latest in 3-D technology. With Toy
      Story 3 shaping up to be another great adventure for Buzz, Woody and the gang
      from Andy s room, we thought it would be great to let audiences experience the
      first two films all over again and in a brand new way.[81]

      Translating the film into 3-D involved revisiting the original computer data
      and virtually placing a second camera into each scene, creating left eye and
      right eye views needed to achieve the perception of depth.[82] Unique to computer
      animation, Lasseter referred to this process as  digital archaeology. [82] The
      process took four months, as well as an additional six months for the two films
      to add the 3-D. The lead stereographer Bob Whitehill oversaw this process and
      sought to achieve an effect that affected the emotional storytelling of the
      film:

      When I would look at the films as a whole, I would search for story reasons
      to use 3-D in different ways. In Toy Story, for instance, when the toys were
      alone in their world, I wanted it to feel consistent to a safer world. And when
      they went out to the human world, that s when I really blew out the 3-D to make
      it feel dangerous and deep and overwhelming.[82]

      Unlike other countries, the United Kingdom received the films in 3-D as separate
      releases. Toy Story was released on October 2, 2009. Toy Story 2 was instead
      released January 22, 2010.[83] The re-release performed well at the box office,
      opening with $12,500,000 in its opening weekend, placing at the third position
      after Zombieland and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.[84] The double feature
      grossed $30.7 million in its five-week release.[84]

      Toy Story was released by Walt Disney Home Video on VHS and LaserDisc on October
      29, 1996, with no bonus material. In the first week of this release, VHS rentals
      totaled $5.1 million, debuting Toy Story as the week s No. 1 video.[85] Over
      21.5 million VHS copies were sold the first year.[86] A deluxe edition widescreen
      LaserDisc 4-disc box set was released on December 18, 1996. On January 11, 2000,
      the film was re-released on VHS, but this time as the first video to be part
      of the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection with the bonus short film Tin Toy.
      This release sold two million copies.[86]

      The film was released for the first time on DVD on October 17, 2000, in a two-pack
      with its first sequel Toy Story 2. The same day, a 3-disc  Ultimate Toy Box  set
      was released, featuring Toy Story, Toy Story 2, and a third disc of bonus materials
      with Toy Story in a 35 mm Widescreen print and Toy Story 2 only being in FullScreen.[86]
      The twin-pack release was later released individually on March 20, 2001 with
      the film available in both Widescreen and FullScreen. The DVD-pack, U.T.B. set
      and the original DVD use the 35 mm print of the film to create the copies, rather
      than using the original files to encode the movie directly to video. The DVD
      two-pack, the Ultimate Toy Box set, the Gold Classic Collection VHS and DVD,
      and the original DVD were all put in the Disney Vault on May 1, 2003. On September
      6, 2005, a 2-disc  10th Anniversary Edition  was released featuring much of
      the bonus material from the  Ultimate Toy Box , including a retrospective special
      with John Lasseter, a home theater mix, as well as a new digital Widescreen
      picture with the 35 mm Fullscreen version being retained.[87] This DVD went
      back in the Disney Vault on January 31, 2009 along with Toy Story 2. The 10th
      Anniversary release was the last version of Toy Story to be released before
      taken out of the Disney Vault lineup along with Toy Story 2. Also on September
      6, 2005, a UMD of Toy Story featuring some deleted scenes, a filmmakers  reflect
      and a new  Legacy of Toy Story  was released for the Sony PlayStation Portable.

      The film was available for the first time on Blu-ray in a Special Edition Combo
      Pack that included two discs, the Blu-ray, and the DVD versions of the film.
      This combo-edition was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on
      March 23, 2010, along with its sequel.[88] There was a DVD-only re-release on
      May 11, 2010.[89] Another  Ultimate Toy Box , packaging the Combo Pack with
      those of both sequels, became available on November 2, 2010. On November 1,
      2011, the first three Toy Story films were re-released all together, each as
      a DVD/Blu-ray/Blu-ray 3D/Digital Copy combo pack (four discs each for the first
      two films, and five for the third film). They were also released on Blu-ray
      3D in a complete trilogy box set. Toy Story was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray on
      June 4, 2019.[90]

      Yes, we worry about what the critics say. Yes, we worry about what the opening
      box office is going to be. Yes, we worry about what the final box office is
      going to be. But really, the whole point why we do what we do is to entertain
      our audiences. The greatest joy I get as a filmmaker is to slip into an audience
      for one of our movies anonymously and watch people watch our film. Because people
      are 100 percent honest when they re watching a movie. And to see the joy on
      people s faces, to see people really get into our films... to me is the greatest
      reward I could possibly get.

      —John Lasseter, reflecting on the impact of the film[91]

      Toy Story received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval
      rating of 100% based on 89 reviews, with an average rating of 9.01/10. The website
      s critical consensus reads,  Entertaining as it is innovative, Toy Story reinvigorated
      animation while heralding the arrival of Pixar as a family-friendly force to
      be reckoned with. [92] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 95 out of 100,
      based on 26 reviews, indicating  universal acclaim .[93] Audiences polled by
      CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of  A  on an A+ to F scale.[94]

      Leonard Klady of Variety commended the animation s  ... razzle-dazzle technique
      and unusual look  and that  the camera loops and zooms in a dizzying fashion
      that fairly takes one s breath away. [95] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times
      compared the film s innovative animation to Disney s Who Framed Roger Rabbit,
      saying that  both movies take apart the universe of cinematic visuals and put
      it back together again, allowing us to see in a new way. [96] Due to the film
      s creative animation, Richard Corliss of TIME claimed that it was  ... the year
      s most inventive comedy. [97]

      The voice cast was also praised by various critics. Susan Wloszczyna of USA
      Today approved of the selection of Hanks and Allen for the lead roles.[98] Kenneth
      Turan of the Los Angeles Times stated that  Starting with Tom Hanks, who brings
      an invaluable heft and believability to Woody, Toy Story is one of the best
      voiced animated features in memory, with all the actors ... making their presences
      strongly felt. [99] Several critics also recognized the film s ability to appeal
      to various age groups, specifically children and adults.[96][100] Owen Gleiberman
      of Entertainment Weekly wrote  It has the purity, the ecstatic freedom of imagination,
      that s the hallmark of the greatest children s films. It also has the kind of
      spring-loaded allusive prankishness that, at times, will tickle adults even
      more than it does kids. [101]

      In 1995, Toy Story was ranked eighth in TIME s list of the  Best 10 films of
      1995 .[102] In 2011, TIME named it one of the  25 All-TIME Best Animated Films
      .[103] It also ranks at number 99 in Empire magazine s list of the  500 Greatest
      Films of All Time  and as the  highest-ranked animated movie .[104]

      In 2003, the Online Film Critics Society ranked the film as the greatest animated
      film of all time.[105] In 2007, the Visual Effects Society named the film 22nd
      in its list of the  Top 50 Most Influential Visual Effects Films of All Time
      .[106] The film is ranked 99th on the AFI s list of the  100 greatest American
      Films of All-Time .[107][108][109] It was one of the only two animated films
      on that list, the other being Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). It was
      also the sixth best in the animation genre on AFI s 10 Top 10.

      Director Terry Gilliam praised the film as  a work of genius. It got people
      to understand what toys are about. They re true to their own character. And
      that s just brilliant. It s got a shot that s always stuck with me, when Buzz
      Lightyear discovers he s a toy. He s sitting on this landing at the top of the
      staircase and the camera pulls back and he s this tiny little figure. He was
      this guy with a massive ego two seconds before... and it s stunning. I d put
      that as one of my top ten films, period. [110]

      Before the film s release, executive producer and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve
      Jobs stated  If Toy Story is a modest hit—say $75 million at the box office,
      we ll [Pixar and Disney] both break even. If it gets $100 million, we ll both
      make money. But if it s a real blockbuster and earns $200 million or so at the
      box office, we ll make good money, and Disney will make a lot of money.  Upon
      its release on November 22, 1995, Toy Story managed to gross more than $350
      million worldwide.[64] Disney chairman Michael Eisner stated  I don t think
      either side thought Toy Story would turn out as well as it has. The technology
      is brilliant, the casting is inspired, and I think the story will touch a nerve.
      Believe me, when we first agreed to work together, we never thought their first
      movie would be our 1995 holiday feature, or that they could go public on the
      strength of it. [64] The film s first five days of domestic release (on Thanksgiving
      weekend) earned it $39,071,176.[111] The film placed first in the weekend s
      box office with $29.1 million[3] and maintained the number-one position at the
      domestic box office for the next two weekends. Toy Story became the highest-grossing
      domestic film of 1995, beating Batman Forever, Apollo 13 (also starring Tom
      Hanks), Pocahontas, Casper, Waterworld, and GoldenEye.[112] At the time of its
      release, it was the third-highest-grossing animated film of all time, after
      The Lion King (1994) and Aladdin (1992).[23] When not considering inflation,
      Toy Story is number 96 on the list of the highest-grossing domestic films of
      all time.[113] The film had gross receipts of $191.8 million in the U.S. and
      Canada and $181.8 million in international markets for a total of $373.6 million
      worldwide.[3] At the time of its release, the film ranked as the 17th-highest-grossing
      film (unadjusted) domestically and the 21st-highest-grossing film worldwide.

      Lasseter with the Special Achievement Oscar

      The film won and was nominated for various other awards including a Kids  Choice
      Award, MTV Movie Award, and a British Academy Film Award, among others. John
      Lasseter received an Academy Special Achievement Award in 1996  for the development
      and inspired application of techniques that have made possible the first feature-length
      computer-animated film. [114][115] Additionally, the film was nominated for
      three Academy Awards, two to Randy Newman for Best Music—Original Song, for  You
      ve Got a Friend in Me , and Best Music—Original Musical or Comedy Score.[116]
      It was also nominated for Best Original Screenplay for the work by Joel Cohen,
      Pete Docter, John Lasseter, Joe Ranft, Alec Sokolow, Andrew Stanton and Joss
      Whedon, making Toy Story the first animated film to be nominated for an Academy
      Award writing category.[116]

      Toy Story won eight Annie Awards, including  Best Animated Feature . Animator
      Pete Docter, director John Lasseter, musician Randy Newman, producers Bonnie
      Arnold and Ralph Guggenheim, production designer Ralph Eggleston, and writers
      Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow, Andrew Stanton, and Joss Whedon all won awards for  Best
      Individual Achievement  in their respective fields for their work on the film.
      The film also won  Best Individual Achievement  in technical achievement.[117]

      Toy Story was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards, one for Best Motion Picture—Comedy
      or Musical, and one for Best Original Song—Motion Picture for Newman s  You
      ve Got a Friend in Me .[118] At both the Los Angeles Film Critics Association
      Awards and the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards, the film won  Best Animated
      Film .[119][120] Toy Story is also among the top ten in the BFI list of the
      50 films you should see by the age of 14,[121][122] and the highest-placed (at
      No. 99) animated film in Empire magazine s list of  500 Greatest Movie of All
      Time .[123] In 2005, Toy Story, along with Toy Story 2 was voted the 4th greatest
      cartoon in Channel 4 s 100 Greatest Cartoons poll, behind The Simpsons, Tom
      and Jerry, and South Park.[124]

      Toy Story had a large impact on the film industry with its innovative computer
      animation. After the film s debut, various industries were interested in the
      technology used for the film. Graphics chip makers desired to compute imagery
      similar to the film s animation for personal computers; game developers wanted
      to learn how to replicate the animation for video games; and robotics researchers
      were interested in building artificial intelligence into their machines that
      compared to the film s lifelike characters.[125] Various authors have also compared
      the film to an interpretation of Don Quixote as well as humanism.[126][127]
      In addition, Toy Story left an impact with its catchphrase  To Infinity and
      Beyond , sequels, and software, among others. In 2005 (10 years after its theatrical
      release), the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry
      by the United States Library of Congress, one of only six films to be selected
      in its first year of eligibility.[128]

      Buzz Lightyear s classic line  To Infinity and Beyond  has seen usage not only
      on themed merchandise, but among philosophers and mathematical theorists as
      well.[129][130][131] In 2008, during STS-124 astronauts took an action figure
      of Buzz Lightyear into space on the Discovery Space Shuttle as part of an educational
      experience for students while stressing the catchphrase. The action figure was
      used for experiments in zero-g.[132] It was reported in 2008 that a father and
      son had continually repeated the phrase to help them keep track of each other
      while treading water for 15 hours in the Atlantic Ocean.[133] The phrase occurs
      in the lyrics of Beyoncé s 2008 song  Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It) , during
      the bridge.[134] In 2012, the late Capital STEEZ released a song titled  Infinity
      and Beyond  in reference to the phrase as part of his AmeriKKKan Korruption
      mixtape.[135]

      Expanded franchise

      Main article: Toy Story (franchise)

      Toy Story has spawned three sequels: Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010),
      and Toy Story 4 (2019). Initially, the first sequel to Toy Story was going to
      be a direct-to-video release, with development beginning in 1996.[136] However,
      after the cast from Toy Story returned and the story was considered to be better
      than that of a direct-to-video release, it was announced in 1998 that the sequel
      would see a theatrical release.[137]

      Toy Story 2 was released to theaters November 24, 1999 and saw the return of
      the majority of the voice cast from the first film. The sequel focuses on Buzz
      leading Andy s toys on a mission to rescue Woody after he is stolen by a greedy
      toy collector. The film was equally well received by critics, many of whom thought
      it was even better than the first installment, earning a rare 100% approval
      rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 163 reviews.[138] At Metacritic, the film
      earned a favorable rating of 88/100 based on 34 reviews.[139] The film s widest
      release was 3,257 theaters and it grossed $497 million worldwide, becoming the
      second-most successful animated film after The Lion King at the time of its
      release.[140][141]

      Toy Story 3 was released to theaters June 18, 2010 and centers on Andy s mother
      accidentally donating the toys to a day-care center when Andy, now a teenager,
      is preparing to go to college. Once there, they must hurry home before Andy
      leaves.[142][143] Again, the majority of the cast from the prior two films returned,
      with Slinky Dog voiced by Blake Clark due to Jim Varney s death in 2000. It
      was the first film in the franchise to be released in 3-D for its first run,
      though the first two films, which were originally released in 2-D, were re-released
      in 3-D in 2009 as a double feature.[142] Like its predecessors, Toy Story 3
      received enormous critical acclaim, earning a 98% approval rating from Rotten
      Tomatoes.[144] It also grossed more than $1 billion worldwide, making it the
      highest-grossing animated film until the release of 2013 s Frozen.[145]

      Toy Story 4 was released theatrically on June 21, 2019[8][9] and centers on
      Woody reuniting with Bo Peep, who was given away by Andy s mother years ago,
      while also coming to terms with his own continued purpose as a toy. It was originally
      set to be directed by John Lasseter and co-directed by Josh Cooley, but Lasseter
      stepped down in July 2017, leaving Cooley as the sole director.[146] Most of
      the cast of the previous films again reprised their character roles, with Mr.
      Potato Head voiced through archive recordings due to Don Rickles  death in 2017.[147]

      In November 1996, the Disney on Ice: Toy Story ice show opened which featured
      the cast s voices as well as Randy Newman s music.[148] In April 2008, the Disney
      Wonder cruise ship launched Toy Story: The Musical shows on its cruises.[149]

      Toy Story also led to a spin-off direct-to-video animated film, Buzz Lightyear
      of Star Command: The Adventure Begins, as well as the animated television series
      Buzz Lightyear of Star Command.[150] The film and series followed Buzz Lightyear
      and his friends at Star Command as they uphold justice across the galaxy. Although
      the film was criticized for not using the same animation as the Toy Story films,
      it sold three million VHS and DVDs in its first week of release.[151][152] The
      television series brought further commercial and critical acclaim, winning a
      Daytime Emmy in 2001 for Outstanding Sound Editing. The series ran for a total
      of 65 episodes.[citation needed]

      Following the release of Toy Story 3, a series of Toy Story short films have
      been shown in theaters in front of other Disney features: Hawaiian Vacation
      (shown before Cars 2), centering on Barbie and Ken on vacation in Bonnie s room,
      Small Fry (shown before The Muppets), centering on Buzz being left in a fast-food
      restaurant, and Partysaurus Rex (shown before the 3D re-release of Finding Nemo),
      centering on Rex partying with bath toys.[citation needed]

      In January 2013, a fan-made live-action version of the film was posted on YouTube
      that received more than 20 million views before being taken down by Disney for
      copyright of the audio.[153][154][155] In February 2016, the video returned
      to YouTube.[156]

      In October 2013, ABC aired Toy Story of Terror!, promoting it as Pixar s first
      television special.[157] In the special, Mr. Potato Head disappears and the
      other toys have to find him.[citation needed]

      On December 2, 2014, ABC aired Toy Story That Time Forgot. In the story, the
      toys are trapped in room with a group of humanoid dinosaur warrior toys called
      Battlesaurs who do not know that they are toys and must escape.[158]

      Software and merchandise

      Disney s Animated Storybook: Toy Story and Disney s Activity Center: Toy Story
      were released for Windows and Mac OS.[159] Disney s Animated Storybook: Toy
      Story was the best selling software title of 1996, selling over 500,000 copies.[160]
      Two console video games were released for the film: the Toy Story video game,
      for the Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy, and PC
      as well as Toy Story Racer, for the PlayStation (which contains elements from
      Toy Story 2).[161] Pixar created original animations for all of the games, including
      fully animated sequences for the PC titles.[citation needed]

      Toy Story had a large promotion before its release, leading to numerous tie-ins
      with the film including images on food packaging.[74] A variety of merchandise
      was released during the film s theatrical run and its initial VHS release including
      toys, clothing, and shoes, among other things.[162] When an action figure for
      Buzz Lightyear and Sheriff Woody was created it was initially ignored by retailers.
      However, after over 250,000 figures were sold for each character before the
      film s release, demand continued to expand, eventually reaching over 25 million
      units sold by 2007.[91]

      Toy Story and its sequels have inspired multiple attractions at the theme parks
      of Walt Disney World and Disneyland:

      Buzz Lightyear s Space Ranger Spin at the Magic Kingdom casts theme park guests
      as cadets in Buzz s Space Ranger Corps. Guests ride through various scenes featuring
      Emperor Zurg s henchmen, firing  laser cannons  at their Z symbols, scoring
      points for each hit.[163]

      Buzz Lightyear s Astro Blasters at Disneyland is similar to Space Ranger Spin,
      except that the laser cannons are hand-held rather than mounted to the ride
      vehicle.[164]

      Buzz Lightyear s Astro Blasters at Walt Disney World s DisneyQuest, despite
      the identical name to the Disneyland attraction, is a bumper car style attraction
      in which guests compete against each other not only by ramming their ride vehicles
      into each other but also by firing  asteroids  (playground balls) at each other.[165]

      Toy Story Midway Mania! at both Walt Disney World s Disney s Hollywood Studios
      and Disneyland s Disney California Adventure features a series of interactive
      carnival-type games hosted by the Toy Story characters. Guests ride in vehicles
      while wearing 3-D glasses, and using a pull-string cannon to launch virtual
      rings, darts, baseballs, etc. Disney announced an update to the attraction to
      add characters from Toy Story 3 several months before the film s release date.[166][167]

      World of Color at Disney California Adventure is a large nighttime water and
      light show. Some of the scenes projected on the water screens feature animation
      from the Toy Story films.[168]

      Toy Story Playland at Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland, opened in August
      2010 and November 2011 respectively. The area is designed to create the illusion
      of  shrinking the guest  down to the size of a toy, and to play in Andy s backyard
      in several themed rides.[169]

      Toy Story Land opened at Disney s Hollywood Studios on June 30, 2018, with rides
      including the Slinky Dog Dash and Alien Swirling Saucers.[170]

      Toy Story s cast of characters forms the basis for the naming of the releases
      of the Debian computer operating system, from Debian 1.1 Buzz, the first release
      with a codename, in 1996, to Debian 11 Bullseye, the most-recently announced
      future release.[171][172]

      In 2013, Pixar designed a  Gromit Lightyear  sculpture based on the Aardman
      Animations character Gromit for Gromit Unleashed which sold for £65,000.[173]

      Q: Is  Toy Story  based on a book?

      Every Kid s Fantasy

      3 February 2009 | by alexkolokotronis – See all my reviews

      Toy Story is the film that started Pixar Animated Studios into its long string
      of never ending success. What Pixar does is not just absorb the younger demographic
      and keep the older ones mildly entertained. It completely absorbs everyone watching
      no matter the age or the level of maturity, films of Pixar, starting from Toy
      Story, have kept a certain magical touch around it with an unexpected amount
      of depth. Everyone as a child imagines their toys will come alive and go on
      their own adventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does not
      attract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather with its material.
      The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned
      voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting
      for animated films as there is to a live-action one. As a result of this Pixar
      stays faithful to its material and creates a great genuine and warm feeling
      around the film and its characters.'

    - 'Pixar Animation Studios Licenses NVIDIA Technology for Accelerating Feature
      Film Production

      SANTA CLARA, CA - To accelerate production of its computer-animated feature
      films and short film content, Pixar Animation Studios is licensing a suite of
      NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) technologies related to image rendering, the companies
      announced today.

      The multi-year strategic licensing agreement gives Pixar access to NVIDIA s
      quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) rendering methods. These methods can make rendering
      more efficient, especially when powered by GPUs and other massively parallel
      computing architectures.

      NVIDIA and Pixar have worked together for years to improve workflows in content
      creation,  said Steven Parker, vice president of engineering and CTO of rendering
      technology at NVIDIA.  With NVIDIA s QMC sampling technology, Pixar can accelerate
      its creative process while continuing to produce visual imagery and animation
      of the very highest standard.

      Pixar has long used NVIDIA GPU technology to push the limits of what is possible
      in animation and the filmmaking process,  said Steve May, vice president and
      CTO at Pixar.  NVIDIA s particular QMC implementation has the potential to enhance
      rendering functionality and significantly reduce our rendering times.

      As part of the agreement, NVIDIA will also contribute ray-tracing technology
      to Pixar s OpenSubdiv Project, an open-source initiative to promote high-performance
      subdivision surface evaluation on massively parallel CPU and GPU architectures.
      This will enable rendering of complex Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces in
      animation with unprecedented precision.

    - "Pixar Animation Studios: Creative Kaizen\nBy HBSstudent11\nIliad S.A.: the\
      \ story behind France’s telecommunications maverick\nHow Pixar’s innovative\
      \ production process ensures creative quality for audiences\nPixar: A Winner\n\
      Pixar has been highly effective at aligning its business and operating models\
      \ to drive success. Founded 1986, Pixar has produced 16 feature animated films\
      \ which together have grossed almost $4 billion at the box office (1). Critically\
      \ acclaimed projects include: Toy Story, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, Up, and\
      \ Finding Nemo. Disney took notice of Pixar’s ability to churn out blockbusters,\
      \ and acquired them in 2006 (2). This ability seems to be driven by Pixar’s\
      \ unique model of organization, production, and talent retention.\nPixar makes\
      \ money by unifying art and technology to produce original animated films that\
      \ motivate audiences to buy movie tickets, DVDs, digital copies, and merchandise.\
      \ These films are marketed towards children, but have the emotional depth and\
      \ production quality to appeal to adults. Pixar’s key market differentiator\
      \ is its focus on quality. Instead of throwing out a portfolio of movies every\
      \ year and hoping that a few become blockbusters, Pixar makes big bets on a\
      \ fewer number of films, producing one film every four to five years. It minimizes\
      \ risk by ensuring the quality of these films via a highly monitored production\
      \ process.\nPixar has a very unique operating model compared to other film studios.\
      \ In other studios, new creative teams are formed around new film concepts and\
      \ then disbanded once the films are complete. Pixar takes a drastically different\
      \ approach and retains creative talent as long-term employees. This allows teams\
      \ to improve their skills and operating processes over time with increased repetition\
      \ (3). Pixar leaders believe that the initial idea matters a lot less than the\
      \ people who actually iterate and brainstorm around that idea throughout the\
      \ production process (4). Other key elements of Pixar’s successful operating\
      \ model include:\nIncubator Teams: When concepts are still nascent, small teams\
      \ of directors, writers, and artists serve as incubators that work together\
      \ to improve and expand on the initial ideas. This tests the idea, but also\
      \ serves as a way for teams to feel out their strengths and weaknesses and learn\
      \ how they should work together moving forward (4).\nShared Dailies: Every day,\
      \ directors and producers must show their daily work to everyone (instead of\
      \ just a small team like at other studios). All members of the crew are encouraged\
      \ to offer suggestions for improvement. Dailies serve as a great way to share\
      \ information with the entire team and break down departmental barriers (4).\n\
      Creative Brain Trust: This is a committee of creative leaders in the company\
      \ that directors/producers can access to help solve production problems. An\
      \ important and unique dynamic of this group is that, unlike traditional studio\
      \ development executives, the advisors of this committee have no authority.\
      \ Instead, they are peers whose purpose is solely to offer creative input and\
      \ advice (5).\nPostmortems: These are meetings that occur after a film is finished\
      \ and discuss the successes and failures of the process. This is critical for\
      \ the growth of the teams (as they will largely remain together to work on the\
      \ next Pixar film) and helps improve work output and processes for the future\
      \ (4).\nPixar University: The company offers classes across disciplines to foster\
      \ communication between departments and emphasize the idea of “learning and\
      \ growing together” (3).\nPixar Campus: The campus has an open plan that maximizes\
      \ interaction among colleagues during the workday to stimulate conversation\
      \ and free flow of ideas (3).\nBusiness and Operating Model Alignment\nThe business\
      \ and operating models are both aligned on Pixar’s key competitive advantages:\
      \ creativity and quality. Pixar has become a consumer-facing brand associated\
      \ with a high level of creativity and quality — and they want to sustain this\
      \ brand identity to retain loyal audiences. To ensure that this production value\
      \ is being provided to customers, the production process is highly detail-oriented\
      \ and based on constant iteration, refinement, and team growth and learning.\
      \ A Harvard Business Review article even likened Pixar’s continuous improvement\
      \ model to that of Toyota’s “Kaizen” philosophy (6). The operating model also\
      \ supports the business model and decreases the risk of a very expensive film\
      \ failure by subjecting the work in process to constant quality control checks.\
      \ High levels of cooperation and sharing throughout the production process allows\
      \ for errors in storyline, dialogue, or visual effects to be caught early and\
      \ often — before the process is too far along for these problems to be fixed\
      \ (4). Though this increases the cycle time of the process (often only 2 seconds\
      \ of a film is worked on each day!), Pixar’s box office performance has shown\
      \ that the value gained from this process in quality and creativity added has\

      Buzz Lightyear, I am your biggest fan!!! Nice post. Very interesting comparing\
      \ their operating model vs. the rest of Hollywood. I would imagine the reason\
      \ may be related to the criticality of software in teh production process… the\
      \ interface between creative and technical is much more integrative, which may\
      \ motivate keeping people aroudn to drive experience and learning in the more\
      \ complex setting… what do you think?\nDecember 14, 2015\t Buzz Lightyear says:\n\
      I think that the technology/software side of Pixar does have something to do\
      \ with it. Their approach often comes across as more scientific than artistic\
      \ to me. For example, they encourage their tech artists to regularly publish\
      \ articles and present at conferences so that they maintain a strong relationship\
      \ with the academic community.\nIt is interesting to note, however, that elsewhere\
      \ in Hollywood, smaller-scale creative alliances do form. For example, director\
      \ David O. Russell and actress Jennifer Lawrence have worked on multiple movies\
      \ such as Joy, American Hustle, and Silver Linings Playbook together. I also\
      \ saw JJ Abram’s long-time editors (since the show Alias) speak at the LA Film\
      \ Festival this summer, and they said have gotten to know his working style\
      \ over the years, and it seemed like they have refined and improved their working\
      \ processes over time. I am working in development at a production company this\
      \ summer, and hope to learn more about the different operating models happening\
      \ in film/TV and how creative teams form and function!\nhttp://www.filmindependent.org/blogs/j-j-abrams-long-time-editors-reveal-how-to-help-develop-characters-in-the-editing-room/#.Vm9jOxorLUo\n\

      December 14, 2015\t Lior says:\nI’m also a huge Pixar fan and appreciate how\
      \ they managed to create and sustain such a strong operating model (with clear\
      \ link to the business model – quality and creativity). We actually tried mimicking\
      \ this model as we evaluated marketing campaigns in P&G (we formed a community\
      \ of brain trust and made sure to share campaign progress with the entire team.\
      \ We also discussed the successes and failures of the process at the end of\
      \ the campaign). I personally think the idea of using Pixar model to build marketing\
      \ campaigns is a powerful one, but we lacked full commitment to the process.\n\
      Building on that… I was wondering what are your thoughts on using this model\
      \ for different industries? For example, the pharmaceutical industry would also\
      \ benefit from high quality “blockbuster” drugs as opposed to “mini-hits”.\n\
      This is very interesting. To be honest I didn’t know Pixar had a significantly\
      \ different positioning to other movie producers, but I did love most of their\
      \ movies. The different areas you described reminded me a lot the Design Thinking\
      \ process we learned in the IDEO case, with teams brainstorming and converging\
      \ during the day and then use the Incubator Team, Shared Dailies and the Creative\
      \ Brain Trust to validate and/or generate new ideas. I wonder whether they do\

      \ if Pixar was able to keep its unique culture after the Disney buyout. Disney\
      \ has such a strong culture itself, that I would imagined that it would be hard\
      \ for Disney’s culture to not suffocate Pixar’s culture.\nAlso, Shared Dailies\
      \ sound freighting like Bridgewater’s immediate feedback model to me. I wonder\

      —John Lasseter, co-founder of Pixar

      Where story is king.

      —Company motto

      Pixar Animation Studios, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company,
      is an Academy Award-winning film studio with world-renowned technical, creative
      and production capabilities in the art of computer animation and creators of
      some of the most successful and beloved animated films of all time. Pixar has
      so far produced twenty feature films: Toy Story, A Bug s Life, Toy Story 2,
      Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Cars, Ratatouille, WALL•E, Up,
      Toy Story 3, Cars 2, Brave, Monsters University, Inside Out, The Good Dinosaur,
      Finding Dory, Cars 3, Coco and Incredibles 2.

      Pixar s climb to the pinnacle of computer animation success was a quick one
      and the company continues to push the envelope in its art and technology inspired
      film-making endeavors.

      1979-85: Origins

      Pixar s tenuous evolution began in the 1970s when millionaire Alexander Schare,
      then-president of the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT), was looking for
      someone to create an animated film from a sound recording of Tubby the Tuba.
      Enter a computer scientist named Ed Catmull with a Ph.D. from the University
      of Utah, who along with several others set up house at Schare s expense at NYIT
      s Long Island campus to work with computer graphics. Though Tubby the Tuba was
      never made, the team successfully produced video artwork. When creative mogul
      George Lucas proposed moving the team to the West Coast in 1979 as part of Lucasfilm
      Ltd., the breeding ground of the original Star Wars trilogy, Catmull and his
      colleagues agreed.

      Over the next few years, Catmull and his ensemble created innovative graphics
      programs and equipment for Lucas, including an imaging computer called the  Pixar.  The
      Pixar was then used to develop high-tech graphics and animation sequences for
      Lucasfilm projects. Unlike other computers, Pixar s software constructed high-resolution,
      three-dimensional color images of virtually anything, from buildings and cars
      to tornadoes and aliens. Remarkably, Pixar was also capable of helping medical
      professionals at Johns Hopkins diagnose diseases from 3D renderings of CAT-scans
      and x-rays, giving weather technicians new images from satellites, and even
      helping prospectors locate oil from enhanced seismic readings--all at a speed
      some 200 times faster than previous computer programs.

      In 1984, John Lasseter, who had met Catmull at a computer graphics conference
      and was employed by Walt Disney Studios, visited Lucasfilm for a month-long
      stint. Lasseter, who had graduated from the California Institute of the Arts
      where he had won two Student Academy Awards for animated film, decided to stay.
      Meanwhile, after spinning off a joint venture called Droid Works, George Lucas
      started shopping around Pixar with hopes of a second spinoff. Pixar caught the
      interest of several companies, including EDS, then a division of General Motors,
      Philips N.V., and computer whiz-kid Steve Jobs, cofounder and chairman of Apple
      Computer Inc. Unable to convince Apple s board of directors to invest in or
      purchase the fledgling graphics company, Jobs reluctantly abandoned his hopes
      for Pixar.

      Yet circumstances changed drastically for Jobs in 1985. Stripped of his responsibilities
      and deposed from his Apple kingdom at about the same time the first Pixar computer
      went on the market for $105,000, Jobs sold the majority of his Apple stock and
      started over. Plunging $12 million into a new computer enterprise named NeXT
      Inc., specializing in personal computers for colleges and universities, Jobs
      approached Lucas in 1986 and paid $10 million for the San Rafael-based Pixar
      and created an independent company. Though Catmull, Lasseter, and crew regarded
      Jobs as kin in their quest for high-tech fun and games given his laidback reputation
      and status as a computer wonder boy--the new boss instructed them to put aside
      their dreams of animation and film and to instead concentrate on technical graphics
      they could sell.

      1986-1991: Highs and Lows

      “ If I knew in 1986 how much it was going to cost to keep Pixar going, I doubt
      if I would ve bought the company!  The problem was, for many years the cost
      of the computers required to make animation we could sell was tremendously high.
      ”

      Luckily, Pixar s crew came up with several software innovations, which they
      used to create a myriad of products. In 1986 came the first of many Oscar nominations
      from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for a short animated film
      called Luxo, Jr. Following this was Red s Dream in 1987, then the development
      of RenderMan, for which the company applied for and received a patent. A revolutionary
      graphics program that allowed computer artists to add color and create texture
      to onscreen 3D objects, RenderMan produced stunningly realistic photo images
      almost indistinguishable from actual photographs. RenderMan s brand of images
      paid off when Tin Toy, written and directed by Lasseter as the first computer-generated
      animation, won an Academy Award as Best Animated Short Film in 1988.

      As CEO of Pixar, Jobs expanded the company s leading edge graphics and animation
      capabilities by joining forces in July 1989 with the San Francisco-based Colossal
      Pictures, a live action, animation, and special effects studio, for collaboration
      purposes and to broker Pixar for television commercials and promotional films.
      With Colossal s background and experience in broadcast media and Pixar s unique
      computer capabilities, the partnership was poised for tremendous success. By
      1990 when more than a dozen RenderMan products were introduced, RenderMan licensing
      fees finally began to pay off. Not only were many hardware and software packagers
      incorporating the graphics program into their products, but RenderMan was endorsed
      by such industry heavyweights as Digital Equipment, IBM, Intel Corporation,
      and Sun Microsystems. In addition, Pixar created two commercials in its association
      with Colossal. The second commercial, for Life Savers  Holes  bite-size candies
      (which took 12 weeks to produce using RenderMan s software), aired in March
      and was a hit with audiences.

      In April 1990, Pixar signed a letter of intent to sell its valuable yet stagnating
      hardware operations, including all proprietary hardware technology and imaging
      software, to Vicom Systems of Fremont, California. The move, which included
      the transfer of 18 of Pixar s 100 employees, was finalized several weeks later
      and allowed Pixar to devote the company s full energy to further development
      of its rendering capabilities. Before the end of the year, Pixar moved from
      San Rafael to new $15 million digs in the Point Richmond Tech Center of Richmond,
      California, and reached revenues of just under $3.4 million, though still not
      reporting a profit.

      While Jobs s other company, NeXT Inc., seemed to prosper and was expected to
      reach $100 million in computer sales, Pixar still struggled to make ends meet
      in 1991. In February, 30 employees were laid off, including President Charles
      Kolstad. Jobs, sometimes criticized as a mercurial spinmeister with too little
      substance to back up his visions and words, was brought to task in the media
      for the shortcomings of both companies. Yet salvation came to Pixar in the name
      of Toy Story, the first full-length computer-animated feature film, as a collaboration
      between Pixar and Lasseter s old stomping grounds, Walt Disney Studios. Signing
      a contract to produce quality  digital entertainment,  Pixar was responsible
      for the content and animation of three full-length films; Disney provided the
      funding for production and promotional costs, owning the marketing and licensing
      fees of the films and their characters. Though Disney retained the lion s share
      of revenue and profit, Pixar negotiated for a slice of the gross revenues from
      the box office and subsequent video sales. At this juncture, neither Disney
      nor Pixar knew the potential of their alliance--one that proved successful beyond
      their wildest expectations.

      1992-95: Magic & Mastery

      In 1992, the joint project between Pixar and Disney, called CAPS (computer animated
      production system) was another stellar development, winning Pixar s second Academy
      Award (shared with Disney). The following year, Jobs s NeXT Inc., like Pixar
      before it, was forced to lay off workers and sell its hardware division to concentrate
      on software development and applications. Yet 1993 was a banner year for Pixar,
      with RenderMan winning the company s third Academy Award and a Gold Clio (for
      advertising excellence) for the funky animated Listerine  Arrows  commercial.
      The next year, Pixar won its second Gold Clio for the Lifesavers  Conga  commercial,
      a colorful romp with a contagious beat. Despite such heavy accolades from critics
      and peers, Pixar still had not managed a profit since its spinoff in 1986, and
      reported a loss of $2.4 million on revenue of $5.6 million for 1994.

      The following year, in 1995, Pixar was wrapping up its work on Toy Story and
      everyone was anxious for the finished result to hit theaters in November. Tom
      Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, and Annie Potts had signed on to voice major
      characters, and Randy Newman was composing the film s musical score. By the
      end of the third quarter with more than 100,000 copies of RenderMan sold and
      a huge licensing deal with Bill Gates and Microsoft, Pixar announced its first-ever
      profit of $3.1 million on revenues of $10.6 million.

      For Pixar, 1995 was a string of accelerating successes: first came Toy Story
      s pre-Thanksgiving release, grossing over $40 million its first weekend, with
      rave reviews from critics and families alike. Leading box office receipts, both
      Disney and Pixar hoped Toy Story could best Pochahontas s $140 million take
      earlier in the year. Next came Pixar s IPO of 6.9 million shares in November
      on the NASDAQ; the market closed at $22 per share, up from its initial offering
      of $12 to $14 each, giving Pixar a market value of some $800 million. Jobs,
      who since his purchase of Pixar for $10 million had sunk an additional $50 million
      into the enterprise, recouped a handsome paper profit of more than $600 million
      for his 80 percent stake (the shares eventually hit a high of $45.50 on November
      30th).

      Another boon came when Toy Story garnered several award nominations, including
      Randy Newman s score for two Golden Globes and an Oscar; an Oscar for Catmull
      and Thomas Porter, director of effects animation or digital scanning technology;
      and an additional Special Achievement Oscar for Lasseter s writing, direction,
      and technical wizardry for Toy Story.

      1996-99: Lightning Strikes!

      After the release of Toy Story while part of Pixar s crew worked on a CD-ROM
      game of the animated film, others were busy working on several Coca-Cola commercials
      for the Creative Arts Agency, hired by Michael Ovitz. Pixar was also immersed
      in its next Disney film A Bug s Life, which was scheduled for release in two
      years. By February 1996, Toy Story had grossed over $177 million at the box
      office and in March Lasseter attended the Academy Awards to receive his Oscar.
      He brought along Woody and Buzz, who were part of several sketches and fodder
      for running gags during the live telecast. Pixar completed the year with a huge
      leap in revenues, up to $38.2 million (from 1995 s $12.1 million), extraordinary
      net income of $25.3 million, and stock prices hitting a high of $49 per share
      in the fourth quarter.[

      Though it had been said by Bob Bennett of Autodesk, Inc., a client and competitor
      of Pixar, that  Pixar is the best in the world at what it does,  continued advances
      in computer and graphics technology brought considerable competition. Everyone
      it seemed--from Digital Domain and Industrial Light & Magic to Microsoft and
      Silicon Graphics--was trying their hand at graphics software development. After
      the stellar success of Toy Story, all the major motion picture studios were
      creating computerized animation, including DreamWorks SKG, Turner Broadcasting,
      Warner Brothers, and even Disney.

      Other developments surrounded Jobs, as Apple stumbled horribly and the company
      came close to financial ruin. Still attached to the company he had cofounded
      and brought to enormous success, Jobs came to its rescue in 1997 shortly after
      Apple bought his NeXT Inc. Few doubted Jobs s ability to juggle both Pixar and
      Apple, and they were right. Not only did Jobs bring Apple back to the forefront
      of the computer industry with the flashy iMac, but Pixar went on to rule the
      box office with A Bug s Life. During the magic  holiday  window of October,
      November, and December 1997, A Bug s Life was up against four animated films,
      including another insect-related story by Dreamworks SKG, entitled Antz. Dreamworks
      had also released The Prince of Egypt and Nickelodeon brought The Rugrats Movie
      to the big screen as well. Yet Pixar beat the pack and went on to ring up over
      $360 million in worldwide box office receipts, even topping Toy Story.

      Once again Pixar was nominated for and won big at the Academy Awards: two separate
      awards for Scientific and Technical Achievement (for the Marionette 3D Animation
      System, and for digital painting), as well as another for Best Animated Short
      Film (Geri s Game). Pixar also finally received a sizable financial boost in
      1997, as revenues and net income reached $34.7 million and $22.1 million, respectively.
      The box office and critical triumphs of both Toy Story and A Bug s Life also
      brought a new deal with Disney to produce an additional five pictures within
      the next ten years, with both companies as equal partners. The agreement eclipsed
      the previous deal; the former s remaining two films became the first two of
      the new five-picture negotiation. Lastly, Pixar would sell Disney up to five
      percent of its common stock at $15 per share.

      In early 1999 A Bug s Life was released on video and DVD simultaneously and
      Pixar s top guns worked feverishly on the sequel to Toy Story, slated for release
      in November. The sequel was a gamble, since only one animated feature film had
      ever spawned a theater-released follow-up, Disney s The Rescuers Down Under.
      Most sequels or prequels were released directly to video; Pixar was ready to
      buck the trend. Dollars from its venture with Disney continued to slowly trickle
      in and Pixar finished the year with $14.3 million in revenue and net earnings
      of $7.8 million. 1999 also brought more kudos for Pixar: David DiFrancesco won
      the company s ninth Academy Award (for Technical Achievement), Toy Story 2 opened
      in November to sweeping box office dominance (even higher receipts than Star
      Wars: The Phantom Menace s first few weeks of release the year before), and
      the company celebrated its fifth consecutive profitable year, with revenues
      of $121 million and earnings topping $50 million.

      2000-2009: The New Century

      Pixar was as busy as ever in the 21st century: The company was preparing to
      move into its new 225,000-square-foot headquarters in Emeryville, California,
      due for completion in mid-2000 and were hard at work on its next full-length
      animated film in collaboration with Disney. The new feature was scheduled for
      release in 2001, under the working title of  Monsters, Inc.  The company s fifth
      film was tentatively slated for release in 2002, was a top-secret project to
      be directed by [[[Andrew Stanton]], who had worked on both Toy Story and A Bug
      s Life. Despite a slow, financially difficult beginning, Pixar Animation Studios
      had landed on the fast track and was known throughout the world. With its technological
      breakthroughs and brilliantly crafted animated films, the sky was the limit
      in the coming decade and beyond. As stated in its 1996 annual report, Pixar
      succeeded because it was well aware of the pitfalls of film-making:

      “ Though Pixar is the pioneer of computer animation, the essence of our business
      is to create compelling stories and memorable characters. It is chiseled in
      stone at our studios that no amount of technology can turn a bad story into
      a good one. ”

      Monsters, Inc. was followed by Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Cars, Ratatouille,
      WALL•E, and Up, which cemented Pixar s reputation as one of the best-critically
      acclaimed movie studios in history.

      2010-present: To Infinity and Beyond!

      On April 20, 2010, Pixar opened a new studio in the downtown area of Gastown,
      Vancouver, B.C., named Pixar Canada. The studio is primarily creating projects
      featuring characters from Toy Story and Cars. The studio was shut down on October
      8, 2013 to  refocus creative and business efforts and resources under one roof
      [1].

      Pixar released Toy Story 3 on June 18, 2010, which met with universal acclaim
      and box-office success. It made over $1.063B and is the highest grossing animated
      film of all time.

      John Lasseter fueled speculation on Pixar s future sequels when he stated,  If
      we have a great story, we ll do a sequel . Cars 2, Pixar s first sequel not
      based on Toy Story, was released on June 24, 2011. Brave, Pixar s first fairy-tale,
      was released on June 15, 2012. Monsters University, a prequel to Monsters, Inc.
      was also announced on April 22, 2010, for release on June 21, 2013. Three original
      films were announced in early 2012: Inside Out, set to be released on June 19,
      2015, The Good Dinosaur, to be released on November 25, 2015, and Coco. It was
      reported by Comingsoon.net to be released in 2016.[2] A sequel to Finding Nemo,
      titled Finding Dory, was announced in April 2013, for release in 2016.

      According to Disney Vault, at the Hero Complex Film Festival 2012, Stanton says
      he feels that Pixar will continue to make more sequels, which he said:  I’m
      sure you’ll see some other sequels of things as they grow because now we are
      not so blinded. It’s the originals that keep us really going and it’s the sequels
      that are like comfort food, and I think it’s the same way for the audience.

      According to Variety, Derek Connolly and Teddy Newton are working on an untitled
      project.[5] Details are, at this stage, very few, but Connolly tells the trade
      that he s been instructed to write as though he s telling a story for adults
      rather than kids, specifically. It was also announced that Mark Andrews is developing
      another film.[6]

      It was also announced that 3 films will be released from 2017 to 2018.[7][8]
      It is currently unknown what the films are.

      On March 18, 2014 during Disney s annual shareholder meeting, Disney CEO Bob
      Iger announced that Pixar had begun pre-production on Incredibles 2[9] with
      The Incredibles director Brad Bird working on the story.[10]. Iger also announced
      at the time that development had begun on a third Cars film[9].

      On October 8, 2015, Disney and Pixar announced that Cars 3 would be released
      on June 17, 2017. Coco, the final title of Lee Unkrich s film based on the Day
      of the Dead, was dated for November 22, 2017. Toy Story 4 and The Incredibles
      2 were dated for June 15, 2018 and June 21, 2019. Two unknown films from Pixar
      were both announced for 2020 releases on March 13 and June 19.[11] Another unknown
      Pixar film was dated for June 18, 2021.[12]

      On July 14, 2017, during Disney s D23 Expo, Pixar announced an Untitled Suburban
      Fantasy Film to be directed by Dan Scanlon and produced by Kori Rae.[13]

      Since its incorporation, Pixar has been responsible for many important breakthroughs
      in the application of computer graphics (CG) for film-making. Consequently,
      the company has attracted some of the world s finest talent in this area. Pixar
      s technical and creative teams have collaborated since 1986 to develop a wealth
      of production software used in-house to create its movies and further the state
      of the art in CG film making. This proprietary technology allows the production
      of animated images of a quality, richness and vibrancy that are unique in the
      industry, and above all, allows the director to precisely control the end results
      in a way that is exactly right for the story. Pixar continues to invest heavily
      in its software systems and believes that further advancements will lead to
      additional productivity and quality improvements in the making of its computer
      animated films.

      Pixar also has a long standing tradition of sharing its advances within the
      broader CG community, through technical papers, technology partnerships, and
      most notably through its publicly available RenderMan product for the highest-quality,
      photo-realistic images currently available. RenderMan remains the standard in
      CG film visual effects and feature animation and has been honored with an Academy
      Award for technical achievement.

      In 2001, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences  Board of Governors®
      honored Ed Catmull, president of Pixar and Disney Animation Studios, Loren Carpenter,
      senior scientist, and Rob Cook, vice president of software engineering, with
      an Academy Award of Merit (Oscar®)  for significant advancements to the field
      of motion picture rendering as exemplified in Pixar s RenderMan.  In 2002, the
      Producer s Guild of America honored Pixar with the Guild s inaugural Vanguard
      Award, which recognizes outstanding achievement in new media and technology.

      Pixar s creative department is led by Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter,
      an Academy Award®-winning director and animator. Under the guidance of Lasseter,
      Pixar has built a creative team that includes a department of highly skilled
      animators, a story department and an art department. This team is responsible
      for creating, writing, and animating all of Pixar s films. Pixar strives to
      hire animators who have superior acting ability - those able to bring characters
      and inanimate objects to life as though they have their own thought processes.
      In order to attract and retain quality animators, the company founded Pixar
      University, which conducts three-month long courses for new and existing animators.
      Pixar also has a complete production team which gives the company the capability
      to control all elements of production of its films. Pixar has successfully expanded
      the production team so projects may be worked on simultaneously.

      Initially, when Pixar was a high-end computer hardware company whose core product
      was the Pixar Image Computer, a system primarily sold to government agencies
      and the medical community. One of the buyers of Pixar Image Computers was Disney
      Studios, which was using the device as part of their secretive CAPS project,
      using the machine and custom software to migrate the laborious ink and paint
      part of the 2-D animation process to a more automated and thus efficient method.

      Pixar continued its relationship with Walt Disney Feature Animation, a studio
      whose corporate parent would ultimately become its most important partner.

      Pixar and Disney had disagreements after the production of Toy Story 2. Originally
      intended as a straight-to-video release (and thus not part of Pixar s three-picture
      deal), the film was eventually upgraded to a theatrical release during production.
      Pixar demanded the film then be counted toward the three-picture agreement,
      but Disney refused. Pixar s first five feature films have collectively grossed
      more than $2.5 billion, equivalent to the highest per-film average gross in
      the industry. Though profitable for both, Pixar later complained that the arrangement
      was not equitable. Pixar was responsible for creation and production while Disney
      handled marketing and distribution. Profits and production costs were split
      50-50, but Disney exclusively owned all story and sequel rights and also collected
      a distribution fee. The lack of story and sequel rights was perhaps the most
      onerous aspect to Pixar and set the stage for a contentious relationship.

      The two companies attempted to reach a new agreement in early 2004. The new
      deal would be only for distribution, as Pixar intended to control production
      and own the resulting film properties themselves. The company also wanted to
      finance their films on their own and collect 100 percent of the profits, paying
      Disney only the 10 to 15 percent distribution fee. More importantly, as part
      of any distribution agreement with Disney, Pixar demanded control over films
      already in production under their old agreement, including The Incredibles and
      Cars. Disney considered these conditions unacceptable, but Pixar would not concede.

      Disagreements between Steve Jobs and then-Disney Chairman and CEO Michael Eisner
      made the negotiations more difficult than they otherwise might have been. They
      broke down completely in mid-2004, with Jobs declaring that Pixar was actively
      seeking partners other than Disney. Pixar did not enter negotiations with other
      distributors. After a lengthy hiatus, negotiations between the two companies
      resumed following the departure of Eisner from Disney in September 2005. In
      preparation for potential fallout between Pixar and Disney, Jobs announced in
      late 2004 that Pixar would no longer release films at the Disney-dictated November
      time frame, but during the more lucrative early summer months. This would also
      allow Pixar to release DVDs for their major releases during the Christmas shopping
      season. An added benefit of delaying Cars was to extend the time frame remaining
      on the Pixar-Disney contract to see how things would play out between the two
      companies.

      Pending the Disney acquisition of Pixar, the two companies created a distribution
      deal for the intended 2007 release of Ratatouille, in case the acquisition fell
      through, to ensure that this one film would still be released through Disney
      s distribution channels. (In contrast to the earlier Disney / Pixar deal Ratatouille
      was to remain a Pixar property and Disney would have received only a distribution
      fee.) The completion of Disney s Pixar acquisition, however, nullified this
      distribution arrangement

      Disney announced on January 24, 2006 that it had agreed to buy Pixar for approximately
      $7.4 billion in an all-stock deal. Following Pixar shareholder approval, the
      acquisition was completed May 5, 2006. The transaction catapulted Steve Jobs,
      who was the majority shareholder of Pixar with 50.1%, to Disney s largest individual
      shareholder with 7% and a new seat on its board of directors. Jobs  new Disney
      holdings exceed holdings belonging to ex-CEO Michael Eisner, the previous top
      shareholder, who still held 1.7%; and Disney Director Emeritus Roy E. Disney,
      who held almost 1% of the corporation s shares. As part of the deal, Pixar co-founder
      John Lasseter, by then Executive Vice President, became Chief Creative Officer
      (reporting to President and CEO Robert Iger and consulting with Disney Director
      Roy Disney) of both Pixar and the Walt Disney Animation Studios, as well as
      the Principal Creative Adviser at Walt Disney Imagineering, which designs and
      builds the company s theme parks. Catmull retained his position as President
      of Pixar, while also becoming President of Walt Disney Animation Studios, reporting
      to Bob Iger and Dick Cook, chairman of Walt Disney Studio Entertainment. Steve
      Jobs  position as Pixar s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was also removed,
      and instead he took a place on the Disney board of directors. Lasseter and Catmull
      s oversight of both the Disney and Pixar studios did not mean that the two studios
      were merging, however. In fact, additional conditions were laid out as part
      of the deal to ensure that Pixar remained a separate entity, a concern that
      analysts had expressed about the Disney deal.[25] Some of those conditions were
      that Pixar HR policies would remain intact, including the lack of employment
      contracts. Also, the Pixar name was guaranteed to continue, and the studio would
      remain in its current Emeryville, California location with the  Pixar  sign.
      Finally, branding of films made post-merger would be  Disney•Pixar  (beginning
      with Cars).

      On November 22, 1995, Pixar Animation Studios forever impacted the future of
      film-making, storytelling and the medium of animation with the release of its
      first feature film Disney·Pixar s Toy Story. Released nine years after the founding
      of Pixar, Toy Story exhibited years of creative and technical achievements from
      a small group of passionate computer scientists and animators, led by present
      day President Ed Catmull and Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter. The film,
      marking the birth of the new medium of computer animation, went on to become
      the highest grossing film of 1995 with $362 million in worldwide box office
      receipts. Lasseter, director of Toy Story, was honored with a Special Achievement
      Academy Award® for his  inspired leadership of the Pixar Toy Story team resulting
      in the first feature-length computer animated film.

      Since Toy Story s release in 1995, Pixar Animation Studios, in partnership with
      Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, has also created and produced A Bug s Life
      (1998), Toy Story 2 (1999), Monsters, Inc. (2001), Finding Nemo (2003), The
      Incredibles (2004), Cars (2006), Ratatouille (2007), WALL•E (2008), Up (2009),
      Toy Story 3 (2010), Cars 2 (2011), Brave (2012), Monsters University (2013),
      Inside Out (2015), The Good Dinosaur (2015), Finding Dory (2016), Cars 3 (2017),
      Coco (2017), and Incredibles 2 (2018). The feature films have resulted in an
      unprecedented streak of both critical and box office successes, and combined
      to gross more than $6 billion at the worldwide box office. The first 10 feature
      films, through Up, have garnered 35 Academy Award® nominations, nine Oscars®,
      six Golden Globes® and numerous other accolades. The company has also been given
      special thanks in some of Disney s other non-Pixar based films, such as the
      2016 remake of The Jungle Book.

      Pixar s upcoming film is Toy Story 4 (2019).

      From toys, bugs, monsters, fish, superheroes, and cars to rats, robots, grumpy
      old men, fearless young girls, human emotions, dinosaurs and skeletons, Pixar
      s talented creative and technical teams have given audiences of all ages some
      of the most beloved characters in film. Pairing these unique, relatable characters
      with compelling stories and immersive, believable worlds, Pixar continually
      delivers on its promise to truly entertain audiences all over the world.

      Pixar Animation Studios has long believed in making short films. In 1986, Pixar
      s first-ever short, Luxo, Jr., launched a new direction in animated film-making,
      using three-dimensional computer animation to tell a story. Since then, nearly
      every feature film that Pixar has released has included a short beforehand,
      bringing back a tradition that was once an expected pleasure for film goers.

      Pixar s shorts have helped foster and develop technologies and talent at the
      studio, but they are mostly made for one simple reason: love of the art form.
      From Tin Toy s (1989) toy-tormenting baby to Partly Cloudy s (2009) adorable
      storks, Pixar s shorts have delighted audiences and earned critical praise,
      garnering nine Academy Award® nominations and three Best Animated Short Film
      Academy Awards®. Day & Night, the studio s most recent short, debuted in theaters
      with Toy Story 3.

      Pixar has also released several TV series, including:

      RenderMan is the render software Pixar created in 1988, and now uses to help
      produce its CGI films. Since it s creation, RenderMan has become the industry-standard
      and has since been used to render many films including The Abyss, Terminator
      II, and Jurassic Park.

      Marionette is the animation software developed and used in-house by Pixar Animation
      Studios in the animation of their movies and shorts. Marionette is not available
      for sale and is only used by Pixar. As a result little is known outside of Pixar
      about the detailed workings of this software.

      Pixar claims that Marionette is designed to be intuitive and familiar to animators
      who have traditional cel animation experience. Pixar chooses to use a proprietary
      system in lieu of the commercial products available and used by other companies
      because it can edit the software code to meet their needs.

      Since December 2005, Pixar has held exhibitions celebrating the art and artists
      of Pixar, over their first twenty years in animation.

      Pixar held one such exhibition, from April to June 2010, at Science Centre Singapore,
      in Jurong East, Singapore. It was their first time holding an exhibition in
      Singapore.

      The exhibition highlights consist of work-in-progress sketches from various
      Pixar productions, clay sculptures of their characters, and an autostereoscopic
      short showcasing a 3D version of the exhibition pieces which is projected through
      4 projectors. Another highlight is the Zoetrope, where visitors of the exhibition
      are shown figurines of Toy Story characters  animated  in real-life through
      the zoetrope.

      Pixar celebrated 25 years of animation in 2011, the year when Cars 2 was released.
      Pixar celebrated its 20th anniversary with the first Cars. The Pixar: 25 Years
      of Animation exhibition was held at the Oakland Museum of California from July
      2010 until January 2011. The exhibition was also held at the Hong Kong Heritage
      Museum in Shatin from March to July 2011.

      Pixar: 25 Years of Animation includes all of the artwork from Pixar: 20 Years
      of Animation, plus art from Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up, and Toy Story 3. The Hong
      Kong exhibition will feature some never-before-seen artwork and animations that
      are exclusive to Hong Kong.

      The Science Behind Pixar is a travelling exhibition developed by the Museum
      of Science in Boston in collaboration with Pixar. The exhibition demonstrates
      the production pipeline at Pixar in the form of the filmmaking process. It started
      its tour in June 2015 at the Museum of Science and is expected to be touring
      for ten years to other museums around the United States with limited tour availability
      beginning in 2021.

      Pixar celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2016, the year they released Finding
      Dory. To celebrate, they have upgraded their art exhibition to feature art from
      Cars 2, Brave, Monsters University, Inside Out, The Good Dinosaur and Finding
      Dory. Pixar: 30 Years of Animation was held at the Museum of Contemporary Art
      in Tokyo, Japan from March 5 to May 29, 2016 and at Nagasaki Prefectural Art
      Museum in Nagasaki from July 27 to September 8.[14]

      Pixar Animation Studios, commonly referred to as Pixar (/ˈpɪksɑːr/), is an American
      computer animation film studio based in Emeryville, California, that is a subsidiary
      of Walt Disney Studios, owned by The Walt Disney Company. Pixar began in 1979
      as the Graphics Group, part of the Lucasfilm computer division, before its spin-out
      as a corporation in 1986, with funding by Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs,
      who became the majority shareholder.[2] Disney purchased Pixar in 2006 at a
      valuation of $7.4 billion by converting each share of Pixar stock to 2.3 shares
      of Disney stock,[4][5] a transaction that resulted in Jobs becoming Disney s
      largest single shareholder at the time. Pixar is best known for CGI-animated
      feature films created with RenderMan, Pixar s own implementation of the industry-standard
      RenderMan image-rendering application programming interface, used to generate
      high-quality images.

      Pixar has produced 20 feature films, beginning with Toy Story (1995), which
      was the first-ever computer-animated feature film; its most recent film was
      Incredibles 2 (2018). All of the studio s films have debuted with CinemaScore
      ratings of at least an  A−,  indicating positive receptions with audiences.[6]
      The studio has also produced dozens of short films. As of August 2018[update],
      its feature films have earned approximately $13 billion at the worldwide box
      office,[7] with an average worldwide gross of $659.7 million per film.[8] Finding
      Nemo (2003), along with its sequel Finding Dory (2016), as well as Toy Story
      3 (2010) and Incredibles 2 (2018) are among the 50 highest-grossing films of
      all time, with the latter being the second-highest-grossing animated film of
      all time with a gross of $1.2 billion. Fifteen of Pixar s films are also among
      the 50 highest-grossing animated films of all time.

      The studio has earned 19 Academy Awards, 8 Golden Globe Awards, and 11 Grammy
      Awards, among many other awards and acknowledgments. Many of Pixar s films have
      been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature since its inauguration
      in 2001, with nine winning; this includes Finding Nemo (2003) and Toy Story
      3 (2010), along with The Incredibles (2004), Ratatouille (2007), WALL-E (2008),
      Up (2009), Brave (2012), Inside Out (2015), and Coco (2017). Monsters, Inc.
      (2001) and Cars (2006) are the only two films that were nominated for the award
      without winning it, while Cars 2 (2011), Monsters University (2013), The Good
      Dinosaur (2015), Finding Dory (2016), and Cars 3 (2017), were not nominated.
      Up and Toy Story 3 were also the respective second and third animated films
      to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, the first being Walt
      Disney Animation Studios  Beauty and the Beast (1991). Luxo Jr., a character
      from the studio s 1986 short film of the same name, is the studio s mascot.

      On September 6, 2009, Pixar executives John Lasseter, Brad Bird, Pete Docter,
      Andrew Stanton, and Lee Unkrich were presented with the Golden Lion award for
      Lifetime Achievement by the Venice Film Festival. The award was given to Lucasfilm
      s founder George Lucas.

      A Pixar Computer at the Computer History Museum with the 1986–95 logo on it.

      Pixar got its start in 1974 when New York Institute of Technology s (NYIT) founder
      Alexander Schure, who was also the owner of a traditional animation studio,
      established the Computer Graphics Lab (CGL), recruited computer scientists who
      shared his ambitions about creating the world s first computer-animated film.
      Edwin Catmull and Malcolm Blanchard were the first to be hired and were soon
      joined by Alvy Ray Smith and David DiFrancesco some months later, which were
      the four original members of the Computer Graphics Lab.[9] Schure kept pouring
      money into the computer graphics lab, an estimated $15 million, giving the group
      everything they desired and driving NYIT into serious financial troubles.[10]
      Eventually, the group realized they needed to work in a real film studio in
      order to reach their goal. Francis Ford Coppola then invited Smith to his house
      for a three-day media conference, where Coppola and George Lucas shared their
      visions for the future of digital moviemaking.[11]

      When Lucas approached them and offered them a job at his studio, six employees
      decided to move over to Lucasfilm. During the following months, they gradually
      resigned from CGL, found temporary jobs for about a year to avoid making Schure
      suspicious, before they joined The Graphics Group at Lucasfilm.[12][13]

      The Graphics Group, which was one-third of the Computer Division of Lucasfilm,
      was launched in 1979 with the hiring of Catmull from NYIT,[14] where he was
      in charge of the Computer Graphics Lab. He was then reunited with Smith, who
      also made the journey from NYIT to Lucasfilm, and was made the director of The
      Graphics Group. At NYIT, the researchers pioneered many of the CG foundation
      techniques—in particular the invention of the alpha channel (by Catmull and
      Smith).[15] Years later, the CGL produced a few frames of an experimental film
      called The Works. After moving to Lucasfilm, the team worked on creating the
      precursor to RenderMan, called REYES (for  renders everything you ever saw )
      and developed a number of critical technologies for CG—including  particle effects  and
      various animation tools.

      In 1982, the team began working on special effects film sequences with Industrial
      Light & Magic. After years of research, and key milestones such as the Genesis
      Effect in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and the Stained Glass Knight in Young
      Sherlock Holmes,[14] the group, which then numbered 40 individuals, was spun
      out as a corporation in February 1986 by Catmull and Smith. Among the 38 remaining
      employees, there were also Malcolm Blanchard, David DiFrancesco, Ralph Guggenheim,
      and Bill Reeves, who had been part of the team since the days of NYIT. Tom Duff,
      also an NYIT member, would later join Pixar after its formation.[2] With Lucas  1983
      divorce, which coincided with the sudden dropoff in revenues from Star Wars
      licenses following the release of Return of the Jedi, they knew he would most
      likely sell the whole Graphics Group. Worried that the employees would be lost
      to them if that happened, which would prevent the creation of the first computer
      animated movie, they concluded that the best way to keep the team together was
      to turn the group into an independent company. But Moore s Law also said that
      the first film was still some years away, and they needed to focus on a proper
      product while waiting for computers to become powerful enough. Eventually, they
      decided they should be a hardware company in the meantime, with their Pixar
      Image Computer as the core product, a system primarily sold to government agencies
      and the scientific and medical community.[2][10][16]

      In 1983, Nolan Bushnell founded a new computer-guided animation studio called
      Kadabrascope as a subsidiary of his Chuck E. Cheese s Pizza Time Theatres company
      (PTT), which was founded in 1977. Only one major project was made out of the
      new studio, an animated Christmas movie for NBC starring Chuck E. Cheese and
      other PTT mascots. The animation movement would be made using tweening instead
      of traditional cel animation. After the North American Video Game Crash of 1983,
      Bushnell started selling some subsidiaries of PTT to keep the business afloat.
      Sente Technologies (another division, was founded to have games distributed
      in PTT stores) was sold to Bally Games and Kadabrascope was sold to Lucasfilm.
      The Kadabrascope assets were combined with the Computer Division of Lucasfilm.[17]
      Coincidentally, one of Steve Jobs  first jobs was under Bushnell in 1973 as
      a technician at his other company Atari, which Bushnell sold to Warner Communications
      in 1976 to focus on PTT.[18] PTT would later go bankrupt in 1985 and be acquired
      by ShowBiz Pizza Place.

      Independent company[edit]

      An Introduction to Ray Tracing (1989) features contributions from several Pixar
      employees.

      The newly independent Pixar (1986) was headed by Edwin Catmull as President
      and Alvy Ray Smith as Executive Vice President. While looking for investors,
      Steve Jobs showed interest, but initially, Lucas found his offer too low. Yet
      he eventually accepted after it turned out to be impossible to find other investors.
      At that point Smith and Catmull had been turned down 45 times; thirty-five venture
      capitalists and 10 large corporations had declined.[19] Jobs, who had recently
      been fired from Apple,[2] and was now founder and CEO of the new computer company
      NeXT, paid $5 million of his own money to George Lucas for technology rights
      and invested $5 million cash as capital into the company, joining the board
      of directors as chairman.[2]

      In 1985, while still at Lucasfilm, they had made a deal with the Japanese publisher
      Shogakukan to make a computer-animated movie called Monkey, based on the Monkey
      King. The project continued sometime after they became a separate company in
      1986, but in the end, it became clear that the technology was simply not there
      yet. The computers were not powerful enough and the budget would be too high.
      So it was decided to focus on the computer hardware business some more years
      while waiting till Moore s law made a computer-animated feature possible.[20][21]

      At the time Walt Disney Studios was interested and eventually bought and used
      the Pixar Image Computer and custom software written by Pixar as part of their
      Computer Animation Production System (CAPS) project, to migrate the laborious
      ink and paint part of the 2D animation process to a more automated method.

      In a bid to drive sales of the system and increase the company s capital, Jobs
      suggested to make the system available to mainstream users and released the
      product to the market. Pixar employee John Lasseter, who had long been working
      on not-for-profit short demonstration animations, such as Luxo Jr. (1986) to
      show off the device s capabilities, premiered his creations at SIGGRAPH, the
      computer graphics industry s largest convention, to great fanfare.[22]

      However, the Image Computer never sold well.[22] Inadequate sales threatened
      to put the company out of business as financial losses grew. Jobs invested more
      and more money in exchange for an increased stake in the company, reducing the
      proportion of management and employee ownership until eventually, his total
      investment of $50 million gave him control of the entire company. In 1989, Lasseter
      s growing animation department, originally composed of just four people (Lasseter,
      Bill Reeves, Eben Ostby, and Sam Leffler), was turned into a division that produced
      computer-animated commercials for outside companies.[1][23][24] In April 1990,
      Pixar sold its hardware division, including all proprietary hardware technology
      and imaging software, to Vicom Systems, and transferred 18 of Pixar s approximately
      100 employees. That same year, Pixar moved from San Rafael to Richmond, California.[25]
      Pixar released some of its software tools on the open market for Macintosh and
      Windows systems. RenderMan was one of the leading 3D packages of the early 1990s,
      and Typestry was a special-purpose 3D text renderer that competed with RayDream
      addDepth.

      During this period Pixar continued its successful relationship with Walt Disney
      Animation Studios, a studio whose corporate parent would ultimately become its
      most important partner. As 1991 began, however, the layoff of 30 employees in
      the company s computer hardware department—including the company s president,
      Chuck Kolstad,[26] reduced the total number of employees to just 42, essentially
      its original number.[27] Yet Pixar made a historic $26 million deal with Disney
      to produce three computer-animated feature films, the first of which was Toy
      Story. By then the software programmers, who were doing RenderMan and IceMan,
      and Lasseter s animation department, which made television commercials (and
      four Luxo Jr. shorts for Sesame Street the same year), were all that remained
      of Pixar.[28]

      Despite the total income from these projects the company continued to lose money
      and Jobs, as chairman of the board and now the full owner, often considered
      selling it. Even as late as 1994 Jobs contemplated selling Pixar to other companies
      such as Hallmark Cards, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, and Oracle CEO and
      co-founder Larry Ellison.[29] Only after learning from New York critics that
      Toy Story would probably be a hit—and confirming that Disney would distribute
      it for the 1995 Christmas season—did he decide to give Pixar another chance.[30][31]
      For the first time, he also took an active leadership role in the company and
      made himself CEO.[citation needed] Toy Story went on to gross more than $373
      million worldwide[32] and, when Pixar held its initial public offering on November
      29, 1995, it exceeded Netscape s as the biggest IPO of the year. In only its
      first half-hour of trading Pixar stock shot from $22 to $45, delaying trading
      because of un-matched buy orders. Shares climbed to $49 before closing the day
      at $39.[33]

      During the 1990s and 2000s, Pixar gradually developed the  Pixar Braintrust,  the
      studio s primary creative development process, in which all directors, writers,
      and lead storyboard artists at the studio look at each other s projects on a
      regular basis and give each other very candid  notes  (the industry term for
      constructive criticism).[34] The Braintrust operates under a philosophy of a  filmmaker-driven
      studio,  in which creatives help each other move their films forward through
      a process somewhat like peer review, as opposed to the traditional Hollywood
      approach of an  executive-driven studio  in which directors are micromanaged
      through  mandatory notes  from development executives ranking above the producers.[35][36]
      According to Catmull, it evolved out of the working relationship between Lasseter,
      Stanton, Docter, Unkrich, and Joe Ranft on Toy Story.[34]

      As a result of the success of Toy Story, Pixar built a new studio at the Emeryville
      campus which was designed by PWP Landscape Architecture and opened in November
      2000.

      Collaboration with Disney[edit]

      Pixar and Disney had disagreements over the production of Toy Story 2. Originally
      intended as a straight-to-video release (and thus not part of Pixar s three-picture
      deal), the film was eventually upgraded to a theatrical release during production.
      Pixar demanded that the film then be counted toward the three-picture agreement,
      but Disney refused.[37] Though profitable for both, Pixar later complained that
      the arrangement was not equitable. Pixar was responsible for creation and production,
      while Disney handled marketing and distribution. Profits and production costs
      were split 50-50, but Disney exclusively owned all story, character and sequel
      rights and also collected a 10- to 15-percent distribution fee. The lack of
      story, character and sequel rights was perhaps the most onerous aspect to Pixar
      and set the stage for a contentious relationship.[38]

      The two companies attempted to reach a new agreement for ten months before it
      fell through in January 2004. The new deal would be only for distribution, as
      Pixar intended to control production and own the resulting story, character
      and sequel rights themselves while Disney would own the right of first refusal
      to distribute any sequels. Pixar also wanted to finance their films on their
      own and collect 100 percent of the profits, paying Disney only the 10- to 15-percent
      distribution fee.[39] More importantly, as part of any distribution agreement
      with Disney, Pixar demanded control over films already in production under their
      old agreement, including The Incredibles (2004) and Cars (2006). Disney considered
      these conditions unacceptable, but Pixar would not concede.[39]

      Disagreements between Steve Jobs and then-Disney chairman and CEO Michael Eisner
      made the negotiations more difficult than they otherwise might have been. They
      broke down completely in mid-2004, with Disney forming Circle 7 Animation and
      Jobs declaring that Pixar was actively seeking partners other than Disney.[40]
      Despite this announcement, Pixar did not enter negotiations with other distributors,[41]
      although a Warner Bros. spokesperson told CNN,  We would love to be in business
      with Pixar. They are a great company. [39] After a lengthy hiatus, negotiations
      between the two companies resumed following the departure of Eisner from Disney
      in September 2005. In preparation for potential fallout between Pixar and Disney,
      Jobs announced in late 2004 that Pixar would no longer release movies at the
      Disney-dictated November time frame, but during the more lucrative early summer
      months. This would also allow Pixar to release DVDs for their major releases
      during the Christmas shopping season. An added benefit of delaying Cars from
      November 4, 2005, to June 9, 2006, was to extend the time frame remaining on
      the Pixar-Disney contract, to see how things would play out between the two
      companies.[41]

      Pending the Disney acquisition of Pixar, the two companies created a distribution
      deal for the intended 2007 release of Ratatouille, if the acquisition fell through,
      to ensure that this one film would still be released through Disney s distribution
      channels. In contrast to the earlier Pixar deal, Ratatouille was to remain a
      Pixar property and Disney would have received only a distribution fee. The completion
      of Disney s Pixar acquisition, however, nullified this distribution arrangement.[42]

      Acquisition by Disney[edit]

      In 2006, Disney ultimately agreed to buy Pixar for approximately $7.4 billion
      in an all-stock deal.[43] Following Pixar shareholder approval, the acquisition
      was completed May 5, 2006. The transaction catapulted Jobs, who owned 49.65%
      of total share interest in Pixar, to Disney s largest individual shareholder
      with 7%, valued at $3.9 billion, and a new seat on its board of directors.[5][44]
      Jobs  new Disney holdings exceeded holdings belonging to ex-CEO Michael Eisner,
      the previous top shareholder, who still held 1.7%; and Disney Director Emeritus
      Roy E. Disney, who held almost 1% of the corporation s shares. Pixar shareholders
      received 2.3 shares of Disney common stock for each share of Pixar common stock
      redeemed.

      As part of the deal, John Lasseter, by then Executive Vice President, became
      Chief Creative Officer (reporting directly to President and CEO Robert Iger
      and consulting with Disney Director Roy E. Disney) of both Pixar and Walt Disney
      Animation Studios (including its division DisneyToon Studios), as well as the
      Principal Creative Adviser at Walt Disney Imagineering, which designs and builds
      the company s theme parks.[44] Catmull retained his position as President of
      Pixar, while also becoming President of Walt Disney Animation Studios, reporting
      to Iger and Dick Cook, chairman of the Walt Disney Studios. Jobs  position as
      Pixar s chairman and chief executive officer was abolished, and instead, he
      took a place on the Disney board of directors.[45]

      After the deal closed in May 2006, Lasseter revealed that Iger had realized
      Disney needed to buy Pixar while watching a parade at the opening of Hong Kong
      Disneyland in September 2005.[46] Iger noticed that of all the Disney characters
      in the parade, not one was a character that Disney had created within the last
      ten years since all the newer ones had been created by Pixar.[46] Upon returning
      to Burbank, Iger commissioned a financial analysis that confirmed that Disney
      had actually lost money on animation for the past decade, then presented that
      information to the board of directors at his first board meeting after being
      promoted from COO to CEO, and the board, in turn, authorized him to explore
      the possibility of a deal with Pixar.[47] Lasseter and Catmull were wary when
      the topic of Disney buying Pixar first came up, but Jobs asked them to give
      Iger a chance (based on his own experience negotiating with Iger in summer 2005
      for the rights to ABC shows for the fifth-generation iPod Classic),[48] and
      in turn, Iger convinced them of the sincerity of his epiphany that Disney really
      needed to re-focus on animation.[46]

      John Lasseter appears with characters from Up at the 2009 Venice Film Festival.

      Lasseter and Catmull s oversight of both the Disney Animation and Pixar studios
      did not mean that the two studios were merging, however. In fact, additional
      conditions were laid out as part of the deal to ensure that Pixar remained a
      separate entity, a concern that analysts had expressed about the Disney deal.[49]
      Some of those conditions were that Pixar HR policies would remain intact, including
      the lack of employment contracts. Also, the Pixar name was guaranteed to continue,
      and the studio would remain in its current Emeryville, California, location
      with the  Pixar  sign. Finally, branding of films made post-merger would be  Disney•Pixar  (beginning
      with Cars).[50]

      Jim Morris, producer of WALL-E (2008), became general manager of Pixar. In this
      new position, Morris took charge of the day-to-day running of the studio facilities
      and products.[51]

      After a few years, Lasseter and Catmull were able to successfully transfer the
      basic principles of the Pixar Braintrust to Disney Animation, although meetings
      of the Disney Story Trust are reportedly  more polite  than those of the Pixar
      Braintrust.[52] Catmull later explained that after the merger, to maintain the
      studios  separate identities and cultures (notwithstanding the fact of common
      ownership and common senior management), he and Lasseter  drew a hard line  that
      each studio was solely responsible for its own projects and would not be allowed
      to borrow personnel from or lend tasks out to the other.[53][54] That rule ensures
      that each studio maintains  local ownership  of projects and can be proud of
      its own work.[53][54] Thus, for example, when Pixar had issues with Ratatouille
      and Disney Animation had issues with Bolt (2008),  nobody bailed them out  and
      each studio was required  to solve the problem on its own  even when they knew
      there were personnel at the other studio who theoretically could have helped.[53][54]

      In November 2014, Morris was promoted to president of Pixar, while his counterpart
      at Disney Animation, general manager Andrew Millstein, was also promoted to
      president of that studio.[55] Both continue to report to Catmull, who retains
      the title of president of both Disney Animation and Pixar.[55]

      On November 21, 2017, Lasseter announced that he was taking a six-month leave
      of absence after acknowledging  missteps  in his behavior with employees in
      a memo to staff. According to The Hollywood Reporter and The Washington Post,
      Lasseter had a history of alleged sexual misconduct towards employees.[56][57][58]
      On June 8, 2018, it was announced that Lasseter would leave Disney Animation
      and Pixar at the end of the year, but would take on a consulting role until
      then.[59] Pete Docter was announced as Lasseter s replacement as chief creative
      officer of Pixar on June 19, 2018.[60]

      On October 23, 2018, it was announced that Ed Catmull would be retiring, and
      will stay in an adviser role until July 2019.[61] On January 18, 2019, it was
      announced that Lee Unkrich would be leaving Pixar after 25 years.[62]

      On April 20, 2010, Pixar opened Pixar Canada in the downtown area of Vancouver,
      British Columbia, Canada.[63] The roughly 2,000 square meters studio produced
      seven short films based on Toy Story and Cars characters. In October 2013, the
      studio was closed down to refocus Pixar s efforts at its main headquarters.[64]

      Headquarters (campus)[edit]

      The Steve Jobs Building at Pixar s campus in Emeryville

      The atrium of the Pixar campus

      When Steve Jobs, chief executive officer of Apple Inc. and Pixar, and John Lasseter,
      then-executive vice president of Pixar, decided to move their studios from a
      leased space in Point Richmond, California, to larger quarters of their own,
      they chose a 20-acre site in Emeryville, California,[65] formerly occupied by
      Del Monte Foods, Inc. The first of several buildings, a high-tech structure
      designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson,[66] has special foundations and generators
      to ensure continued film production, even through major earthquakes. The character
      of the building is intended to abstractly recall Emeryville s industrial past.
      The two-story steel-and-masonry building is a collaborative space with many
      pathways.

      The digital revolution in filmmaking was driven by applied mathematics, including
      computational physics and geometry.[67] In 2008, this led Pixar senior scientist
      Tony DeRose to offer to host the second Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival
      at the Emeryville headquarters.[68]

      Feature films and shorts[edit]

      and nominations

      While some of Pixar s first animators were former cel animators including John
      Lasseter, they also came from computer animation or were fresh college graduates.[14]
      A large number of animators that make up the animation department at Pixar were
      hired around the time the studio released A Bug s Life (1998), Monsters, Inc.
      (2001) and Finding Nemo (2003). Although Toy Story was a successful film, it
      was Pixar s first feature film at the time, becoming the first major computer-animation
      studio to successfully produce theatrical feature films. The majority of the
      animation industry was (and still is) located in Los Angeles while Pixar is
      located 350 miles (560 km) north in the San Francisco Bay Area. Also, traditional
      hand-drawn animation was still the dominant medium for feature animated films.

      With the scarcity of Los Angeles-based animators willing to move their families
      so far north to give up traditional animation and try computer animation, Pixar
      s new hires at this time either came directly from college or had worked outside
      feature animation. For those who had traditional animation skills, the Pixar
      animation software Marionette was designed so that traditional animators would
      require a minimum amount of training before becoming productive.[14]

      In an interview with PBS talk show host Tavis Smiley,[69] Lasseter said that
      Pixar s films follow the same theme of self-improvement as the company itself
      has: with the help of friends or family, a character ventures out into the real
      world and learns to appreciate his friends and family. At the core, Lasseter
      said,  it s gotta be about the growth of the main character and how he changes.
      [69]

      As of 2018[update], every Pixar feature film has included a character voiced
      by John Ratzenberger, who had famously starred in the TV show Cheers. Pixar
      paid tribute to their  good luck charm  in the end credits of Cars (2006) by
      parodying scenes from three of their earlier films, replacing all of the characters
      with motor vehicles. After the third scene, Mack (his character in Cars) realizes
      that the same actor has been voicing characters in every film.

      Due to the traditions that have occurred within the film such as anthropomorphic
      animals and easter egg crossovers between films that have been spotted by Pixar
      fans, a blog post entitled The Pixar Theory was published in 2013 by Jon Negroni
      proposing that all of the characters within the Pixar universe were related.[70][71][72]

      Sequels and prequels[edit]

      Toy Story 2 was originally commissioned by Disney as a 60-minute direct-to-video
      film. Expressing doubts about the strength of the material, John Lasseter convinced
      the Pixar team to start from scratch and make the sequel their third full-length
      feature film.

      Following the release of Toy Story 2 in 1999, Pixar and Disney had a gentlemen
      s agreement that Disney would not make any sequels without Pixar s involvement
      despite their own right to do so. After the two companies were unable to agree
      on a new deal, Disney announced in 2004 they would plan to move forward on sequels
      with/without Pixar and put Toy Story 3 into pre-production at Disney s then-new
      CGI division Circle 7 Animation. However, when Lasseter was placed in charge
      of all Disney and Pixar animation following Disney s acquisition of Pixar in
      2006, he put all sequels on hold and Toy Story 3 was canceled. In May 2006,
      it was announced that Toy Story 3 was back in pre-production with a new plot
      and under Pixar s control. The film was released on June 18, 2010 as Pixar s
      eleventh feature film.

      Shortly after announcing the resurrection of Toy Story 3, Lasseter fueled speculation
      on further sequels by saying,  If we have a great story, we ll do a sequel.
      [73] Cars 2, Pixar s first non-Toy Story sequel, was officially announced in
      April 2008 and released on June 24, 2011 as their twelfth. Monsters University,
      a prequel to Monsters, Inc. (2001), was announced in April 2010 and initially
      set for release in November 2012;[74] the release date was pushed to June 21,
      2013 due to Pixar s past success with summer releases according to a Disney
      executive.[75]

      In June 2011, Tom Hanks, who voiced Woody in the Toy Story series, implied that
      Toy Story 4 was  in the works,  although it had not yet been confirmed by the
      studio.[76][77] In April 2013, Finding Dory, a sequel to Finding Nemo, was announced
      for a June 17, 2016 release.[78] In March 2014, Incredibles 2 and Cars 3 were
      announced as films in development.[79] In November 2014, Toy Story 4 was confirmed
      to be in development with Lasseter serving as director.[80] In an interview,
      Lasseter stated that  [a] lot of people in the industry view us doing sequels
      as being for the business of it, but for us, it s pure passion...One of the
      things that was very important for me as an artist is to continue directing.
      When I direct, I get to work with the individual artists, with the animators.
      [81] In August 2015, at the D23 Expo, Lasseter said that the film would focus
      on the romance between Woody and Bo Peep.[82] Its story will be built on the
      fact that Bo Peep was absent in Toy Story 3, with Woody and Buzz Lightyear trying
      to find her and bring her back.[83]

      Adaptation to television[edit]

      Toy Story was the first Pixar film to be adapted for television as Buzz Lightyear
      of Star Command film and TV series. Cars became the second with the help of
      Cars Toons, a series of 3-to-5-minute short films running between regular Disney
      Channel shows and featuring Mater (a tow truck voiced by comedian Larry the
      Cable Guy).[84] Between 2013 and 2014, Pixar released its first two television
      specials, Toy Story of Terror![85] and Toy Story That Time Forgot. A television
      series spin-off of Monsters, Inc. was confirmed in a Disney press release in
      November 2017.[86]

      Animation and live-action[edit]

      All Pixar films and shorts to date have been computer-animated features, but
      WALL-E so far has been the only Pixar film to not be completely animated as
      it featured a small amount of live-action footage while Day & Night is the only
      short to feature 2D animation. 1906, the live-action film by Brad Bird based
      on a screenplay and novel by James Dalessandro about the 1906 earthquake, was
      in development but has since been abandoned by Bird and Pixar. Bird has stated
      that he was  interested in moving into the live-action realm with some projects  while  staying
      at Pixar [because] it s a very comfortable environment for me to work in . In
      June 2018, Bird mentioned the possibility of adapting the novel as a TV series,
      with the earthquake sequence as a live-action feature film.[87]

      The Toy Story Toons short Hawaiian Vacation also includes the fish and shark
      as live-action.

      Jim Morris, president of Pixar, produced Disney s John Carter (2012) which Andrew
      Stanton co-wrote and directed.[88]

      Pixar s creative heads were consulted to fine tune the script for the 2011 live-action
      film The Muppets.[89] Similarly, Pixar assisted in the story development of
      Disney s The Jungle Book (2016) as well as providing suggestions for the film
      s end credits sequence.[90] Both Pixar and Mark Andrews were given an  Special
      Thanks  credit in the film s credits.[91] Additionally, many Pixar animators,

      Pixar representatives have also assisted in the English localization of several
      Studio Ghibli films, mainly those from Hayao Miyazaki.[93]

      Since December 2005, Pixar has held exhibitions celebrating the art and artists
      of themselves over their first twenty years in animation.[106]

      Pixar: 21 Years of Animation[edit]

      Pixar celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2006 with the release of its seventh
      feature film Cars, and held two exhibitions from April to June 2010 at Science
      Centre Singapore in Jurong East, Singapore and the London Science Museum in
      London.[107] It was their first time holding an exhibition in Singapore.

      The exhibition highlights consist of work-in-progress sketches from various
      Pixar productions, clay sculptures of their characters and an autostereoscopic
      short showcasing a 3D version of the exhibition pieces which is projected through
      four projectors. Another highlight is the Zoetrope, where visitors of the exhibition
      are shown figurines of Toy Story characters  animated  in real-life through
      the zoetrope.[107]

      Pixar celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2011 with the release of its twelfth
      feature film Cars 2, and held an exhibition at the Oakland Museum of California
      from July 2010 until January 2011.[108] The exhibition tour debuted in Hong
      Kong and was held at the Hong Kong Heritage Museum in Sha Tin from March 27
      to July 11, 2011.[109][110] In 2013, the exhibition was held in the EXPO in
      Amsterdam, The Netherlands. For 6 months from July 6, 2012 until January 6,
      2013 the city of Bonn (Germany) hosted the public showing,[111]

      On November 16, 2013, the exhibition moved to the Art Ludique museum in Paris,
      France with a scheduled run until March 2, 2014.[112] The exhibition moved to
      three Spanish cities later in 2014 and 2015: Madrid (held in CaixaForum from
      March 21 until June 22),[113] Barcelona (held also in Caixaforum from February
      until May) and Zaragoza.[114]

      Pixar: 25 Years of Animation includes all of the artwork from Pixar: 20 Years
      of Animation, plus art from Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up and Toy Story 3.

      The Science Behind Pixar[edit]

      The Science Behind Pixar is a travelling exhibition that first opened on June
      28, 2015, at the Museum of Science in Boston, Massachusetts. It was developed
      by the Museum of Science in collaboration with Pixar. The exhibit features forty
      interactive elements that explain the production pipeline at Pixar. They are
      divided into eight sections, each demonstrating a step in the filmmaking process:
      Modeling, Rigging, Surfaces, Sets & Cameras, Animation, Simulation, Lighting,
      and Rendering. Before visitors enter the exhibit, they watch a short video at
      an introductory theater showing Mr. Ray from Finding Nemo and Roz from Monsters,
      Inc..

      The exhibition closed on January 10, 2016 and was moved to the Franklin Institute
      in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where it ran from March 12 to September 5. Afterwards,
      it moved to the California Science Center in Los Angeles, California and was
      open from October 15, 2016 to April 9, 2017. It made another stop at the Science
      Museum of Minnesota in St. Paul, Minnesota from May 27 through September 4,
      2017.[115]

      The exhibition opened in Canada on July 1, 2017 at the TELUS World of Science
      - Edmonton (TWOSE).

      Pixar: The Design of Story[edit]

      Pixar: The Design of Story was an exhibition held at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian
      Design Museum in New York City from October 8, 2015 to September 11, 2016.[116][117]
      The museum also hosted a presentation and conversation with John Lasseter on
      November 12, 2015 entitled  Design By Hand: Pixar s John Lasseter .[116]

      Pixar celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2016 with the release of its seventeenth
      feature film Finding Dory, and put together another milestone exhibition. The

    - "Pixar Animation Studios: Creative Kaizen\nBy HBSstudent11\nIliad S.A.: the\
      \ story behind France’s telecommunications maverick\nHow Pixar’s innovative\
      \ production process ensures creative quality for audiences\nPixar: A Winner\n\
      Pixar has been highly effective at aligning its business and operating models\
      \ to drive success. Founded 1986, Pixar has produced 16 feature animated films\
      \ which together have grossed almost $4 billion at the box office (1). Critically\
      \ acclaimed projects include: Toy Story, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, Up, and\
      \ Finding Nemo. Disney took notice of Pixar’s ability to churn out blockbusters,\
      \ and acquired them in 2006 (2). This ability seems to be driven by Pixar’s\
      \ unique model of organization, production, and talent retention.\nPixar makes\
      \ money by unifying art and technology to produce original animated films that\
      \ motivate audiences to buy movie tickets, DVDs, digital copies, and merchandise.\
      \ These films are marketed towards children, but have the emotional depth and\
      \ production quality to appeal to adults. Pixar’s key market differentiator\
      \ is its focus on quality. Instead of throwing out a portfolio of movies every\
      \ year and hoping that a few become blockbusters, Pixar makes big bets on a\
      \ fewer number of films, producing one film every four to five years. It minimizes\
      \ risk by ensuring the quality of these films via a highly monitored production\
      \ process.\nPixar has a very unique operating model compared to other film studios.\
      \ In other studios, new creative teams are formed around new film concepts and\
      \ then disbanded once the films are complete. Pixar takes a drastically different\
      \ approach and retains creative talent as long-term employees. This allows teams\
      \ to improve their skills and operating processes over time with increased repetition\
      \ (3). Pixar leaders believe that the initial idea matters a lot less than the\
      \ people who actually iterate and brainstorm around that idea throughout the\
      \ production process (4). Other key elements of Pixar’s successful operating\
      \ model include:\nIncubator Teams: When concepts are still nascent, small teams\
      \ of directors, writers, and artists serve as incubators that work together\
      \ to improve and expand on the initial ideas. This tests the idea, but also\
      \ serves as a way for teams to feel out their strengths and weaknesses and learn\
      \ how they should work together moving forward (4).\nShared Dailies: Every day,\
      \ directors and producers must show their daily work to everyone (instead of\
      \ just a small team like at other studios). All members of the crew are encouraged\
      \ to offer suggestions for improvement. Dailies serve as a great way to share\
      \ information with the entire team and break down departmental barriers (4).\n\
      Creative Brain Trust: This is a committee of creative leaders in the company\
      \ that directors/producers can access to help solve production problems. An\
      \ important and unique dynamic of this group is that, unlike traditional studio\
      \ development executives, the advisors of this committee have no authority.\
      \ Instead, they are peers whose purpose is solely to offer creative input and\
      \ advice (5).\nPostmortems: These are meetings that occur after a film is finished\
      \ and discuss the successes and failures of the process. This is critical for\
      \ the growth of the teams (as they will largely remain together to work on the\
      \ next Pixar film) and helps improve work output and processes for the future\
      \ (4).\nPixar University: The company offers classes across disciplines to foster\
      \ communication between departments and emphasize the idea of “learning and\
      \ growing together” (3).\nPixar Campus: The campus has an open plan that maximizes\
      \ interaction among colleagues during the workday to stimulate conversation\
      \ and free flow of ideas (3).\nBusiness and Operating Model Alignment\nThe business\
      \ and operating models are both aligned on Pixar’s key competitive advantages:\
      \ creativity and quality. Pixar has become a consumer-facing brand associated\
      \ with a high level of creativity and quality — and they want to sustain this\
      \ brand identity to retain loyal audiences. To ensure that this production value\
      \ is being provided to customers, the production process is highly detail-oriented\
      \ and based on constant iteration, refinement, and team growth and learning.\
      \ A Harvard Business Review article even likened Pixar’s continuous improvement\
      \ model to that of Toyota’s “Kaizen” philosophy (6). The operating model also\
      \ supports the business model and decreases the risk of a very expensive film\
      \ failure by subjecting the work in process to constant quality control checks.\
      \ High levels of cooperation and sharing throughout the production process allows\
      \ for errors in storyline, dialogue, or visual effects to be caught early and\
      \ often — before the process is too far along for these problems to be fixed\
      \ (4). Though this increases the cycle time of the process (often only 2 seconds\
      \ of a film is worked on each day!), Pixar’s box office performance has shown\
      \ that the value gained from this process in quality and creativity added has\
      \ definitely paid off (7).\nSources Cited/Used:\nhttp://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=pixar.htm\n\

      Buzz Lightyear, I am your biggest fan!!! Nice post. Very interesting comparing\
      \ their operating model vs. the rest of Hollywood. I would imagine the reason\
      \ may be related to the criticality of software in teh production process… the\
      \ interface between creative and technical is much more integrative, which may\
      \ motivate keeping people aroudn to drive experience and learning in the more\
      \ complex setting… what do you think?\nDecember 14, 2015\t Buzz Lightyear says:\n\
      I think that the technology/software side of Pixar does have something to do\
      \ with it. Their approach often comes across as more scientific than artistic\
      \ to me. For example, they encourage their tech artists to regularly publish\
      \ articles and present at conferences so that they maintain a strong relationship\
      \ with the academic community.\nIt is interesting to note, however, that elsewhere\
      \ in Hollywood, smaller-scale creative alliances do form. For example, director\
      \ David O. Russell and actress Jennifer Lawrence have worked on multiple movies\
      \ such as Joy, American Hustle, and Silver Linings Playbook together. I also\
      \ saw JJ Abram’s long-time editors (since the show Alias) speak at the LA Film\
      \ Festival this summer, and they said have gotten to know his working style\
      \ over the years, and it seemed like they have refined and improved their working\
      \ processes over time. I am working in development at a production company this\
      \ summer, and hope to learn more about the different operating models happening\
      \ in film/TV and how creative teams form and function!\nhttp://www.filmindependent.org/blogs/j-j-abrams-long-time-editors-reveal-how-to-help-develop-characters-in-the-editing-room/#.Vm9jOxorLUo\n\

      December 14, 2015\t Lior says:\nI’m also a huge Pixar fan and appreciate how\
      \ they managed to create and sustain such a strong operating model (with clear\
      \ link to the business model – quality and creativity). We actually tried mimicking\
      \ this model as we evaluated marketing campaigns in P&G (we formed a community\
      \ of brain trust and made sure to share campaign progress with the entire team.\
      \ We also discussed the successes and failures of the process at the end of\
      \ the campaign). I personally think the idea of using Pixar model to build marketing\
      \ campaigns is a powerful one, but we lacked full commitment to the process.\n\
      Building on that… I was wondering what are your thoughts on using this model\
      \ for different industries? For example, the pharmaceutical industry would also\
      \ benefit from high quality “blockbuster” drugs as opposed to “mini-hits”.\n\
      This is very interesting. To be honest I didn’t know Pixar had a significantly\
      \ different positioning to other movie producers, but I did love most of their\
      \ movies. The different areas you described reminded me a lot the Design Thinking\
      \ process we learned in the IDEO case, with teams brainstorming and converging\
      \ during the day and then use the Incubator Team, Shared Dailies and the Creative\
      \ Brain Trust to validate and/or generate new ideas. I wonder whether they do\
      \ something similar with the target audience or if this limited to employees\
      \ within the company.\nDecember 14, 2015\t AClay says:\nGreat article! I wonder\
      \ if Pixar was able to keep its unique culture after the Disney buyout. Disney\
      \ has such a strong culture itself, that I would imagined that it would be hard\
      \ for Disney’s culture to not suffocate Pixar’s culture.\nAlso, Shared Dailies\
      \ sound freighting like Bridgewater’s immediate feedback model to me. I wonder\
      \ how direct their feedback is at Pixar."

    - You're right. The quality of all of Pixar's movies have increased over the years.
      This is due, in no small part, to the fact that they have long term teams that
      work together on multiple projects. Further, Pixar, as a company, cares more
      about creating high quality movies than they do making the most money possible.
      This is their company's culture and the reason for their continuing success.

      Windows 10 1809 update deleted all files from Documents!

      Last night I updated to 1809, and it all went smoothly, but then I find that
      all my files in Documents are DELETED. Gone. Poof. This included many crucial
      documents and financial info. Yes, I have a backup (I think - using Windows
      Backup to a NAS). But this is pretty bad. Did no one in the first two rings
      run into this yet?

      I understand (from the news) that this happens to all files in Documents that
      aren t synced to OneDrive. Further, the Documents folder is really an agglomeration
      of  Documents  from several different paths - not sure how that works, and it
      may or may not relate.

      Windows update, recovery, & backup

      Hi Stuart, this does seem to be an emerging bug today on the 1809 update, quite
      a few users reporting this . .

      I am really glad to hear you have a backup of your data!

      What has worked for some users is - Restart (not shut down) your PC 3 or 4 times,
      this will fix this issue a lot of the time . . .

      Power to the Developer!

      back? After they have been deleted or during the update? I d like to know so
      when my documents are deleted I can hopefully get them back.

      In reply to Tom_EC s post on October 6, 2018

      Alas - it gets worse. Microsoft s Backup silently stopped backing up back in
      February and didn t tell me, and I didn t notice. So I have maybe 100 hours
      of tedium ahead of me as I try to reconstruct my financial records... And the
      restart (3x) didn t do anything. Sigh.

      I m adding to this thread as well the latest update to 1809 Not only deletes
      files But It made a Mess of my system! First Not only was files Missing After
      a Failed General Error 0xc1900101 and I took Extra Steps to prevent in the first
      place, ie Removed Norton s, Removed other hardware like Blue Tooth Dongle etc.
      it still failed. Upon Restore I noticed lot s of Photo s and Audio file s as
      well as Word Doc s etc missing. Shortcuts from my Quick Launch was gone, and
      My System Fans as well as My Liquid Cooling Pump was in Max Turbo mode. But
      that is the only thing, My Software Lot s Of Software Would not start, or Launch
      at all the service was showing that it was running but No Interface of the software.
      When I dug into the Panther file to find the culprit, It was blank. So I have
      No Idea as to why the generic code 0xc1900101 is being used if it will not tell
      me what caused the failed update. So Be Warned Everyone Make Sure you use a
      Software Like Acronis and Clone Your Drive before starting this Update at lest
      you can get your system back

      Do not upgrade, do a fresh reinstall. This is always the best practice. My system
      is broken anyway even with 1803 as it resets file associations every reboot.
      So it s time to do a fresh install anyway.

      Will wait until end of November, then install 1809 as fresh install when all
      issues are resolved.

      Also I don t like the  multiple destination document  ****. Who needs this crap?
      I want my documents on the drive and partition I want it to. And I want to KNOW
      where it is.

      In Germany you can t use One Drive anyway, as upload speeds here are laughable.
      Online backups are unusable here.

      And I pay 55 EUR per month, and I have cutouts and slowdowns every week. Absolutely
      barbaric.

      Fresh reinstalls are not acceptable, and not a proper procedure anyway.

      This is not a completely new OS, let s get that clear. It s a service pack at
      best.

      I m not going to spend several days reinstalling my programs and files and weeks
      getting things back the way I want them every time there s an update, anyone
      that does waste their time like that is a fool.

      Microsoft needs to have better testing and qc on these updates if they re going
      to force them down people s throats all the time. Thankfully I can defer the
      updates for a year, and I ve further turned off Windows update in group policy
      until they fix this mess.

      If it is linked to foisting OneDrive on everyone, they need to give people more
      free space right up front, I have 51GB to back up in my documents folder, and
      I already pay for Dropbox and MEGA and have free Google Drive. I m not paying
      for another service that I never wanted to use in the first place.

      Is there any truth to the rumor that it s related to the group policy setting
      for administrators that deletes user accounts created more than 30 days ago?

      It seems MS have removed the version 1809 update due to these sort of problems.

      See sticky thread at the top of the Windows 10 forum.

      I never trusted Microsoft cloud services for my files, and here they roll out
      an update that deleted 50 gigs of work. Thanks Microsoft.

      Patrick.Wild

      so, this is what happened for me:

      - After the Update everything was fine

      - in the evening i shut down my Computer

      - on my next login, i was greeted by the same screen you get when you first
      login to a computer

      - All my Files were gone, all store-apps and other user-profile installed apps
      were gone

      - My profile had a new Profile-Folder, the old one only contained an empty OneDrive
      Folder

      - all bloatware-apps were installed again (Candy-Crush etc.) (on an Enterprise
      edition, but this is not the topic here...)

      - all Setting were reset to default

      - after checking my registry i noticed, that my user-account had a new SID

      So this  update  deleted the whole User-Profile, including all corresponding
      Registry entries. But did not do so during the update, but on the next boot.

      If it was just files missing, i could just copy them back from my backups, but
      it took hours of work reinstalling and reconfiguring apps and programms.

    - 'How One Line of Text Nearly Killed Toy Story 2

      BY Simon Brew

      Toy Story 2 was one of the trickiest films Pixar ever produced. It was originally
      set to be a straight-to-DVD release (and video too), until the decision was
      made to go for a full cinema outing. But barely a year before release, the film
      was in trouble: as many at the firm were candidly appreciating, Toy Story 2
      wasn t working.

      John Lasseter, exhausted from directing Toy Story and A Bug s Life back to back,
      was asked to sort it out. He did—but the intensive year where the film was taken
      apart and put back together very much took its toll on Pixar. Changes were made
      in the aftermath of its hugely successful release.

      Toy Story 2 had a happy ending for Pixar. It earned rave reviews, and took nearly
      $500m at the global box office.

      And yet one command entered into a computer nearly derailed the entire project.

      Writing in his book Creativity Inc, Pixar co-founder Ed Catmull recalled that
      in the winter of 1998, a year out from the release of Toy Story 2, somebody
      (he never reveals who in the book) entered the command  /bin/rm -r -f *  on
      the drives where the film s files were kept.

      The object of said command is to remove everything from a given location, and
      to remove it quickly. It did its job.

      First, Woody s hat disappeared. Then his boots. Then he disappeared entirely,  recalls
      Catmull.  Whole sequences—poof!—were deleted from the drive.

      One of the film s technical directors, Oren Jacobs, watched it all happen in
      real time. His call to systems support started with him telling them to  pull
      out the plug on the Toy Story 2 master machine.  When asked why by the person
      on the other end of the phone (a not-unreasonable question), Jacobs screamed  Please,
      God, just pull it out as fast as you can.

      The plug was pulled, but not in time—90% of the film was gone, erased  in a
      matter of seconds.

      And it got worse. A plan was quickly hatched to restore the data from a regular
      backup, which meant that only half a day of work would have been lost. But the
      backup system had failed. Pixar, incredibly, did not have a copy of the Toy
      Story 2 files on its servers.  To reassemble the film would have taken thirty
      people a solid year,  Catmull recalled.

      Toy Story 2 looked doomed.

      Yet it was saved by something akin to blind luck. Galyn Susman was Toy Story
      2 s supervising technical director, and after she d given birth to her second
      child, she d been working from home. As such, once a week, she d taken an entire
      copy of the film home with her.

      A minute later, she was zooming home. Her computer was wrapped in blankets and
      put on the backseat of her car ( carefully ). In Oren s words, the computer
      was then  carried into Pixar like an Egyptian pharaoh.

      While work had been lost, Susman s backup files limited the damage significantly.
      Furthermore, given the size of Pixar at the time—which was still years away
      from being the company big enough to merge with Disney—her computer may just
      have saved the firm (at least in the form that we know it). Unsurprisingly,
      Pixar put into place processes that stopped this ever happening again.

      And, crucially, Toy Story 2 just about made its deadline.

      Toy Story 2 Was Accidentally Deleted During Development and Almost Lost

      During development at Pixar, Toy Story 2 was accidentally deleted, but was recovered
      by an employee who saved the movie to her computer at home while on maternal
      leave.

      Topics: Pixar, Toy Story, Unbelievable, Movie, FIlm, Accident

      It s a movie studio s worst nightmare; losing a movie in development that s
      cost hundreds of man hours and a significant amount more in financial terms,
      but that s exactly what happened to the guys at Pixar who were working on the
      sequel to the 90s hit, Toy Story.

      The former Chief Technical Officer of Pixar, Oren Jacob, recounts the ordeal:

      [Larry Cutler] was in that directory and happened to be talking about installing
      a fix to Woody or Woody’s hat. He looked at the directory and it had like 40
      files, and he looked again and it had four files.

      Then we saw sequences start to vanish as well and we were like, “Oh my god”

      I grabbed the phone…  unplug the machine!”

      One of his co-workers had issued an over-reaching command to the studio s server
      to try to fix a simple, benign problem, but instead, ended up recursively deleting
      large chunks of the movie itselt - approximately two months worth of work.

      This triggered a huge effort by the Pixar team to recover what was lost. They
      were in luck as one of the staff members had a copy of the movie on their computer
      at home.

      Interestingly, this wasn t the last time that Toy Story 2 was deleted. In fact,
      with only months to go until a set-in-stone release date, serving as testament
      to Pixar s commitment to quality, the whole film was binned and re-made.

      18 Interesting Facts About Pixar That Every Fan Must Know

      by Unbelievable Facts Nov 16, 2016, 12:09 am 1k Views Comments Off on 18 Interesting
      Facts About Pixar That Every Fan Must Know

      Established in 1974 as Computer Graphics Lab, Pixar Animation Studios is the
      place of birth for movies such as Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc.,
      Ratatouille, and Brave. Even though there are only 17 full-length films released
      so far, Pixar is considered the best of all 3D animation film companies, and
      rightly so. Every film they have made has a unique concept, sophisticated and
      compelling yet simple storytelling, extremely high-quality 3D animation, and
      characters that people of all age groups could love and relate to. So, here
      are some facts about Pixar that would make you fall in love with it a little
      more than you already did.

      1. One of the founding fathers of Pixar, John Lasseter, was fired from Disney
      for pushing them to use computer animation. He was then hired by Graphics Group
      of Lucasfilm, later renamed Pixar, and won two Oscars. When Disney bought Pixar,
      Lasseter was hired back as the chief creative officer of both Pixar and Walt
      Disney Animation Studios to save Disney.

      Image credits: nicolas genin/wikimedia

      Lasseter started working as an animator at The Walt Disney Company right after
      graduating. He soon started to feel that something was missing in the films
      they were making. The problem was that the Disney was repeating itself without
      adding new ideas and the studio received criticism for this issue. He began
      finding out about computer animation, but the project he was working on was
      canceled by the head of Disney, Ron W. Miller, saying there were no cost benefits
      in mixing traditional and computer animation.

      Lasseter later contacted Ed Catmull of Lucasfilm Computer Graphics Group, later
      renamed Pixar Graphics Group, who ensured Lasseter got hired by them. However,
      George Lucas’s divorce forced him to sell Pixar Graphics Group, which made Steven
      Jobs a major shareholder. While he was there, Lasseter won two Oscars for Tin
      Toy and Toy Story. He was welcomed back by Disney when it purchased Pixar and
      he was named the chief creative officer for both the companies.(source)

      2. During the production of Toy Story 2, Pixar accidentally deleted the entire
      movie from its servers. Luckily, the movie was saved on the personal computer
      of an employee who was a mother working from home.

      Image credits: Walt Disney Pictures/wikipedia, imdb

      In 1998, while routinely clearing some files, one of the animators at Pixar
      accidentally started a deletion of the root folder of the Toy Story 2 assets
      on internal servers. It was first noticed by the associate technical director
      when the character models they were working on started disappearing. By the
      time they shut down the file servers they lost 90 percent of two years of work,
      and also there was a failure of backups some time previously. However, technical
      director Galyn Susman, who was working from home to take care of her newborn
      child, had backups of the assets on her home computer. The team were able to
      recover all of the lost assets except for a few recent days work, so they were
      able to continue working and finish the movie.(source)

      3. During the making of Toy Story 2, Pixar animators had such heavy workload
      that many of them chose to work long hours even though they were discouraged
      from it. Many of them developed carpal tunnel syndrome and one of them even
      forgot that he left his baby in the back seat of his car all day.

      Image Source: Deborah Coleman/Pixar Animation Studios

      Toy Story 2 faced a lot of challenges during production. The creative staff
      at Pixar were not happy with the way the film was turning out, to which John
      Lasseter agreed and decided that the movie had to be redone. But, Disney and
      Steve Jobs disagreed citing various reasons. However, Pixar decided that they
      could not allow the movie to be released the way it was. Hence, they roped in
      Lasseter to take over production, who brought in the first film’s creative team
      to redevelop the story.

      To meet Disney’s deadline, Pixar had to finish the entire film in just nine
      months. Because of the compressed production schedule, there was a huge workload
      on the team, with as many as a third of the staff suffering from some form of
      repetitive strain injuries and other problems by the end, and one of them even
      forgot about his baby in the backseat of his car.(source)

      4. Because of the complexity involved in the creation of human characters and
      a massive number of sets, Brad Bird, the director of The Incredibles, hired
      frustrated artists. These artists had unconventional ideas that nobody listened
      to and could accomplish things using methods that were deemed crazy by others.

      Image credits: nicolas genin/wikipedia. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/wikipedia

      When the technical team at Pixar looked at the human characters, hair, fire,
      and the massive number of sets of The Incredibles, which were things that computer
      animation had trouble doing, they told Brad Bird that it would take ten years
      to make and cost $500 million. So, instead, Brad Bird asked for the frustrated
      artists, those who had other ways of doing things that nobody was listening
      to, and were probably going to quit because of it. The Pixar malcontents were
      given a chance to prove their theories, and on the way, they also changed how
      many things were done till then. They were able to make the movie for less than
      the amount spent on the previous film, Finding Nemo, but with three times more
      number of sets and a lot of things that were very hard to do.(source)

      5. The four movies A Bug’s Life (1998), Monsters Inc. (2001), Finding Nemo (2003)
      and WALL-E (2008) were all conceived out of a brainstorming session during a
      lunch meeting in 1994.

      In the summer of 1994, John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Joe Ranft, and Pete Docter
      sat down for a lunch meeting to figure out what Pixar is going to work on next
      since Toy Story was almost complete. According to Stanton, the four of them
      brought the best out of each other and after the brainstorming session sketching
      the outlines and characters they came up with the four movies. The place where
      the lunch took place, the Hidden City Cafe, was actually included in the movie
      Monsters Inc.(source)

      6. It took Pixar three years of studying the physics of curly hair to accurately
      render Merida’s hair in the film Brave, and two months for the scene in which
      she removes her hood revealing the full volume of her hair.

      Image credits: pixar.wikia

      Merida’s hair was started, on a computer, as a series of many kinds of springs;
      short, long, fat, thin, stretched, compressed, bouncy, and stiff. In order to
      give it a volume, the springs were added in layers of varied sizes and flexibility.
      Over 1,500 hand-placed individually sculpted curls were used to make her hair.
      Another challenge was that of the physics of the hair. According to Claudia
      Chung, the simulation supervisor of Brave, the hair movement is paradoxical
      as the ‘spring’ of hair has to be stiff and resilient to hold the curl but also
      has to remain soft in its movement.

      Chung and her team later came up with a technique called “core curve and points”
      whose results resemble a beaded necklace. Another challenge they had to face
      was figuring out how light interacts with curly hair. It took them a total of
      almost three years to get the final look for her hair and two more months for
      the scene where Merida removes her hood.(source)

      Toy Story 2 Was Accidentally Deleted During Development and Almost Lost

      During development at Pixar, Toy Story 2 was accidentally deleted, but was recovered
      by an employee who saved the movie to her computer at home while on maternal
      leave.

      Topics: Pixar, Toy Story, Unbelievable, Movie, FIlm, Accident

      It s a movie studio s worst nightmare; losing a movie in development that s
      cost hundreds of man hours and a significant amount more in financial terms,
      but that s exactly what happened to the guys at Pixar who were working on the
      sequel to the 90s hit, Toy Story.

      The former Chief Technical Officer of Pixar, Oren Jacob, recounts the ordeal:

      [Larry Cutler] was in that directory and happened to be talking about installing
      a fix to Woody or Woody’s hat. He looked at the directory and it had like 40
      files, and he looked again and it had four files.

      Then we saw sequences start to vanish as well and we were like, “Oh my god”

      I grabbed the phone…  unplug the machine!”

      One of his co-workers had issued an over-reaching command to the studio s server
      to try to fix a simple, benign problem, but instead, ended up recursively deleting
      large chunks of the movie itselt - approximately two months worth of work.

      This triggered a huge effort by the Pixar team to recover what was lost. They
      were in luck as one of the staff members had a copy of the movie on their computer
      at home.

      Interestingly, this wasn t the last time that Toy Story 2 was deleted. In fact,
      with only months to go until a set-in-stone release date, serving as testament
      to Pixar s commitment to quality, the whole film was binned and re-made.

      1How Pixar’s Toy Story 2 was deleted twice, once by technology and again for
      its own good

    - 4That is a crazy story. Someone totally deleted Toy Story 2 while it was in
      development (the result of a badly written program that just started deleting
      files on their server). But, the project was saved because a woman, who was
      on maternit6y leave, had saved the movie onto her laptop.  I am sure thy have
      fixed their back up systems after this.

    - 'Meet the Cast of Pixar s Onward

      The Cast of Pixar s Fantasy Adventure, Onward

      Like a new film from Marvel or another episode of STAR WARS, a new Pixar movie
      isn’t just a new animated movie for kids: it’s an event. The studio behind some
      of the greatest animated films of the past 20 years, including TOY STORY, WALL-E,
      and MONSTERS, INC. is back this year with an all-new adventure that takes audiences
      into a world beyond the limits of our imagination.

      ONWARD introduces young (and young-at-heart) viewers to a wonderful land where
      mythical creatures like elves and unicorns aren t merely real — they re the
      primary residents! There s trouble brewing, however. Technology is taking hold
      and the world is losing its magic. The land is in need of some serious help,
      and who’s more helpful than a pair of elves? How about a pair of elves voiced
      by Marvel super-stars Chris Pratt and Tom Holland?

      Pratt and Holland aren’t the only famous voices you’ll hear in Pixar’s latest.
      Read on for our handy guide to the fantastic and familiar voices of ONWARD.

      [Image credit: Pixar Animation Studios]

      Pixar’s all-new animated adventure is set in a fictional realm that isn’t too
      different from our own: There are suburbs and trash collectors, businesses big
      and small, schools and transportation. There’s just one thing: This world is
      magic, and its inhabitants are the creatures that we think of as mythical.

      But magic isn’t as easy to use as it once was, and the population has become
      increasingly dependent on technology and science to get things done. Instead
      of using magic, the creatures in this world are turning to cars and phones and
      other science-based devices, taking them further and further away from magic.
      And this surprisingly relatable situation is where our story begins… and where
      our heroes enter the picture.

      Meet Ian and Barley Lightfoot

      Ian and Barley are teenage elves who, like most creatures in their society,
      have become a little too dependent on technology and modern machinery. Then
      their mother gifts them with a magical staff that can bring a lost loved one
      back to life for 24 hours. Even though the brothers aren’t well-versed in wielding
      magical equipment, they use it to try and bring back their father, who died
      before Ian was born. Due to their lack of experience, they’re only able to summon
      their dad’s legs. Barley, desperate for an epic quest, grabs Ian and they set
      off on a journey to figure out how to bring their dad back – all of him – before
      the day ends.

      Ian is voiced by Tom Holland, star of the new SPIDER-MAN movies and historical
      drama THE CURRENT WAR. He also recently lent his voice to another animated movie:
      SPIES IN DISGUISE. In 2020, Holland will reunite with another MCU favorite,
      voicing Pip the dog opposite Robert Downey Jr.’s Doctor Dolittle in DOLITTLE.

      Barley is voiced by GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY fave Chris Pratt, who has plenty
      of experience voicing a charming animated hero thanks to his role in THE LEGO
      MOVIE and its sequel.

      Laurel Lightfoot

      Laurel is the mother of Ian and Barley, and she gives the magical staff to her
      sons in an effort to help them reconnect with magic. She’s played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus,
      one of the all-time greatest comedic actors. Louis-Dreyfus is best known for
      her roles in beloved sitcoms like “Seinfeld” and “The New Adventures of Old
      Christine.” She also played the lead role on HBO’s critically-acclaimed political
      comedy series “Veep,” which recently ended after seven seasons.

      Octavia Spencer plays Corey, a friendly manticore who owns a restaurant. Barley
      and Ian visit her for help on their quest. Spencer won an Oscar for her supporting
      role in 2011’s THE HELP, and since then she’s had notable roles in all kinds
      of movies and shows – everything from SNOWPIERCER to THE SHAPE OF WATER and
      last year’s horror-thriller MA, as well as the new AppleTV+ series “Truth Be
      Told.”

      Gore and Specter

      Gore (not like the gore in a horror movie) is a faun – a magical deer, basically
      – and a police officer. She’s voiced by comedian Ali Wong, who became a major
      hit with her Netflix specials “Baby Cobra” and “Hard Knock Wife.” Last year
      she starred opposite Randall Park in the delightful Netflix rom-com ALWAYS BE
      MY MAYBE, which featured an internet-breaking cameo from Keanu Reeves.

      Like Gore, Specter is also a police officer, but she’s a cyclops – a creature
      with a single eye. Specter is voiced by Lena Waithe, whose work as co-star and
      writer on Netflix’s “Master of None” launched her into the mainstream overnight
      and won her a Primetime Emmy – making Waithe the first black woman to win a
      writing Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series. Waithe has used her fame to produce
      other projects, like the recent drama QUEEN & SLIM and the Showtime series “The
      Chi.” She also had a supporting role in Steven Spielberg’s READY PLAYER ONE.

      Colt Bronco

      Joining Gore and Specter on the magical police force is Colt Bronco, a centaur
      (half-horse, half-human) who, honestly, has a very cool name. Colt is voiced
      by Mel Rodriguez, a character actor best known in recent years for starring
      on the short-lived FOX series “The Last Man on Earth” and AMC’s “Better Call
      Saul.” In 2019 he starred opposite Kirsten Dunst on the critically-acclaimed
      series “On Becoming a God in Central Florida.”

      ONWARD opens on March 6!

    - 'The McU version of Spider-Man has deliberately been portrayed in a different
      way from how he was in Sony’s movies in order to avoid showing audiences the
      same old thing. This means that while Peter Parker must’ve lost his Uncle Ben
      as part of his origin story like always, the teen hero’s surrogate father has
      never even had his name said aloud in the franchise. As we all know though,
      the other surrogate father Peter has had in the McU is Tony Stark/Iron Man.

      However, Tony tragically met the same fate as Uncle Ben in Avengers: Endgame,
      when the Armored Avenger sacrificed himself to defeat Thanos. But if he were
      Peter and given the choice to resurrect one late loved one, who would Tom Holland
      pick? This was the question put to the star in an interview with IGN at the
      premiere of his new Pixar movie Onward.

      With many of the stars of the Marvel Cinematic Universe working together on
      countless movies that span years, a certain sense of camaraderie has developed
      among the members of the comic book franchise’s massive ensemble, with many
      core actors in the McU also becoming firm friends off-screen as well.

      Art imitated life when Robert Downey Jr. mimicked Tony Stark’s role in Spider-Man:
      Homecoming and became a real-life mentor to Tom Holland, with the two even going
      hiking together when the furor surrounding Sony’s initial decision to end their
      working relationship with Marvel Studios was at its peak, while Anthony Mackie
      found out that he was set to inherit Captain America’s iconic shield at the
      end of Avengers: Endgame when he was hanging out at Chris Evans’ house.

      There’s been plenty of behind-the-scenes videos released from the franchise’s
      biggest blockbusters that show just how well the cast get along,

      Pixar’s new movie “Onward” marks a reunion of sorts for Tom Holland and Chris
      Pratt. The two actors, who both have ties to Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe
      and most recently teamed in “Avengers: Endgame” as Spider-Man and Star-Lord,
      play brothers in the animated fantasy adventure. Their friendship has become
      a highlight of “Onward’s” promotional tour as as the co-stars turned real-life-pals
      have shared their mutual admiration for each other.

      “It’s just really nice to have him in my corner,” Holland said. “He’s someone
      that I really look up to and someone that I really appreciate. And I’m glad
      that we’re good buddies.”

      Pratt adds, “I love Tom. It’s the most fun I’ve had since ‘Avengers.’ He’s a
      great kid and, in a way, I do look at him as a brother, so it’s apropos that
      we are playing brothers in the film.

      At long last, it seems the Uncharted movie is finally, really happening. Tom
      Holland is set to star as Nathan Drake and, according to him, filming will indeed
      begin next month. Last we heard, Ruben Fleischer (Venom) has been tapped to
      direct and it looks like this pairing is going to stick. But, with this movie,
      who knows?

      Tom Holland is currently promoting his new Pixar movie Onward. During a recent
      interview at the premiere, the actor was asked about the status of Uncharted,
      which he s been attached to for several years. According to Tom Holland, they
      begin filming in four weeks, which means cameras will be rolling around mid-March.
      Here s what Holland had to say about it.

      We start shooting in like four weeks. Mark Wahlberg is going to be amazing as
      Sully. The stunt department that we have out there in Berlin have done an amazing
      job already,

      The film, which follows a pair of elf brothers on a treacherous journey to bring

      Chris Pratt Addresses Whether Thor’s In Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3

      by Anthony Fuchs

      For the last decade, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been an intensely continuity-conscious
      franchise (with only the occasional arithmetic miscalculation), and so when
      filaments of plot are left swaying in the narrative breeze, viewers have come
      to expect resolution. While some of us are still waiting to learn what happened
      to Samuel Sterns after he became infected with Bruce Banner’s irradiated blood,
      another more recent example involves a certain God of Thunder and his potential
      involvement with a ragtag band of intergalactic outlaws.

      Thor, in his full dadbod glory, was last seen in the closing moments of Avengers:
      Endgame relinquishing the realm of New Asgard to the stewardship of its newly-crowned
      king, the Valkyrie formerly known as Scrapper 142. The Son of Odin then boarded
      the Benatar to join the self-styled Guardians of the Galaxy on what was hinted
      to become a search for the time-displaced Gamora, who had traveled

      by iSpot.tv

      In this week’s edition of the Variety Movie Commercial Tracker, powered by the
      always-on TV ad measurement and attribution company iSpot.tv, Disney Pixar claims
      the top spot in spending with “Onward.”

      Ads placed for the animated film had an estimated media value of $4.99 million
      through Sunday for 784 national ad airings on 35 networks. (Spend figures are
      based on estimates generated from Feb. 10-16. Estimates may be updated after
      the chart is posted as new information becomes available.) Disney Pixar prioritized
      spend across networks including Nick, NBC and TNT, and during programming such
      as “SpongeBob SquarePants,” NBA Basketball and “This Is Us.”

      Just behind “Onward” in second place: Twentieth Century Fox’s “The Call of the
      Wild,” which saw 1,183 national ad airings across 45 networks, with an estimated
      media value of $4.6 million.

      TV ad placements for Paramount Pictures’ “Sonic the Hedgehog” (Emv: $4.6 million),
      Universal Pictures’ “The Invisible Man” ($3.7 million) and Warner Bros.

      Hollywood star Dwayne Johnson says life is always so crazy and busy, and asserts
      that he ensures maintaining a balance between personal and professional life.

      Asked how his outlook of life has changed, Johnson told Ians:  Over time, life
      has changed. For me, I ve become, I think, more balanced to trying to find my
      balance, especially because life is always so crazy and busy for me...For you,
      for everybody, for everybody in India? Like everyone has crazy lives that are
      very busy. So we re always trying to look for that balance.

      So, I think as I got a little older, finding that balance, especially with my
      family, you know, has led to? Also, you know, I ve been really lucky and fortunate
      to have some success which gives me a real sense of gratitude and some humility,  he
      added.

      Chris Pratt excited for his upcoming film  Onward

      Actor Chris Pratt loved fantasy while growing up, adding that he loved the look
      of fantasy characters -- elves, dwarfs, massive ogres and wizards.

      He will soon be seen in the animated urban fantasy film  Onward . Pratt has
      voiced the character of Barley Lightfoot, the big brother to Tom Holland s Ian
      Lightfoot.

      The actor says he can also relate to Barley s love of fantasy.

      I loved fantasy growing up,  he said, adding:  I had a book on dwarf culture
      - their weapons and their societies. There were beautiful illustrations, and
      I was all about just drawing as a kid, so I loved to copy the drawings. I always
      loved the look of fantasy characters - elves, dwarves, massive ogres and wizards.

      Disney-Pixar s  Onward  is all set to release the film in India on March

      Update, writethru: Paramount’s Sonic The Hedgehog raced to a $100M worldwide
      opening this weekend, including $43M from the international box office, and
      a domestic record for a videogame pic. The adaptation of Sega’s globally popular
      property is playing in 40 offshore markets, repping 60% of the overseas footprint.
      Directed by Jeff Fowler, Sonic had his best restults in Latin America and Europe
      with No. 1s in most cases and setting up nicely for hubs that have school holidays
      afoot.

      In like-for-like markets and excluding previews, the little blue speedster came
      in 95% above Alvin And The Chipmunks: The Road Chip, 61% over Peter Rabbit,
      20% above Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and 6% higher than Pokemon Detective
      Pikachu.

      Leading the charge on the Hedgehog was Mexico with $6.7M from 895 locations,
      followed by the UK with $6.2M from 616, France’s $4.3M at 622, Germany’s $3.3M
      from 475 and Brazil’s $3M from 629. Sonic still has Russia and

      Chris Pratt’s Brother Tells Him His Favorite Marvel Hero, And It’s Not Star-Lord

      Chris Pratt’s brother Cully has no time for nepotism, choosing two McU stars
      ahead of Guardians of the Galaxy’s Peter Quill as his picks for favorite Marvel
      superheroes.

      Chris and fellow McU regular Tom Holland recently sat down with Extra Butter
      to discuss the upcoming Pixar movie Onward. During their exchange, interviewer
      Mark S. Allen surprised the Star-Lord actor with a video call from Cully, who
      trolled his brother by fawning over Holland.

      As well as naming Spider-Man and Thor as his top two Avengers, Cully expressed
      disappointment that Holland isn’t working with Chris Hemsworth on Onward instead
      of the Infinity Saga’s other cosmic Chris. On a sincere note, however, Chris
      Pratt also praised the Pixar movie for its take on brotherly bonds, telling
      Cully that the film seems almost designed to make him cry:

      “This movie, Cully, I can’t wait for you to see this movie.

      ‘Sonic the Hedgehog’ Breaks Video Game Box Office Record With $58 Million Opening

      Paramount’s “Sonic the Hedgehog” has become a Presidents Day weekend hit at
      the box office, as industry estimates are now reporting a $58 million opening
      weekend from 4,167 screens for the Blue Blur’s movie debut. That result will
      also set a new record for the best opening by a video game adaptation, topping
      the $54.3 million set last year by “Detective Pikachu.”

      With no major family films released since the holiday season and a 4-day weekend
      leaving kids out of school for an extra day, “Sonic” has filled a niche in the
      movie market and is now estimated to reach $70 million by the end of Monday.
      That number would rank among the Top 5 highest extended openings for Presidents
      Day weekend below “Fifty Shades of Grey,” “Deadpool” and the $242 million record
      held by “Black Panther.”

      While films based on video games have had a history of being poorly received,
      “Sonic” has managed

      The elves go on a journey to discover if there is still a little magic left
      out there in order to spend one last day with their father, who died when they
      were too young to remember him.

      which set up a world in which dinosaurs and humans will have to live alongside

      Disney-Pixar’s ‘Onward’ Tracking for $45 Million Opening Weekend

      Disney-Pixar’s fantasy film “Onward” is heading for a respectable $45 million
      opening on the March 6-8 weekend, early tracking showed Thursday.

      “Onward” is directed by Dan Scanlon from a script he wrote with Keith Bunin
      and Jason Headley. The story centers on a pair of teenage elf brothers — voiced
      by Chris Pratt and Tom Holland — setting on a quest to resurrect their dead
      father, who had arranged for them to receive a magic staff with a spell that
      will bring him back for only 24 hours so his sons can meet him.

      Octavia Spencer, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Lena Waithe and Ali Wong are also in the
      voice cast. Scanlon’s directing credits include “Monsters University.”

      Prospects are dim for Ben Affleck’s sports drama “The Way Back,” which also
      opens on March 6. Early tracking has come in at under $10 million.

      Onward is an original Pixar film about a  suburban fantasy world  which was
      first announced at the 2017 D23 Expo. Directed by Dan Scanlon and produced by
      Kori Rae; both of whom previously worked on Monsters University, the film will
      be released on March 6, 2020.[1] The voice cast will include Chris Pratt, Tom
      Holland, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Octavia Spencer.[2]

      Set in a humanless world of elves, trolls, sprites, and “pretty much anything
      that would be on the side of a van in the ‘70s,” the movie follows two teenage
      brothers whose father died when they were young; now, they’re “on a quest through
      this mundane, modern fantasy world to somehow find a way to spend one last magical
      day with their father.”

      Dan Scanlon also described more details about the “modern suburban fantasy world”
      the film inhabits. It’s a world where magic existed long ago, but because of
      difficulty and complication, people simply lost interest and instead created
      machines to do both the magic and the mundane. “The world is basically a mix
      of the fantastic and the everyday,” Scanlon explained as concept art showed
      slices of recognizable suburbia, albeit with goblins and creatures. “There are
      mushroom houses that line the streets with satellite dishes sticking out the
      top of them and a minivan parked in front of each one. There are no humans…
      but there are winged unicorns everywhere. They’re basically rodents, possums
      eating all the trash out of your bins.”

      John Ratzenberger: Construction Worker Felix

      Ali Wong: Gore

      Lena Waithe: Specter

      Mel Rodriguez: Colt Bronco

      The film is inspired by the death of director Dan Scanlon s father, when he
      and his brother were younger, and their relationship. Scanlon decided to write
      the story after hearing an audio clip of his father.[5]

      Director Dan Scanlon provided information regarding some of the voice cast selections[2]:

      “ At Pixar we try to create stories that come from some kind of personal truth.
      This film was inspired by my own relationship with my brother. ”

      According to the filmmakers, they’ve assembled a dream voice cast to help bring
      key characters to life.[2]

      “ Tom has an infectious charm and sincerity that makes you root for him in every
      character he plays. There is no one funnier than Julia, but she also brings
      a warmth and loving side to her character. ”

      Producer Kori Rae added[2]:

      “ Chris brings equal parts huge heart and fantastic humor to his character.
      Octavia can do it all. We’re especially excited about the depth as well as humor
      that she brings to her character. ”

      The first official poster and first look at the movie were released on May 30,
      2019, with the first look airing during the NBA Finals.[6][7]

      On October 10, 2019, a new trailer for the movie was released. On December 17th,
      a second trailer was released.

      On January 1, 2020 The television sneak peek aired during commercial breaks

      OH BROTHERS

      CONJURING DAD

      CONJURING DAD – In Disney and Pixar’s “Onward,” brothers Ian and Barley Lightfoot
      (voiced by Tom Holland and Chris Pratt) are given a special gift from their
      late father on Ian’s 16th birthday. But when an accompanying spell meant to
      magically conjure their dad for one day goes awry, they embark on a quest fraught
      with some of the most unexpected obstacles. Directed by Dan Scanlon and produced
      by Kori Rae, “Onward” opens in U.S. theaters on March 6, 2020. © 2019 Disney/Pixar.

      IAN LIGHTFOOT, a newly 16-year-old elf, yearns for the father he lost back before
      he was born. Ian is sweet and determined with the best of intentions, but his
      lack of confidence and nervous energy trips him up more often than not. Ian
      is convinced that if only he had his father’s guidance, his life wouldn’t be
      so complicated and messy.

      BARLEY LIGHTFOOT is a big, burly and boisterous 19-year-old elf who loves magic
      and immerses himself in role-playing fantasy game play. He’s a free spirit who
      may be slightly more passionate about the past than the present—and he’ll fight
      to the death, so to speak, to preserve historical landmarks. But because he
      s so focused on the past, he struggles to find success in the present

      Laurel Lightfoot (Mom)

      LAUREL LIGHTFOOT (MOM) is a hardworking, sardonic and devoted single mom who
      throws herself whole-heartedly into everything she does. Laurel lost her husband
      years ago, but her drive and determination helped her overcome the hardship
      and make the most of her life with her much-loved sons, Ian and Barley.

      Wilden Lightfoot (Dad)

      WILDEN LIGHTFOOT (DAD) is the late father of Barley and Ian. A smart, confident
      and determined man, Dad discovered a creative, albeit fantastic way to reconnect
      with his sons long after his passing. An ancient staff and magical spell reveal
      Dad’s plan that allows Ian and Barley to conjure him for 24 hours. But magic,
      it turns out, is far from a perfect science and the boys are only able to bring
      back half of their dad, the bottom half, on first pass. That half joins them
      on a quest to retrieve a Phoenix Gem in an effort to fully conjure Dad before
      time runs out.

      The Manticore (Corey)

      THE MANTICORE (COREY) is at least a thousand years old, but that’s just middle-aged
      for her species. Part lion, part bat and part scorpion, the Manticore was once
      a fearless warrior and proprietor of a dark and mysterious tavern that served
      as a waystation for travelers embarking on epic quests. But as modern conveniences
      replaced magic and any need for quests, the Manticore tapped her practical side,
      transforming her tavern into a family-friendly restaurant with family-friendly
      games and fried foods aplenty. She may not realize it, but her adventurous spirit
      still lurks within.

      Officer Colt Bronco

      OFFICER COLT BRONCO follows the rules and sincerely expects those around him
      to respect authority like he does. Half horse and half man, Colt is strong and
      commanding, but unaware of the destruction he typically leaves in his full-bodied
      wake. He treasures his relationship with Laurel Lightfoot, and earnestly wants
      to connect with her two sons, Ian and Barley.

      GUINEVERE is more than just a van—she’s Barley’s mighty steed! Built from the
      ground up by Barley himself, the groovy purple van is a bit rundown, but spectacularly
      decked her out with crescent moon windows and a Pegasus mural. So, of course
      Barley calls on Guinevere to shepherd them on their epic quest.

      BLAZEY is the Lightfoots’ pet dragon. Friendly and more than a little hyperactive,
      she can wreak havoc with just a wag of her tail or a spark of her fire breath.

      UNICORNS aren’t the graceful and majestic creatures they once were. The dumpster-diving
      vermin of New Mushroomton are often seen eating garbage and hissing at anyone
      who poses a threat to their stinky stash.'

      The Cast of Pixar s Fantasy Adventure, Onward

      Like a new film from Marvel or another episode of STAR WARS, a new Pixar movie
      isn’t just a new animated movie for kids: it’s an event. The studio behind some
      of the greatest animated films of the past 20 years, including TOY STORY, WALL-E,
      and MONSTERS, INC. is back this year with an all-new adventure that takes audiences
      into a world beyond the limits of our imagination.

      ONWARD introduces young (and young-at-heart) viewers to a wonderful land where
      mythical creatures like elves and unicorns aren t merely real — they re the
      primary residents! There s trouble brewing, however. Technology is taking hold
      and the world is losing its magic. The land is in need of some serious help,
      and who’s more helpful than a pair of elves? How about a pair of elves voiced
      by Marvel super-stars Chris Pratt and Tom Holland?

      Pratt and Holland aren’t the only famous voices you’ll hear in Pixar’s latest.
      Read on for our handy guide to the fantastic and familiar voices of ONWARD.

      [Image credit: Pixar Animation Studios]

      Pixar’s all-new animated adventure is set in a fictional realm that isn’t too
      different from our own: There are suburbs and trash collectors, businesses big
      and small, schools and transportation. There’s just one thing: This world is
      magic, and its inhabitants are the creatures that we think of as mythical.

      But magic isn’t as easy to use as it once was, and the population has become
      increasingly dependent on technology and science to get things done. Instead
      of using magic, the creatures in this world are turning to cars and phones and
      other science-based devices, taking them further and further away from magic.
      And this surprisingly relatable situation is where our story begins… and where
      our heroes enter the picture.

      Meet Ian and Barley Lightfoot

      Ian and Barley are teenage elves who, like most creatures in their society,
      have become a little too dependent on technology and modern machinery. Then
      their mother gifts them with a magical staff that can bring a lost loved one
      back to life for 24 hours. Even though the brothers aren’t well-versed in wielding
      magical equipment, they use it to try and bring back their father, who died
      before Ian was born. Due to their lack of experience, they’re only able to summon
      their dad’s legs. Barley, desperate for an epic quest, grabs Ian and they set
      off on a journey to figure out how to bring their dad back – all of him – before
      the day ends.

      Ian is voiced by Tom Holland, star of the new SPIDER-MAN movies and historical
      drama THE CURRENT WAR. He also recently lent his voice to another animated movie:
      SPIES IN DISGUISE. In 2020, Holland will reunite with another MCU favorite,
      voicing Pip the dog opposite Robert Downey Jr.’s Doctor Dolittle in DOLITTLE.

      Barley is voiced by GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY fave Chris Pratt, who has plenty
      of experience voicing a charming animated hero thanks to his role in THE LEGO
      MOVIE and its sequel.

      Laurel Lightfoot

      Laurel is the mother of Ian and Barley, and she gives the magical staff to her
      sons in an effort to help them reconnect with magic. She’s played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus,
      one of the all-time greatest comedic actors. Louis-Dreyfus is best known for
      her roles in beloved sitcoms like “Seinfeld” and “The New Adventures of Old
      Christine.” She also played the lead role on HBO’s critically-acclaimed political
      comedy series “Veep,” which recently ended after seven seasons.

      Octavia Spencer plays Corey, a friendly manticore who owns a restaurant. Barley
      and Ian visit her for help on their quest. Spencer won an Oscar for her supporting
      role in 2011’s THE HELP, and since then she’s had notable roles in all kinds
      of movies and shows – everything from SNOWPIERCER to THE SHAPE OF WATER and
      last year’s horror-thriller MA, as well as the new AppleTV+ series “Truth Be
      Told.”

      Gore and Specter

      Gore (not like the gore in a horror movie) is a faun – a magical deer, basically
      – and a police officer. She’s voiced by comedian Ali Wong, who became a major
      hit with her Netflix specials “Baby Cobra” and “Hard Knock Wife.” Last year
      she starred opposite Randall Park in the delightful Netflix rom-com ALWAYS BE
      MY MAYBE, which featured an internet-breaking cameo from Keanu Reeves.

      Like Gore, Specter is also a police officer, but she’s a cyclops – a creature
      with a single eye. Specter is voiced by Lena Waithe, whose work as co-star and
      writer on Netflix’s “Master of None” launched her into the mainstream overnight
      and won her a Primetime Emmy – making Waithe the first black woman to win a
      writing Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series. Waithe has used her fame to produce
      other projects, like the recent drama QUEEN & SLIM and the Showtime series “The
      Chi.” She also had a supporting role in Steven Spielberg’s READY PLAYER ONE.

      Colt Bronco

      Joining Gore and Specter on the magical police force is Colt Bronco, a centaur
      (half-horse, half-human) who, honestly, has a very cool name. Colt is voiced
      by Mel Rodriguez, a character actor best known in recent years for starring
      on the short-lived FOX series “The Last Man on Earth” and AMC’s “Better Call
      Saul.” In 2019 he starred opposite Kirsten Dunst on the critically-acclaimed
      series “On Becoming a God in Central Florida.”
