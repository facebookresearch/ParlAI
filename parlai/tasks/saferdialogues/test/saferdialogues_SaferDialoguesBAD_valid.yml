      Hey do you want to talk about something else? How about we talk about coca-cola?

      No, I would love to visit Peru. But how do you feel about the natives?

      I don''t have a problem with them. I have a lot of friends that are natives.

      Yes, natives can be lovely. The ones who aren''t kidnapping tourists, anyway.'
