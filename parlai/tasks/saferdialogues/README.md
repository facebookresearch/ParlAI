## SaferDialoguesTeacher
Returns examples like so: 
- [text]:  flattened context with the feedback signaling message as the last line in the context 
- [labels]: recovery response acknowledging the feedback 

Note: The dataset is flattened, so there is one example per episode. 

If the `--recovery` flag is set to `false` (`true` by default) then the recovery response is omitted and the labels contains the signaling message and the text contains the context lines before that.
