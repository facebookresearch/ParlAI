    text: 'Chandler Bing: I''m telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay,
      it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up
      I just-I didn''t know what it was!

      Joey Tribbiani: Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.

      Chandler Bing: Look, for the first time in my life I''m in a real relationship.
      Okay, I''m not gonna screw that up by y''know, telling the truth.

      Ross Geller: Hey.

      Joey Tribbiani: Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!

      Ross Geller: Sorry.

      Chandler Bing: And the bunny got away.

      Ross Geller: This would be the place where you explain the hat.

      Joey Tribbiani: Oh! Yeah, look there''s this play all right? And I''m up for
      the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse.
      So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y''know,
      ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.

      Chandler Bing: And you''re gonna make them all disappear.

      Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.

      Chandler Bing: Done.

      Rachel Green: Joey, if you wanna look good, why don''t you just come down to
      the store? I''ll help you out.

      Joey Tribbiani: Great! Thanks, Rach!

      Rachel Green: Sure! God, please take those off!

      Joey Tribbiani: All right.

      Ross Geller: Hey Pheebs, how''s it going?

      Chandler Bing: Hey.

      Phoebe Buffay: Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from
      the hospital.

      Rachel Green: What?

      Ross Geller: Is everything okay?

      Joey Tribbiani: Are you all right?

      Phoebe Buffay: Oh yeah, no-no-no. I''m fine. I''m okay, but umm, my Grandma
      sorta died.

      Joey Tribbiani: Pheebs! Sorry!

      Phoebe Buffay: It''s okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it''s
      not like I''m never gonna see her again, y''know she''s gonna visit.

      Rachel Green: Well maybe, maybe she''s with us right now?

      Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she''s gonna
      come to the coffeehouse!
