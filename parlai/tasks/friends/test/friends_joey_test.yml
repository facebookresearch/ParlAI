      Ross Geller: Totally.

      Rachel Green: Ross, you don''t seem okay.

      Ross Geller: I''m sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone
      would feel better if we had some flan.

      Charlie Wheeler: Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.

      Ross Geller: No!

      Charlie Wheeler: I''m sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but
      this has been lovely.

      Ross Geller: Wasn''t it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that
      you never really liked Rachel.

      Charlie Wheeler: You''re on fire! I''ll call you in the morning, okay?

      Ross Geller: Okay.

      Charlie Wheeler: Alright.

      Charlie Wheeler: God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..

      Rachel Green: Oh, that''s okay, girls tend not to like me.

      Charlie Wheeler: Bye.

      Ross Geller: Okay, I guess it''s just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!

      Rachel Green: You know what, Ross? I think we''re gonna take off too.

      Ross Geller: Oh, oh. Of course. God, I''m so stupid. You guys are a couple now.
      I mean, you probably just want to be alone.

      Rachel Green: No, no, it''s just that it''s getting late...

      Ross Geller: Hey, hey, it''s fine. It''s totally fine. We''ve got plenty of
      margaritas. It''s all good.

      Ross Geller: I don''t even know what that''s for.
