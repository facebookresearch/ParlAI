      it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up

      Joey Tribbiani: Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.

      Chandler Bing: Look, for the first time in my life I''m in a real relationship.
      Okay, I''m not gonna screw that up by y''know, telling the truth.

      Ross Geller: Hey.

      Joey Tribbiani: Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!

      Ross Geller: Sorry.

      Chandler Bing: And the bunny got away.
