      Joey Tribbiani: Oh! Yeah, look there''s this play all right? And I''m up for
      the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse.
      So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y''know,
      ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.

      Chandler Bing: And you''re gonna make them all disappear.

      Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.

      Chandler Bing: Done.

      Rachel Green: Joey, if you wanna look good, why don''t you just come down to
      the store? I''ll help you out.

      Joey Tribbiani: Great! Thanks, Rach!

      Rachel Green: Sure! God, please take those off!

      Joey Tribbiani: All right.
