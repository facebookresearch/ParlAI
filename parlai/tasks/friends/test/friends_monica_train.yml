      the one I''m sad about. Y''know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with
      Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don''t think I''m handling it all
      that well.

      Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, maybe.

      Rachel Green: And I-I am just trying to figure out why.

      Phoebe Buffay: Any luck?

      Rachel Green: Well, yeah, y''know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on
      again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would
      be on again.
