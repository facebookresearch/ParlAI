      Ross Geller: I''m sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone
      would feel better if we had some flan.

      Charlie Wheeler: Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.

      Ross Geller: No!

      Charlie Wheeler: I''m sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but
      this has been lovely.

      Ross Geller: Wasn''t it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that
      you never really liked Rachel.

      Charlie Wheeler: You''re on fire! I''ll call you in the morning, okay?

      Ross Geller: Okay.

      Charlie Wheeler: Alright.
