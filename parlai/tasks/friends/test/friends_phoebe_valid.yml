    text: 'Chandler Bing: I''m telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay,
      it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up
      I just-I didn''t know what it was!

      Joey Tribbiani: Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.

      Chandler Bing: Look, for the first time in my life I''m in a real relationship.
      Okay, I''m not gonna screw that up by y''know, telling the truth.

      Ross Geller: Hey.

      Joey Tribbiani: Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!

      Ross Geller: Sorry.

      Chandler Bing: And the bunny got away.

      Ross Geller: This would be the place where you explain the hat.

      Joey Tribbiani: Oh! Yeah, look there''s this play all right? And I''m up for
      the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse.
      So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y''know,
      ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.

      Chandler Bing: And you''re gonna make them all disappear.

      Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.

      Chandler Bing: Done.

      Rachel Green: Joey, if you wanna look good, why don''t you just come down to
      the store? I''ll help you out.

      Joey Tribbiani: Great! Thanks, Rach!

      Rachel Green: Sure! God, please take those off!
