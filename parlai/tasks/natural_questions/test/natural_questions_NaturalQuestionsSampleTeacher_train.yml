      , Persephone ( / pərˈsɛfəni / ; Greek : Περσεφόνη ) , also called Kore ( / ˈkɔːriː
      / ; `` the maiden '''' ) , is the daughter of Zeus and Demeter and is the queen
      of the underworld . Homer describes her as the formidable , venerable majestic
      princess of the underworld , who carries into effect the curses of men upon
      the souls of the dead . Persephone was married to Hades , the god of the underworld
      . The myth of her abduction represents her function as the personification of
      vegetation , which shoots forth in spring and withdraws into the earth after
      harvest ; hence , she is also associated with spring as well as the fertility
      of vegetation . Similar myths appear in the Orient , in the cults of male gods
      like Attis , Adonis , and Osiris , and in Minoan Crete . </P> <P> Persephone
      as a vegetation goddess and her mother Demeter were the central figures of the
      Eleusinian mysteries , which promised the initiated a more enjoyable prospect
      after death . In some versions , Persephone is the mother of Zeus ''s sons Dionysus
      , Iacchus , or Zagreus . The origins of her cult are uncertain , but it was
      based on very old agrarian cults of agricultural communities . </P> <P> Persephone
      was commonly worshipped along with Demeter and with the same mysteries . To
      her alone were dedicated the mysteries celebrated at Athens in the month of
      Anthesterion . In Classical Greek art , Persephone is invariably portrayed robed
      , often carrying a sheaf of grain . She may appear as a mystical divinity with
      a sceptre and a little box , but she was mostly represented in the process of
      being carried off by Hades . </P> <P> In Roman mythology , she is called Proserpina
      , and her mother , Ceres and her father Jupiter . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul>

      the deceased woman '''' holding a pomegranate . Etruscan terracotta cinerary
      statue . National archaeological museum in Palermo , Italy <P> In a Linear B
      ( Mycenean Greek ) inscription on a tablet found at Pylos dated 1400 -- 1200
      BC , John Chadwick reconstructed the name of a goddess * Preswa who could be
      identified with Persa , daughter of Oceanus and found speculative the further
      identification with the first element of Persephone . Persephonē ( Greek : Περσεφόνη
      ) is her name in the Ionic Greek of epic literature . The Homeric form of her
      name is Persephoneia ( Περσεφονεία , Persephoneia ) . In other dialects , she
      was known under variant names : Persephassa ( Περσεφάσσα ) , Persephatta ( Περσεφάττα
      ) , or simply Korē ( Κόρη , `` girl , maiden '''' ) . Plato calls her Pherepapha
      ( Φερέπαφα ) in his Cratylus , `` because she is wise and touches that which
      is in motion '''' . There are also the forms Periphona ( Πηριφόνα ) and Phersephassa
      ( Φερσέφασσα ) . The existence of so many different forms shows how difficult
      it was for the Greeks to pronounce the word in their own language and suggests
      that the name may have a Pre-Greek origin . </P> <P> Persephatta ( Περσεφάττα
      ) is considered to mean `` female thresher of grain '''' ; the first constituent
      of the name originates in Proto - Greek `` perso - '''' ( related to Sanskrit
      `` parṣa - '''' ) , `` sheaf of grain '''' and the second constituent of the
      name originates in Proto - Indo European * - gwn - t - ih , from the root *
      gwhen - `` to strike '''' . </P> <P> An alternative etymology is from φέρειν
      φόνον , pherein phonon , `` to bring ( or cause ) death '''' . </P> <H3> Roman
      Proserpina ( edit ) </H3> Cinerary altar with tabula representing the rape of
      Proserpina . White marble , Antonine Era , 2nd century Rome , Baths of Diocletian
      Persephone opening a cista containing the infant Adonis , on a pinax from Locri
      <P> The Romans first heard of her from the Aeolian and Dorian cities of Magna
      Graecia , who used the dialectal variant Proserpinē ( Προσερπίνη ) . Hence ,
      in Roman mythology she was called Proserpina , a name erroneously derived by
      the Romans from proserpere , `` to shoot forth '''' and as such became an emblematic
      figure of the Renaissance . </P> <P> At Locri , perhaps uniquely , Persephone
      was the protector of marriage , a role usually assumed by Hera ; in the iconography
      of votive plaques at Locri , her abduction and marriage to Hades served as an
      emblem of the marital state , children at Locri were dedicated to Proserpina
      , and maidens about to be wed brought their peplos to be blessed . </P> <H3>
      Nestis ( edit ) </H3> <P> In a Classical period text ascribed to Empedocles
      , c. 490 -- 430 BC , describing a correspondence among four deities and the
      classical elements , the name Nestis for water apparently refers to Persephone
      : `` Now hear the fourfold roots of everything : enlivening Hera , Hades , shining
      Zeus . And Nestis , moistening mortal springs with tears . '''' </P> <P> Of
      the four deities of Empedocles '' elements , it is the name of Persephone alone
      that is taboo -- Nestis is a euphemistic cult title -- for she was also the
      terrible Queen of the Dead , whose name was not safe to speak aloud , who was
      euphemistically named simply as Kore or `` the Maiden '''' , a vestige of her
      archaic role as the deity ruling the underworld . </P> <H2> Titles and functions
      ( edit ) </H2> <P> The epithets of Persephone reveal her double function as
      chthonic and vegetation goddess . The surnames given to her by the poets refer
      to her character as Queen of the lower world and the dead , or her symbolic
      meaning of the power that shoots forth and withdraws into the earth . Her common
      name as a vegetation goddess is Kore , and in Arcadia she was worshipped under
      the title Despoina , `` the mistress '''' , a very old chthonic divinity . Plutarch
      identifies her with spring and Cicero calls her the seed of the fruits of the
      fields . In the Eleusinian mysteries , her return is the symbol of immortality
      and hence she was frequently represented on sarcophagi . </P> <P> In the mystical
      theories of the Orphics and the Platonists , Kore is described as the all -
      pervading goddess of nature who both produces and destroys everything , and
      she is therefore mentioned along or identified with other mystic divinities
      such as Isis , Rhea , Ge , Hestia , Pandora , Artemis , and Hecate . The Orphic
      Persephone is further said to have become by Zeus the mother of Dionysus , Iacchus
      , Zagreus , and the little - attested Melinoe . </P> <H3> Epithets ( edit )
      </H3> <P> As a goddess of the underworld , Persephone was given euphemistically
      friendly names . However it is possible that some of them were the names of
      original goddesses : </P> <Ul> <Li> Despoina ( dems - potnia ) `` the mistress
      '''' ( literally `` the mistress of the house '''' ) in Arcadia . </Li> <Li>

      : `` Praxidike , subterranean queen . The Eumenides '' source ( mother ) , fair
      - haired , whose frame proceeds from Zeus '' ineffable and secret seeds . ''''

      Gold ring from Isopata tomb , near Knossos , Crete , 1400 -- 1500 BC . Depicted
      are female figures dancing among blossoming vegetation ; Heraklion Archaeological
      Museum <P> The myth of a goddess being abducted and taken to the Underworld
      is probably Pre-Greek in origin . Samuel Noah Kramer , the renowned scholar
      of ancient Sumer , has posited that the Greek story of the abduction of Persephone
      may be derived from an ancient Sumerian story in which Ereshkigal , the ancient
      Sumerian goddess of the Underworld , is abducted by Kur , the primeval dragon
      of Sumerian mythology , and forced to become ruler of the Underworld against
      her own will . </P> <P> The location of Persephone ''s abduction is different
      in each local cult . The Homeric Hymn to Demeter mentions the `` plain of Nysa
      '''' . The locations of this probably mythical place may simply be conventions
      to show that a magically distant chthonic land of myth was intended in the remote
      past . Demeter found and met her daughter in Eleusis , and this is the mythical
      disguise of what happened in the mysteries . </P> <P> Persephone is an old chthonic
      deity of the agricultural communities , who received the souls of the dead into
      the earth , and acquired powers over the fertility of the soil , over which
      she reigned . The earliest depiction of a goddess who may be identified with
      Persephone growing out of the ground , is on a plate from the Old - Palace period
      in Phaistos . The goddess has a vegetable - like appearance , and she is surrounded
      by dancing girls between blossoming flowers . A similar representation , where
      the goddess appears to come down from the sky , is depicted on the Minoan ring
      of Isopata . </P> Rape of Persephone . Hades with his horses and Persephone
      ( down ) . An Apulian red - figure volute krater , c. 340 BC . Antikensammlung
      Berlin <P> In some forms Hades appears with his chthonic horses . The myth of
      the rape of Kore was derived from the idea that Hades catches the souls of the
      dead and then carries them with his horses into his kingdom . This idea is vague
      in Homer , but appears in later Greek depictions , and in Greek folklore . ``
      Charos '''' appears with his horse and carries the dead into the underworld
      . </P> <P> The cults of Persephone and Demeter in the Eleusinian mysteries and
      in the Thesmophoria were based on old agrarian cults . A lot of ancient beliefs
      were based on initiation into jealously - guarded mysteries ( secret rites )
      because they offered prospects after death more enjoyable than the final end
      at the gloomy space of the Greek Hades . There is evidence that some practices
      were derived from the religious practices of the Mycenaean age . Kerenyi asserts
      that these religious practices were introduced from Minoan Crete. , The idea
      of immortality which appears in the syncretistic religions of the Near East
      did not exist in the Eleusinian mysteries at the very beginning . </P> <H3>
      Near east and Minoan Crete ( edit ) </H3> Lady of Auxerre Louvre - An Archaic
      ( 640 BC ) image from Crete . A version of a Minoan goddess who may be identified
      with Kore <P> In the Near eastern myth of the early agricultural societies ,
      every year the fertility goddess bore the `` god of the new year '''' , who
      then became her lover , and died immediately in order to be reborn and face
      the same destiny . Some findings from Catal Huyuk since the Neolithic age ,
      indicate the worship of the Great Goddess accompanied by a boyish consort ,
      who symbolizes the annual decay and return of vegetation . Similar cults of
      resurrected gods appear in the Near East and Egypt in the cults of Attis , Adonis
      and Osiris . </P> <P> In Minoan Crete , the `` divine child '''' was related
      to the female vegetation divinity Ariadne who died every year . The Minoan religion
      had its own characteristics . The most peculiar feature of the Minoan belief
      in the divine , is the appearance of the goddess from above in the dance . Dance
      floors have been discovered in addition to `` vaulted tombs '''' , and it seems
      that the dance was ecstatic . Homer memorializes the dance floor which Daedalus
      built for Ariadne in the remote past . On the gold ring from Isopata , four
      women in festal attire are performing a dance between blossoming flowers . Above
      a figure apparently floating in the air seems to be the goddess herself , appearing
      amid the whirling dance . An image plate from the first palace of Phaistos ,
      seems to be very close to the mythical image of the Anodos ( ascent ) of Persephone
      . Two girls dance between blossoming flowers , on each side of a similar but
      armless and legless figure which seems to grow out of the ground . The goddess
      is bordered by snake lines which give her a vegetable like appearance She has
      a large stylized flower turned over her head . The resemblance with the flower
      - picking Persephone and her companions is compelling . The depiction of the
      goddess is similar to later images of `` Anodos of Pherephata '''' . On the
      Dresden vase , Persephone is growing out of the ground , and she is surrounded
      by the animal - tailed agricultural gods Silenoi . </P> <P> Kerenyi suggests
      that the name Ariadne ( derived from ἁγνή , hagne , `` pure '''' ) , was an
      euphemistical name given by the Greeks to the nameless `` Mistress of the labyrinth
      '''' who appears in a Mycenean Greek inscription from Knossos in Crete . The
      Greeks used to give friendly names to the deities of the underworld . Cthonic
      Zeus was called Eubuleus , `` the good counselor '''' , and the ferryman of
      the river of the underworld Charon , `` glad '''' . Despoina and `` Hagne ''''
      were probably euphemistic surnames of Persephone , therefore he theorizes that
      the cult of Persephone was the continuation of the worship of a Minoan Great
      goddess . The labyrinth was both a winding dance - ground and , in the Greek
      view , a prison with the dreaded Minotaur at its centre . It is possible that
      some religious practices , especially the mysteries , were transferred from
      a Cretan priesthood to Eleusis , where Demeter brought the poppy from Crete
      . Besides these similarities , Burkert explains that up to now it is not known
      to what extent one can and must differentiate between Minoan and Mycenean religion
      . In the Anthesteria Dionysos is the `` divine child '''' . </P> <H3> Mycenean
      Greece ( edit ) </H3> Two women or goddesses on a chariot . Fresco from Tiryns
      , 1200 BC . National Archaeological Museum of Athens . <P> There is evidence
      of a cult in Eleusis from the Mycenean period ; however , there are not sacral
      finds from this period . The cult was private and there is no information about
      it . As well as the names of some Greek gods in the Mycenean Greek inscriptions
      , also appear names of goddesses , like `` the divine Mother '''' ( the mother
      of the gods ) or `` the Goddess ( or priestess ) of the winds '''' , who do
      n''t have Mycenean origin . In historical times , Demeter and Kore were usually
      referred to as `` the goddesses '''' or `` the mistresses '''' ( Arcadia ) in
      the mysteries . In the Mycenean Greek tablets dated 1400 -- 1200 BC , the ``
      two queens and the king '''' are mentioned . John Chadwick believes that these
      were the precursor divinities of Demeter , Persephone and Poseidon . </P> <P>
      Some information can be obtained from the study of the cult of Eileithyia at
      Crete , and the cult of Despoina . In the cave of Amnisos at Crete , Eileithyia
      is related with the annual birth of the divine child and she is connected with
      Enesidaon ( The earth shaker ) , who is the chthonic aspect of the god Poseidon
      . Persephone was conflated with Despoina , `` the mistress '''' , a chthonic
      divinity in West - Arcadia . The megaron of Eleusis is quite similar with the
      `` megaron '''' of Despoina at Lycosura . Demeter is united with the god Poseidon
      , and she bears a daughter , the unnameable Despoina . Poseidon appears as a
      horse , as it usually happens in Northern European folklore . The goddess of
      nature and her companion survived in the Eleusinian cult , where the following
      words were uttered `` Mighty Potnia bore a great sun '''' . In Eleusis , in
      a ritual , one child ( `` pais '''' ) was initiated from the hearth . The name
      pais ( the divine child ) appears in the Mycenean inscriptions , and the ritual
      indicates the transition from the old funerary practices to the Greek cremation
      . </P> <P> In Greek mythology Nysa is a mythical mountain with an unknown location
      . Nysion ( or Mysion ) , the place of the abduction of Persephone was also probably
      a mythical place which did not exist on the map , a magically distant chthonic
      land of myth which was intended in the remote past . </P> <H2> Mythology ( edit
      ) </H2> <H3> Abduction myth ( edit ) </H3> Sarcophagus with the abduction of
      Persephone . Walters Art Museum . Baltimore , Maryland <P> The story of her
      abduction by Hades against her will is traditionally referred to as the Rape
      of Persephone . It is mentioned briefly in Hesiod ''s Theogony , and told in
      considerable detail in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter . Persephone used to live
      far away from the other gods , a goddess within Nature herself before the days
      of planting seeds and nurturing plants . In the Olympian telling , the gods
      Hermes and Apollo had wooed Persephone ; but Demeter rejected all their gifts
      and hid her daughter away from the company of the Olympian gods . Zeus , it
      is said , permitted Hades , who was in love with the beautiful Persephone ,
      to abduct her as her mother Demeter was not likely to allow her daughter to
      go down to Hades . Persephone was gathering flowers with the Oceanids along
      with Artemis and Athena -- the Homeric Hymn says -- in a field when Hades came
      to abduct her , bursting through a cleft in the earth . Demeter , when she found
      her daughter had disappeared , searched for her all over the earth with Hecate
      ''s torches . In most versions she forbids the earth to produce , or she neglects
      the earth and in the depth of her despair she causes nothing to grow . Helios
      , the sun , who sees everything , eventually told Demeter what had happened
      and at length she discovered the place of her abode . Finally , Zeus , pressed
      by the cries of the hungry people and by the other deities who also heard their
      anguish , forced Hades to return Persephone . </P> The Rape of Proserpina by
      Gian Lorenzo Bernini at the Galleria Borghese in Rome . <P> Hades indeed complied
      with the request , but first he tricked her , giving her some pomegranate seeds
      to eat . Persephone was released by Hermes , who had been sent to retrieve her
      , but because she had tasted food in the underworld , she was obliged to spend
      a third of each year ( the winter months ) there , and the remaining part of
      the year with the gods above . With the later writers Ovid and Hyginus , Persephone
      ''s time in the underworld becomes half the year . </P> <P> Various local traditions
      place Persephone ''s abduction in a different location . The Sicilians , among
      whom her worship was probably introduced by the Corinthian and Megarian colonists
      , believed that Hades found her in the meadows near Enna , and that a well arose
      on the spot where he descended with her into the lower world . The Cretans thought
      that their own island had been the scene of the rape , and the Eleusinians mentioned
      the Nysian plain in Boeotia , and said that Persephone had descended with Hades
      into the lower world at the entrance of the western Oceanus . Later accounts
      place the rape in Attica , near Athens , or near Eleusis . </P> The return of
      Persephone , by Frederic Leighton ( 1891 ) <P> The Homeric hymn mentions the
      Nysion ( or Mysion ) which was probably a mythical place . The location of this
      mythical place may simply be a convention to show that a magically distant chthonic
      land of myth was intended in the remote past . Before Persephone was abducted
      by Hades , the shepherd Eumolpus and the swineherd Eubuleus saw a girl in a
      black chariot driven by an invisible driver being carried off into the earth
      which had violently opened up . Eubuleus was feeding his pigs at the opening
      to the underworld when Persephone was abducted by Plouton . His swine were swallowed
      by the earth along with her , and the myth is an etiology for the relation of
      pigs with the ancient rites in Thesmophoria , and in Eleusis . </P> <P> In the
      hymn , Persephone returns and she is reunited with her mother near Eleusis .
      Demeter as she has been promised established her mysteries ( orgies ) when the
      Eleusinians built for her a temple near the spring of Callichorus . These were
      awful mysteries which were not allowed to be uttered . The uninitiated would
      spend a miserable existence in the gloomy space of Hades after death . </P>
      <P> In some versions , Ascalaphus informed the other deities that Persephone
      had eaten the pomegranate seeds . When Demeter and her daughter were reunited
      , the Earth flourished with vegetation and color , but for some months each
      year , when Persephone returned to the underworld , the earth once again became
      a barren realm . This is an origin story to explain the seasons . </P> <P> In
      an earlier version , Hecate rescued Persephone . On an Attic red - figured bell
      krater of c. 440 BC in the Metropolitan Museum of Art , Persephone is rising
      as if up stairs from a cleft in the earth , while Hermes stands aside ; Hecate
      , holding two torches , looks back as she leads her to the enthroned Demeter
      . </P> <P> The 10th - century Byzantine encyclopedia Suda introduces a goddess
      of a blessed afterlife assured to Orphic mystery initiates . This Macaria is
      asserted to be the daughter of Hades , but no mother is mentioned . </P> <H3>
      Interpretation of the myth ( edit ) </H3> Pinax of Persephone and Hades from
      Locri . Reggio Calabria , National Museum of Magna Graecia . <P> In the myth
      Pluto abducts Persephone to be his wife and the queen of his realm . Pluto (
      Πλούτων , Ploutōn ) was a name for the ruler of the underworld ; the god was
      also known as Hades , a name for the underworld itself . The name Pluton was
      conflated with that of Ploutos ( Πλούτος Ploutos , `` wealth '''' ) , a god
      of wealth , because mineral wealth was found underground , and because Pluto
      as a chthonic god ruled the deep earth that contained the seeds necessary for
      a bountiful harvest . Plouton is lord of the dead , but as Persephone ''s husband
      he has serious claims to the powers of fertility . </P> <P> In the Theogony
      of Hesiod , Demeter was united with the hero Iasion in Crete and she bore Ploutos
      . This union seems to be a reference to a hieros gamos ( ritual copulation )
      to ensure the earth ''s fertility . This ritual copulation appears in Minoan
      Crete , in many Near Eastern agricultural societies , and also in the Anthesteria
      . </P> <P> Nilsson believes that the original cult of Ploutos ( or Pluto ) in
      Eleusis was similar with the Minoan cult of the `` divine child '''' , who died
      in order to be reborn . The child was abandoned by his mother and then it was
      brought up by the powers of nature . Similar myths appear in the cults of Hyakinthos
      ( Amyklai ) , Erichthonios ( Athens ) , and later in the cult of Dionysos .
      </P> <P> The Greek version of the abduction myth is related to grain -- important
      and rare in the Greek environment -- and the return ( ascent ) of Persephone
      was celebrated at the autumn sowing . Pluto ( Ploutos ) represents the wealth
      of the grain that was stored in underground silos or ceramic jars ( pithoi )
      , during summer months . Similar subterranean pithoi were used in ancient times
      for burials and Pluto is fused with Hades , the King of the realm of the dead
      . During summer months , the Greek grain - Maiden ( Kore ) is lying in the grain
      of the underground silos in the realm of Hades , and she is fused with Persephone
      , the Queen of the Underworld . At the beginning of the autumn , when the seeds
      of the old crop are laid on the fields , she ascends and is reunited with her
      mother Demeter , for at that time the old crop and the new meet each other .
      For the initiated , this union was the symbol of the eternity of human life
      that flows from the generations which spring from each other . </P> <H3> Arcadian
      myths ( edit ) </H3> From L-R , Artemis , Demeter , Veil of Despoina , Anytus
      , Tritoness from the throne of Despoina at Lycosura . National Archaeological
      Museum of Athens <P> The primitive myths of isolated Arcadia seem to be related
      to the first Greek - speaking people who came from the north - east during the
      bronze age . Despoina ( the mistress ) , the goddess of the Arcadian mysteries
      , is the daughter of Demeter and Poseidon Hippios ( horse ) , who represents
      the river spirit of the underworld that appears as a horse as often happens
      in northern - European folklore . He pursues the mare - Demeter and from the
      union she bears the horse Arion and a daughter who originally had the form or
      the shape of a mare . The two goddesses were not clearly separated and they
      were closely connected with the springs and the animals . They were related
      with the god of rivers and springs ; Poseidon and especially with Artemis ,
      the Mistress of the Animals who was the first nymph . According to the Greek
      tradition a hunt - goddess preceded the harvest goddess . In Arcadia , Demeter
      and Persephone were often called Despoinai ( Δέσποιναι , `` the mistresses ''''
      ) in historical times . They are the two Great Goddesses of the Arcadian cults
      , and evidently they come from a more primitive religion . The Greek god Poseidon
      probably substituted the companion ( Paredros , Πάρεδρος ) of the Minoan Great
      goddess in the Arcadian mysteries . </P> Seated goddess , probably Persephone
      on her throne in the underworld , Severe style ca 480 -- 60 , found at Tarentum
      , Magna Graecia ( Pergamon Museum , Berlin ) <H3> Queen of the underworld (
      edit ) </H3> <P> Persephone held an ancient role as the dread queen of the Underworld
      , within which tradition it was forbidden to speak her name . This tradition
      comes from her conflation with the very old chthonic divinity Despoina ( the
      mistress ) , whose real name could not be revealed to anyone except those initiated
      to her mysteries . As goddess of death she was also called a daughter of Zeus
      and Styx , the river that formed the boundary between Earth and the underworld
      . Homer describes her as the formidable , venerable majestic queen of the shades
      , who carries into effect the curses of men upon the souls of the dead , along
      with her husband Hades . In the reformulation of Greek mythology expressed in
      the Orphic Hymns , Dionysus and Melinoe are separately called children of Zeus
      and Persephone . Groves sacred to her stood at the western extremity of the
      earth on the frontiers of the lower world , which itself was called `` house
      of Persephone '''' . </P> <P> Her central myth served as the context for the
      secret rites of regeneration at Eleusis , which promised immortality to initiates
      . </P> <H2> Cult of Persephone ( edit ) </H2> <P> Persephone was worshipped
      along with her mother Demeter and in the same mysteries . Her cults included
      agrarian magic , dancing , and rituals . The priests used special vessels and
      holy symbols , and the people participated with rhymes . In Eleusis there is
      evidence of sacred laws and other inscriptions . </P> <P> The Cult of Demeter
      and the Maiden is found at Attica , in the main festivals Thesmophoria and Eleusinian
      mysteries and in a lot of local cults . These festivals were almost always celebrated
      at the autumn sowing , and at full - moon according to the Greek tradition .
      In some local cults the feasts were dedicated to Demeter . </P> <H3> Thesmophoria
      ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Thesmophoria Kore , daughter of Demeter , celebrated
      with her mother by the Thesmophoriazusae ( women of the festival ) . Acropolis
      Museum , Athens <P> Thesmophoria , were celebrated in Athens , and the festival
      was widely spread in Greece . This was a festival of secret women - only rituals
      connected with marriage customs and commemorated the third of the year , in
      the month Pyanepsion , when Kore was abducted and Demeter abstained from her
      role as goddess of harvest and growth . The ceremony involved sinking sacrifices
      into the earth by night and retrieving the decaying remains of pigs that had
      been placed in the megara of Demeter ( trenches and pits or natural clefts in
      rock ) , the previous year . These were placed on altars , mixed with seeds
      , then planted . Pits rich in organic matter at Eleusis have been taken as evidence
      that the Thesmophoria was held there as well as in other demes of Attica . This
      agrarian magic was also used in the cult of the earth - goddesses potniai (
      mistresses ) in the Cabeirian , and in Knidos . </P> <P> The festival was celebrated
      over three days . The first was the `` way up '''' to the sacred space , the
      second , the day of feasting when they ate pomegranate seeds and the third was
      a meat feast in celebration of Kalligeneia a goddess of beautiful birth . Zeus
      penetrated the mysteries as Zeus - Eubuleus which is an euphemistical name of
      Hades ( Chthonios Zeus ) . In the original myth which is an etiology for the
      ancient rites , Eubuleus was a swineherd who was feeding his pigs at the opening
      to the underworld when Persephone was abducted by Plouton . His swine were swallowed
      by the earth along with her . </P> <H3> Eleusinian mysteries ( edit ) </H3>
      Main article : Eleusinian mysteries The Eleusinian trio : Persephone , Triptolemus
      and Demeter on a marble bas - relief from Eleusis , 440 -- 430 BC . National
      Archaeological Museum of Athens <P> The Eleusinian mysteries was a festival
      celebrated at the autumn sowing in the city of Eleusis . Inscriptions refer
      to `` the Goddesses '''' accompanied by the agricultural god Triptolemos ( probably
      son of Ge and Oceanus ) , and `` the God and the Goddess '''' ( Persephone and
      Plouton ) accompanied by Eubuleus who probably led the way back from the underworld
      . The myth was represented in a cycle with three phases : the `` descent ''''
      , the `` search '''' , and the `` ascent '''' , with contrasted emotions from
      sorrow to joy which roused the mystae to exultation . The main theme was the
      ascent of Persephone and the reunion with her mother Demeter . The festival
      activities included dancing , probably across the Rharian field , where according
      to the myth the first grain grew . </P> <P> At the beginning of the feast ,
      the priests filled two special vessels and poured them out , the one towards
      the west , and the other towards the east . The people looking both to the sky
      and the earth shouted in a magical rhyme `` rain and conceive '''' . In a ritual
      , a child was initiated from the hearth ( the divine fire ) . It was the ritual
      of the `` divine child '''' who originally was Ploutos . In the Homeric hymn
      the ritual is connected with the myth of the agricultural god Triptolemos The
      high point of the celebration was `` an ear of grain cut in silence '''' , which
      represented the force of the new life . The idea of immortality did n''t exist
      in the mysteries at the beginning , but the initiated believed that they would
      have a better fate in the underworld . Death remained a reality , but at the
      same time a new beginning like the plant which grows from the buried seed .

      was performed , so - called on the grounds that Demeter gave it to the Cabeiri
      , who established it at Thebes . The Thebans told Pausanias that some inhabitants
      of Naupactus had performed the same rituals there , and had met with divine
      vengeance . The Cabeirian mysteries were introduced from Asia Minor at the end
      of the archaic period . Nothing is known of the older cult , and it seems that
      the Cabeiri were originally wine - daemons . Inscriptions from the temple in
      Thebes mention the old one as Cabir , and the new one as son ( pais ) , who
      are different . According to Pausanias , Pelarge , the daughter of Potnieus

      : Persephone in popular culture <P> In 1934 , Igor Stravinsky based his melodrama
      Perséphone on Persephone ''s story . In 1961 , Frederick Ashton of the Royal
      Ballet appropriated Stravinsky ''s score , to choreograph a ballet starring
      Svetlana Beriosova as Persephone . </P> <P> Persephone also appears many times
      in popular culture . Featured in a variety of young adult novels such as ``
      Persephone '''' by Kaitlin Bevis , `` Persephone ''s Orchard '''' by Molly Ringle
      , `` The Goddess Test '''' by Aimee Carter , `` The Goddess Letters '''' by
      Carol Orlock , and `` Abandon '''' by Meg Cabot , her story has also been treated
      by Suzanne Banay Santo in `` Persephone Under the Earth '''' in the light of
      women ''s spirituality . Here Santo treats the mythic elements in terms of maternal
      sacrifice to the burgeoning sexuality of an adolescent daughter . Accompanied
      by the classic , sensual paintings of Frederic Lord Leighton and William - Adolphe
      Bouguereau , Santo portrays Persephone not as a victim but as a woman in quest
      of sexual depth and power , transcending the role of daughter , though ultimately
      returning to it as an awakened Queen . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul>

      organisms . Unitary organisms have determinate development ( set life stages
      ) from zygote to adult form and individuals or groups of individuals ( colonies
      ) are visually distinct . Modular organisms have indeterminate growth forms
      ( life stages not set ) through repeated iteration of genetically identical
      modules ( or individuals ) , and it can be difficult to distinguish between
      the colony as a whole and the modules within . In the latter case , modules
      may have specific functions within the colony . </P> <P> Some organisms are
      primarily independent and form facultative colonies in reply to environmental
      conditions while others must live in a colony to survive ( obligate ) . For
      example , some carpenter bees will form colonies when a dominant hierarchy is
      formed between two or more nest foundresses ( facultative colony ) , while corals
      are animals that are physically connected by living tissue ( the coenosarc )
      that contains a shared gastrovascular cavity . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2>

      colony of Northern gannets on the Heligoland archipelago in the North Sea .
      <P> Unicellular and multicellular unitary organisms may aggregate to form colonies
      . For example , </P> <Ul> <Li> Protists such as slime molds are many unicellular
      organisms that aggregate to form colonies when food resources are hard to come
      by , as together they are more reactive to chemical cues released by preferred
      prey . </Li> <Li> Eusocial insects like ants and honey bees are multicellular
      animals that live in colonies with a highly organized social structure . Colonies
      of some social insects may be deemed superorganisms . </Li> <Li> Animals such
      as humans and rodents form breeding or nesting colonies , potentially for more
      successful mating and to better protect offspring . <Ul> <Li> The Bracken Cave
      is the summer home to a colony of around 20 million Mexican free - tailed bats
      making it the largest known concentration of mammals . </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul>
      <H3> Modular organisms ( edit ) </H3> <P> Modular organisms are those in which
      a genet ( or genetic individual formed from a sexually - produced zygote ) asexually
      reproduces to form genetically identical clones called ramets . </P> <P> A clonal
      colony is when the ramets of a genet live in close proximity or are physically
      connected . Ramets may have all of the functions needed to survive on their
      own or be interdependent on other ramets . For example , some sea anemones go
      through the process of pedal laceration in which a genetically identical individual
      is asexually produced from tissue broken off from the anemone ''s pedal disc
      . In plants , clonal colonies are created through the propagation of genetically
      identical trees by stolons or rhizomes . </P> <P> Colonial organisms are clonal
      colonies composed of many physically connected , interdependent individuals
      . Colonial organisms can be unicellular , as in the alga Volvox ( a coenobium
      ) , or multicellular , as in the phylum Bryozoa . The former type may have been
      the first step toward multicellular organisms . Individuals within a multicellular
      colonial organism may be called ramets , modules , or zooids . Structural and
      functional variation ( polymorphism ) , when present , designates ramet responsibilities
      such as feeding , reproduction , and defense . To that end , being physically
      connected allows the colonial organism to distribute nutrients and energy obtained
      by feeding zooids throughout the colony . An example of colonial organisms that
      is well known are hydrozoans , like Portuguese man o '' wars . </P> <H3> Microbial
      colonies ( edit ) </H3> <P> A microbial colony is defined as a visible cluster
      of microorganisms growing on the surface of or within a solid medium , presumably
      cultured from a single cell . Because the colony is clonal , with all organisms
      in it descending from a single ancestor ( assuming no contamination ) , they
      are genetically identical , except for any mutations ( which occur at low frequencies
      ) . Obtaining such genetically identical organisms ( or pure strains ) can be
      useful ; this is done by spreading organisms on a culture plate and starting
      a new stock from a single resulting colony . </P> <P> A biofilm is a colony
      of microorganisms often comprising several species , with properties and capabilities
      greater than the aggregate of capabilities of the individual organisms . </P>
      <H2> Life history ( edit ) </H2> <P> Individuals in social colonies and modular
      organisms receive benefit to such a lifestyle . For example , it may be easier
      to seek out food , defend a nesting site , or increase competitive ability against
      other species . Modular organisms '' ability to reproduce asexually in addition
      to sexually allows them unique benefits that social colonies do not have . </P>
      <P> The energy required for sexual reproduction varies based on the frequency
      and length of reproductive activity , number and size of offspring , and parental
      care . While solitary individuals bear all of those energy costs , individuals
      in some social colonies share a portion of those costs . </P> <P> Modular organisms
      save energy by using asexual reproduction during their life . Energy reserved
      in this way allows them to put more energy towards colony growth , regenerating
      lost modules ( due to predation or other cause of death ) , or response to environmental
      conditions . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td>

      </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The Man in the High Castle is an American dystopian
      alternative history television series produced by Amazon Studios , Scott Free
      Productions , Headline Pictures , Electric Shepherd Productions and Big Light
      Productions . The series is loosely based on the 1962 novel of the same name
      by science fiction author Philip K. Dick . In the series '' alternate version
      of 1962 America , the Axis powers have won World War II and divided the United
      States into two puppet states : the Greater Nazi Reich and the Japanese Pacific
      States . The series follows characters whose destinies intertwine after coming
      into contact with a series of propaganda films that show a vastly different
      history from that of their own . </P> <P> Premiering in January 2015 , the pilot
      was Amazon ''s `` most - watched since the original series development program
      began . '''' The next month Amazon ordered episodes to fill out a ten - episode
      season , which was released in November , to positive reviews . A second season
      of ten episodes premiered in December 2016 , with a third season announced a
      few weeks later to be released in 2018 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> (

      ) </H3> <P> The central characters are Juliana Crain , Frank Frink , Joe Blake
      , John Smith , Nobusuke Tagomi , and Takeshi Kido . The series takes place in
      an alternate 1962 . </P> Flag of the Greater Nazi Reich in America Flag of the
      Japanese Pacific States <P> Juliana Crain is a San Francisco woman who becomes
      entangled with the resistance when her half - sister Trudy is killed by the
      Kempeitai , just after giving Juliana a film reel that contains newsreel - style
      footage depicting an alternate history in which the Allies won World War II
      and Germany and Japan were defeated . The film is entitled The Grasshopper Lies
      Heavy , and is part of a series of similar newsreels being collected by someone
      referred to as `` The Man in the High Castle '''' . Juliana believes the newsreel
      reflects some sort of alternate reality and that it is part of some kind of
      larger truth about how the world should be . Her boyfriend , Frank Frink ( who
      keeps his Jewish roots hidden in order to avoid extradition and death at the
      hands of the Nazis ) , believes that the newsreel has no relation to real -
      life events . Juliana learns Trudy was carrying the film to Canon City , Colorado
      , in the Neutral Zone , where she was going to meet someone . Juliana decides
      to travel there in Trudy ''s place to find out what her half - sister ''s mission
      was . When she arrives in Canon City , she encounters Joe Blake . </P> <P> Blake
      is a 27 - year - old New Yorker who is a double agent working for the Nazis
      under Obergruppenführer John Smith , a former US Army officer who joined the
      Nazis and rose through the ranks to become a senior officer in the SS . Blake
      is pretending to be a member of the resistance while he searches for the resistance
      contact in Canon City , which is Juliana , substituting for Trudy . </P> <P>
      Nobusuke Tagomi is a high - ranking Japanese official ( the Trade Minister )
      in San Francisco . He meets in secret with Nazi official Rudolph Wegener , who
      is traveling incognito as Swedish businessman Victore Baynes . Tagomi and Wegener
      are concerned about the power vacuum that will exist when the Reich ''s Führer
      Adolf Hitler dies , or is forced to step down due to his worsening Parkinson
      ''s disease . Wegener explains that Hitler ''s successor will want to use the
      Reich ''s nuclear bombs against Japan to gain control of the rest of the former
      United States . Currently , however , Japan and the Third Reich are engaged
      in a cold war full of tension but no open warfare , with the Japanese lagging
      behind the Germans technologically . </P> <P> Frank Frink ends up being arrested
      when the Japanese and the Nazis become suspicious of Juliana ''s activities
      . Not having the information they seek , he is unable to give the Japanese what
      they are looking for , and they kill Frink ''s sister and her two children in
      retaliation , using their Jewish heritage as an excuse for their executions
      . This leads Frink to plan to kill the visiting Japanese Crown Prince and Princess
      , but he ultimately decides against going through with his plan . </P> <H3>
      Season two ( edit ) </H3> <P> Season Two of the show broadly encompasses Frank
      Frink deciding to forgo his hesitancy and relative pacifism and choosing to
      become a committed member of the American Resistance to the Japanese Empire
      inside the Pacific States , eventually participating in a successful terrorist
      bombing of a central - command building of the Pacific States government in
      downtown San Francisco . The attack kills many members of the Japanese military
      and other top - level leadership . </P> <P> Juliana Crain claims asylum in the
      Nazi Reich using their San Francisco Embassy so she can escape Japanese soldiers
      who hold her responsible for at least one murder . John Smith , seeing that
      her asylum claim is unlikely to succeed , steps in to the interrogation room
      and assumes command of her claim himself , ensuring it goes through , and he
      takes her to New York without Joe Blake ''s knowledge . Joe Blake himself discovers
      he was a product of the Lebensborn programme , and also that he is the sole
      biological son of a top - ranking Nazi official in Berlin , Martin Heusmann
      . Eventually Blake reconciles with Heusmann on the personal level and , in so
      doing , becomes second - in - command of the Chancellorship after Adolf Hitler
      dies and the Nazi leadership in Berlin grants Heusmann the Reich ''s Acting
      Chancellor title , which they do quickly and almost by default . </P> <P> Hitler
      ''s death is abruptly pinned upon Japanese spies , and Heusmann suddenly announces
      on television that the Japanese agents whom he claims assassinated the Führer
      will be brought to justice by any means necessary , including war . John Smith
      is the only high - ranking Nazi official to be suspicious of the nature of Heusmann
      ''s sudden announcement . To gain insight in to why it has happened , he interrogates
      another high - ranking Nazi , Reinhard Heydrich , who reveals a far - reaching
      conspiracy led by Heusmann designed to result in a Nazi nuclear onslaught against
      the Japanese Empire that will kill tens of millions of Japanese , decimate their
      Empire , level Tokyo , kill their Emperor , and force the surviving Japanese
      to permanently absorb themselves in to a global Nazi Reich . John Smith undertakes
      carefully - calculated stealth actions to disrupt and dismantle the Heusmann
      conspiracy and , as a final act , travels to Berlin and informs Heinrich Himmler
      -- the Nazi Reichsführer and not involved in the conspiracy -- of the existence
      of the conspiracy . Audiotapes , together with physical and written evidence
      reaching too deep within the existing Reich ''s power structure to be dismissed
      as hearsay , are handed personally by John Smith over to the Reichsführer ,
      who then angrily leads Smith and several of his closest Berlin subordinates
      in to the late Führer ''s office occupied by the Acting Chancellor . He arrests
      Heusmann for high treason and the murder of Adolf Hitler , detains Joe Blake
      along with Heusmann , and then addresses the Volkshalle packed with hundreds
      of thousands of Reich civilians and uniformed stormtroopers , nixing the war
      - declaration speech meant to have been delivered by Heusmann and instead informing
      the Reich of Heusmann ''s conspiracy and John Smith ''s exposing of it . Upon
      learning this , the entire Volkshalle erupts in to a celebratory mood marked
      by repeated mass Nazi salutes of Himmler ''s men in general and then John Smith
      in particular . </P> <P> The second season ends with Himmler and John Smith
      implicitly assuming command of the Reich , and an implied new era of peace and
      tranquility between the Japanese Empire and the Greater Nazi Reich . Juliana
      Crain continues to live out her asylum claim inside New York Nazi territory
      , and the final few minutes of the final episode of the second season show Trudy
      ( or an alternate - universe version of her ) alive and well . In a basement
      somewhere , John Smith is given access to a room filled to bursting with reels
      of films watched by the late Führer . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Main

      controversy ( edit ) </H3> <P> As part of an advertising campaign for the release
      of the first season , one entire New York City Subway car was covered with Nazi
      and Imperial Japanese imagery as seen in the show , including multiple American
      flags with the Nazi eagle emblem in place of the 50 stars and multiple flags
      of the fictional Pacific States . In response to criticism from `` state lawmakers
      and city leaders '''' , the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ( MTA ) released
      a statement saying that there were no grounds to reject the ads due to the fact
      that neutral content subway ad standards only prohibit advertising that is a
      political advertisement or disparages an individual or group . MTA spokesperson
      Kevin Ortiz stated that , `` The MTA is a government agency and ca n''t accept
      or reject ads based on how we feel about them ; we have to follow the standards
      approved by our board . Please note they ''re commercial ads . '''' Spokesperson
      Adam Lisberg said , `` This advertising , whether you find it distasteful or
      not , obviously they ''re not advertising Nazism ; they ''re advertising a TV
      show . '''' After complaints from New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo and New
      York City Mayor Bill de Blasio , initial reports indicated that Amazon pulled
      the advertisement from the subway . It was later announced that it was the MTA
      , not Amazon , that pulled the ad , due to pressure from Governor Cuomo . </P>

      other Commonwealth realms . The Queen was represented in Nigeria by a Governor
      - General . Nigeria became a federal republic under the Constitution of 1963

      . In 1979 , under the 1979 Constitution , the President gained executive powers
      , becoming head of both state and government . Since 1994 , under the 1993 Constitution

      - General was the representative of the monarch in Nigeria and exercised most
      of the powers of the monarch . The Governor - General was appointed for an indefinite
      term , serving at the pleasure of the monarch . Since Nigeria was granted independence
      by the Nigeria Independence Act 1960 , rather than being first established as
      a semi-autonomous Dominion and later promoted to independence by the Statute
      of Westminster 1931 , the Governor - General was appointed solely on the advice
      of the Nigerian cabinet without the involvement of the British government ,
      with the sole of exception of James Robertson , the former colonial governor
      , who served as Governor - General temporarily until he was replaced by Nnamdi
      Azikiwe . In the event of a vacancy the Chief Justice would have served as Officer
      Administering the Government . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan="3"> Governor -

      in the spring of 1989 , and his government established two political parties
      : the center - right National Republican Convention ( NRC ) and the center -
      left Social Democratic Party ( SDP ) . Gubernatorial and state legislative elections
      were conducted in December 1991 , while the presidential election was postponed
      till 12 June 1993 -- due to political unrest . M.K.O. Abiola , a wealthy Yoruba
