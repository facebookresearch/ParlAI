      This article is about the weather phenomenon . For other uses , see Tradewind
      . The westerlies ( blue arrows ) and trade winds ( yellow and brown arrows )
      <P> The trade winds are the prevailing pattern of easterly surface winds found
      in the tropics , within the lower portion of the Earth ''s atmosphere , in the
      lower section of the troposphere near the Earth ''s equator . The trade winds
      blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the
      southeast in the Southern Hemisphere , strengthening during the winter and when
      the Arctic oscillation is in its warm phase . Trade winds have been used by
      captains of sailing ships to cross the world ''s oceans for centuries , and
      enabled European empire expansion into the Americas and trade routes to become
      established across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans . </P> <P> In meteorology
      , the trade winds act as the steering flow for tropical storms that form over
      the Atlantic , Pacific , and southern Indian Oceans and make landfall in North
      America , Southeast Asia , and Madagascar and eastern Africa , respectively
      . Trade winds also transport African dust westward across the Atlantic Ocean
      into the Caribbean Sea , as well as portions of southeastern North America .
      Shallow cumulus clouds are seen within trade wind regimes , and are capped from
      becoming taller by a trade wind inversion , which is caused by descending air
      aloft from within the subtropical ridge . The weaker the trade winds become
      , the more rainfall can be expected in the neighboring landmasses . </P> <P>

      <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> A Spanish galleon See also : Age of Discovery
      , Volta do Mar , and Age of sail <P> The term trade winds originally derives
      from the early fourteenth century late Middle English word '' trade , '' meaning
      `` path '''' or `` track . '''' The Portuguese recognized the importance of
      the trade winds ( then the Volta do mar , meaning in Portuguese `` turn of the
      sea '''' but also `` return from the sea '''' ) in navigation in both the north
      and south Atlantic ocean as early as the 15th century . From West Africa , the
      Portuguese had to sail away from continental Portugal , that is , to west and
      northwest . They could then turn northeast , to the area around the Azores islands
      , and finally east to mainland Europe . They also learned that to reach South
      Africa , they needed to go far out in the ocean , head for Brazil , and around
      30 ° S go east again . Following the African coast southbound means upwind in
      the Southern hemisphere . In the Pacific ocean , the full wind circulation ,
      which included both the trade wind easterlies and higher - latitude Westerlies
      , was unknown to Europeans until Andres de Urdaneta ''s voyage in 1565 . </P>
      <P> The captain of a sailing ship seeks a course along which the winds can be
      expected to blow in the direction of travel . During the Age of Sail , the pattern
      of prevailing winds made various points of the globe easy or difficult to access
      , and therefore had a direct effect on European empire - building and thus on
      modern political geography . For example , Manila galleons could not sail into
      the wind at all . </P> <P> By the 18th century the importance of the trade winds
      to England ''s merchant fleet for crossing the Atlantic Ocean had led both the
      general public and etymologists to identify the name with a later meaning of
      '' trade '' , `` ( foreign ) commerce '''' . Between 1847 and 1849 , Matthew
      Fontaine Maury collected enough information to create wind and current charts
      for the world ''s oceans . </P> <H2> Cause ( edit ) </H2> 3D map showing Hadley
      cells in relationship to trade winds on the surface . See also : Air mass ,
      Hadley cell , Humidity , Intertropical Convergence Zone , Monsoon , Monsoon
      trough , Near - equatorial trough , and Prevailing winds <P> As part of the
      Hadley cell circulation , surface air flows toward the equator while the flow
      aloft is towards the poles . A low - pressure area of calm , light variable
      winds near the equator is known as the doldrums , near - equatorial trough ,
      intertropical front , or the Intertropical Convergence Zone . When located within
      a monsoon region , this zone of low pressure and wind convergence is also known
      as the monsoon trough . Around 30 ° in both hemispheres , air begins to descend
      toward the surface in subtropical high - pressure belts known as subtropical
      ridges . The subsident ( sinking ) air is relatively dry because as it descends
      , the temperature increases , but the absolute humidity remains constant , which
      lowers the relative humidity of the air mass . This warm , dry air is known
      as a superior air mass and normally resides above a maritime tropical ( warm
      and moist ) air mass . An increase of temperature with height is known as a
      temperature inversion . When it occurs within a trade wind regime , it is known
      as a trade wind inversion . </P> <P> The surface air that flows from these subtropical
      high - pressure belts toward the Equator is deflected toward the west in both
      hemispheres by the Coriolis effect . These winds blow predominantly from the
      northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern
      Hemisphere . Because winds are named for the direction from which the wind is
      blowing , these winds are called the northeasterly trade winds in the Northern
      Hemisphere and the southeasterly trade winds in the Southern Hemisphere . The
      trade winds of both hemispheres meet at the doldrums . </P> <P> As they blow
      across tropical regions , air masses heat up over lower latitudes due to more
      direct sunlight . Those that develop over land ( continental ) are drier and
      hotter than those that develop over oceans ( maritime ) , and travel northward
      on the western periphery of the subtropical ridge . Maritime tropical air masses
      are sometimes referred to as trade air masses . The one region of the Earth
      which has an absence of trade winds is the north Indian ocean . </P> <H2> Weather
      effects ( edit ) </H2> <P> Clouds which form above regions within trade wind
      regimes are typically composed of cumulus which extend no more than 4 kilometres
      ( 13,000 ft ) in height , and are capped from being taller by the trade wind
      inversion . Trade winds originate more from the direction of the poles ( northeast
      in the Northern Hemisphere , southeast in the Southern Hemisphere ) during the
      cold season , and are stronger in the winter than the summer . As an example
      , the windy season in the Guianas , which lie at low latitudes in South America
      , occurs between January and April . When the phase of the Arctic oscillation
      ( AO ) is warm , trade winds are stronger within the tropics . The cold phase
      of the AO leads to weaker trade winds . When the trade winds are weaker , more
      extensive areas of rain fall upon landmasses within the tropics , such as Central
      America . </P> <P> During mid-summer in the Northern Hemisphere ( July ) , the
      westward - moving trade winds south of the northward - moving subtropical ridge
      expand northwestward from the Caribbean sea into southeastern North America
      ( Florida and Gulf Coast ) . When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern
      periphery of the ridge travels over land , rainfall is suppressed and the sky
      changes from a blue to a white appearance which leads to an increase in red
      sunsets . Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count
      of airborne particulates . Although the Southeast USA has some of the cleanest
      air in North America , much of the African dust that reaches the United States
      affects Florida . Since 1970 , dust outbreaks have worsened due to periods of
      drought in Africa . There is a large variability in the dust transport to the
      Caribbean and Florida from year to year . Dust events have been linked to a
      decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida , primarily
      since the 1970s . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Intertropical

      year ends with everyone at East High School looking forward to summer vacation
      ( `` What Time Is It '''' ) . Troy Bolton is still dating Gabriella Montez ,
      who decides to stay in Albuquerque with her mother . Troy eventually decides
      to look for a summer job to gain money for college . </P> <P> Sharpay and Ryan
      Evans plan to spend part of the summer at their family ''s country club , Lava
      Springs ( `` Fabulous '''' ) , but Sharpay ''s summer plans also include pursuing
      Troy , whom she has arranged to be hired at the club . However , Troy convinces
      the club ''s manager , Mr. Fulton , into hiring Gabriella and their close group
      of friends as well ; including Taylor and Chad . Sharpay is enraged upon learning
      that Gabriella is working as one of the lifeguards , but is unable to get her
      fired . So she orders Fulton to give them difficult tasks so they would be best
      to quit . Fulton attempts to intimidate the group , but Troy rebuilds their
      confidence and convinces them that they can persevere ( `` Work This Out ''''
      ) . </P> <P> Troy continues to worry about funding for college . Sharpay senses
      his need and arranges for Troy to be promoted , hoping that this will convince
      him to sing with her at the talent show . Meanwhile , Kelsi writes a ballad
      for Troy and Gabriella . Troy agrees to sing with his friends in the show (
      `` You Are The Music In Me '''' ) , not knowing that Sharpay is vying for his
      attention . ( In the extended version , Sharpay and Ryan trap Troy as he prepares
      for a date with Gabriella , and perform their potential show - stopper ( ``
      Humuhumunukunukuapua''a '''' ) . ) </P> <P> Ryan realizes he does not mean much
      to Sharpay anymore , as she is ready to blow her brother aside for the opportunity
      to perform with Troy . This leads to tension between the twin siblings and Ryan
      angrily informs Sharpay that he will no longer obey her orders . Taylor and
      Gabriella invite Ryan to the baseball game , where he persuades the Wildcats
      to take part in the talent show ( `` I Do n''t Dance '''' ) . </P> <P> Troy
      and Gabriella ''s relationship is strained when Troy sees Ryan with Gabriella
      , sparking jealousy . Owing to a `` promise '''' from Troy , he and Sharpay
      practice their song for the Midsummer Night ''s Talent Show ( `` You Are The
      Music In Me ( Sharpay Version ) '''' ) . </P> <P> When Sharpay discovers that
      Ryan and the Wildcats are putting together their own performance in the show

      Nobel Prize Medal for Physics presented to Edward Victor Appleton in 1947 <P>
      The Nobel Prize in Physics ( Swedish : Nobelpriset i fysik ) is awarded annually
      by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to scientists in the various fields
      of physics . It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will
      of Alfred Nobel ( who died in 1896 ) , awarded for outstanding contributions
      in physics . As dictated by Nobel ''s will , the award is administered by the
      Nobel Foundation and awarded by a committee that consists of five members elected
      by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences . The award is presented in Stockholm
      at an annual ceremony on December 10 , the anniversary of Nobel ''s death .
      Each recipient receives a medal , a diploma and a monetary award prize that
      has varied throughout the years . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide )

      ( edit ) </H2> <P> The first Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded in 1901 to Wilhelm
      Conrad Röntgen , of Germany , who received 150,782 SEK , which is equal to 7,731,004
      SEK in December 2007 . John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice
      -- in 1956 and 1972 . Maria Skłodowska - Curie also won two Nobel Prizes , for
      physics in 1903 and chemistry in 1911 . William Lawrence Bragg was , until October
      2014 , the youngest ever Nobel laureate ; he won the prize in 1915 at the age
      of 25 . Two women have won the prize : Curie and Maria Goeppert - Mayer ( 1963
      ) . As of 2017 , the prize has been awarded to 206 individuals . There have
      been six years in which the Nobel Prize in Physics was not awarded ( 1916 ,
      1931 , 1934 , 1940 -- 1942 ) . </P> <H2> Laureates ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr>

      musical fantasy - adventure film produced by Walt Disney Productions and based
      on the Alice books by Lewis Carroll . The 13th of Disney ''s animated features
      , the film premiered in New York City and London on July 26 , 1951 . The film
      features the voices of Kathryn Beaumont as Alice , Sterling Holloway as the
      Cheshire Cat , Verna Felton as the Queen of Hearts , and Ed Wynn as the Mad
      Hatter . </P> <P> Walt Disney first attempted unsuccessfully to adapt Alice
      into an animated feature film during the 1930s . However , he finally revived
      the idea in the 1940s . The film was originally intended to be a live - action
      / animated film ; however , Disney decided to make it an all - animated feature
      in 1946 . The theme song of the same name has since become a jazz standard .
      While the film was critically panned on its initial release , the movie proved
      to be ahead of its time and has since been regarded as one of Disney ''s greatest
      animated classics , notably one of the biggest cult classics in the animation
      medium , as well as one of the best film adaptations of Alice . </P> <P> </P>

      <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> On a riverbank , Alice spots a White Rabbit
      in a waistcoat passing by , exclaiming that he is `` late for a very important
      date '''' . She gives chase , following him into a large rabbit hole . She sees
      him leave through a tiny door , whose talking knob advises her to shrink to
      an appropriate height by drinking from a bottle marked `` Drink Me '''' . She
      does so and floats out through the keyhole in a sea of her own tears , which
      she cried after eating a biscuit marked `` Eat Me '''' caused her to grow very
      large . As she continues to follow the Rabbit , she meets numerous characters
      , including Tweedledum and Tweedledee , who recount the tale of `` The Walrus
      and the Carpenter '''' . </P> <P> Alice tracks the Rabbit to his house ; he
      sends her to retrieve his gloves after mistaking her for his housemaid . While
      searching for them , she eats another cookie marked `` Eat Me '''' from his
      cookie canister and grows large again , getting stuck in the house . Thinking
      she is a monster , he brings the Dodo over to help him get rid of her . When
      the Dodo decides to burn the house down , Alice escapes by eating a carrot from
      the Rabbit ''s garden , which causes her to shrink to three inches tall , and
      continues following him . Along the way , she meets a garden of talking flowers
      who initially welcome her with a song , but then mistake her for a weed and
      order her to leave , followed by a Caterpillar , who becomes enraged after she
      tells him she is distressed at her current height , as he is the same height
      , and turns into a butterfly . Before leaving , he advises her to eat a piece
      of his mushroom to alter her size . She does so and manages to return to her
      original height , and continues following the Rabbit . </P> <P> In the woods
      , Alice meets the Cheshire Cat , who advises her to visit the Mad Hatter or
      the March Hare to find out where the Rabbit is . She encounters both , along
      with the Dormouse , at the Hare ''s house having a mad tea party and celebrating
      their `` unbirthday '''' . They celebrate her unbirthday too , but she becomes
      frustrated at them interrupting her every time she tries to speak . As she is
      about to leave , the Rabbit appears , continuing to exclaim that he is late
      ; the Hatter examines his pocket watch and says it is `` two days slow ''''
      , and attempts to `` fix '''' it by filling it with food and tea but ends up
      having to destroy it after it goes `` mad '''' . The Rabbit laments that his
      watch was an `` unbirthday present '''' , and the Hatter and Hare sing `` The
      Unbirthday Song '''' to him before throwing him back into the woods . Fed up
      with the nonsense , Alice decides to go home , but her surroundings have completely
      changed and she gets lost . Fearing she is lost forever , she sits on a rock
      sobbing . </P> <P> The Cheshire Cat reappears and advises Alice to ask the Queen
      of Hearts for directions home , showing her a `` shortcut '''' to the King and
      tyrannical Queen ''s castle . The Queen orders the beheading of a trio of playing
      card gardeners who mistakenly planted white roses instead of red ones , and
      invites ( or rather forces ) Alice to play against her in a croquet match ,
      in which live flamingos , card guards and hedgehogs are used as equipment .
      The animals and card guards rig the game in favor of the Queen . The Cat appears
      again and plays a trick on the Queen , causing her to fall over . The Cat disappears
      in time to make it look like Alice was the prankster , but before the Queen
      can order her execution , the King suggests they have a trial . </P> <P> At
      Alice ''s trial , the Mad Hatter , March Hare and Dormouse are called to the
      stand as witnesses , briefly celebrating the Queen ''s unbirthday and giving
      her a headpiece as a present , which turns into the Cat . Chaos ensues when
      the frightened Dormouse runs around the courtroom . As the Queen orders Alice
      ''s execution , Alice eats the pieces of the Caterpillar ''s mushroom she saved
      and grows large again . The King and Queen order her to leave the courthouse
      , but she refuses and insults the Queen . As she does so , she returns to her
      normal size , and the Queen orders her execution . Alice flees , and the Queen
      , King , card guards and other characters give chase . When she reaches the
      small door she encountered at the beginning of the film , he shows her that
      she is actually already outside , asleep . She yells at herself to wake up ;
      she does and leaves the riverbank to go home for tea . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit

      ( edit ) </H3> <P> The history of Walt Disney ''s association with Lewis Carroll
      ''s Alice books ( Alice ''s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking
      - Glass ) stretches all the way back to his childhood . Like many children of
      the time he was familiar with the Alice books and had read them as a school
      boy . </P> <P> In 1923 , Disney was still a 21 - year - old filmmaker trying
      to make a name for himself by working at the Laugh - O - Gram Studio in Kansas
      City , making the unsuccessful short cartoon series by the name of Newman Laugh
      - O - Grams . The last of Newman Laugh - O - Grams was called Alice ''s Wonderland
      , which was loosely inspired by the Alice books . The short featured a live
      - action girl ( Virginia Davis ) interacting in an animated world . Faced with
      business problems , however , the Laugh - O - Gram Studio went bankrupt in July
      1923 , and the film was never released to the general public . However , Disney
      left for Hollywood and used the film as a sort of pilot to show to potential
      distributors . Margaret J. Winkler of Winkler Pictures agreed to distribute
      the Alice Comedies , and Disney partnered with his older brother Roy O. Disney
      and re-hired Kansas City co-workers including Ub Iwerks , Rudolph Ising , Friz
      Freleng , Carman Maxwell and Hugh Harman to form Disney Bros. Studios ( later
      Walt Disney Productions ) . The series began in 1924 before being retired in
      1927 . </P> <P> In 1932 , Disney began playing with the idea of making an animated
      feature film and repeatedly turned to the idea of making a feature - length
      animated / live - action version of Alice starring Mary Pickford , and even
      purchased the rights to Sir John Tenniel ''s illustrations ( still under copyright
      at the time ) . However , these plans were eventually scrapped in favor of Snow
      White and the Seven Dwarfs , mainly because Disney was put off by Paramount
      ''s 1933 live - action adaptation . However , Disney did not completely abandon
      the idea of adapting Alice , and in 1936 made the Mickey Mouse cartoon Thru
      the Mirror . </P> <P> In 1938 , after the enormous success of Snow White , Disney
      revived the idea of making an Alice feature and officially registered the title
      Alice in Wonderland with the Motion Picture Association of America and hired
      storyboard artist Al Perkins and art director David S. Hall to develop the story
      and concept art for the film . A storyreel was complete in 1939 , but Walt was
      not pleased as he felt that Hall ''s drawings resembled Tenniel ''s drawings
      too closely making them too difficult to animate and that the overall tone of
      Perkins '' script was too grotesque and dark . Realising the amount of work
      needed for Alice in Wonderland , as well as the economic devastation of the
      World War II and the production demands of Pinocchio , Fantasia , and Bambi
      , Walt shelved production on Alice in Wonderland shortly after the screening
      . </P> <P> In 1945 , shortly after the war ended , Disney once again revived
      Alice in Wonderland and assigned British author Aldous Huxley to re-write the
      script . However , Walt felt that Huxley ''s version was too much of a literal
      adaptation of Carroll ''s book . Background artist Mary Blair submitted some
      concept drawings for Alice in Wonderland . Blair ''s paintings moved away from
      Tenniel ''s sketchy illustrations by taking a modernist stance , using bold
      and unreal colors . Walt liked Blair ''s designs , and the script was re-written
      to focus on comedy , music , and the whimsical side to Carroll ''s book . </P>
      <P> Disney toyed with the idea of having a live - action / animated version
      of Alice in Wonderland ( in a similar fashion to his Alice Comedies ) that would
      star Ginger Rogers and would utilize the recently developed sodium vapor process
      . Lisa Davis Waltz ( who would later voice Anita Radcliffe in One Hundred and
      One Dalmatians ) and Luana Patten were also considered for the role of Alice
      . However , Walt soon realized that he could only do justice to the book by
      making an all - animated feature , and in 1946 , work began on an all - animated
      version of Alice in Wonderland . </P> <H3> Writing ( edit ) </H3> <P> Through
      various drafts of the script , many sequences that were present in Caroll ''s
      book drifted in and out of the story . However , Walt insisted that the scenes
      themselves keep close to those in the novel since most of its humor is in the
      writing . </P> <P> One omitted scene from the 1939 treatment of the film occurred
      outside the Duchess '' manor , where The Fish Footman is giving a message to
      The Frog Footman to take to the Duchess saying that she is invited to play croquet
      with The Queen of Hearts . Alice overhears this and sneaks into the kitchen
      of the manor , where she finds the Duchess '' Cook maniacally cooking and the
      Duchess nursing her baby . The cook is spraying pepper all over the room causing
      the Duchess and Alice to sneeze and the Baby to cry . After a quick conversation
      between Alice and the Duchess , the quick - tempered Cook starts throwing pots
      and pans at the noisy baby . Alice rescues the baby , but as she leaves the
      house the baby turns into a pig and runs away . The scene was scrapped for pacing
      reasons . </P> <P> Another scene that was deleted from a later draft occurred
      in Tulgey Wood , where Alice encountered what appeared to be a sinister - looking
      Jabberwock hiding in the dark , before revealing himself as a comical looking
      dragon - like beast with bells and factory whistles on his head . A song , ``
      Beware the Jabberwock '''' , was also written . However , the scene was scrapped
      in favor of The Walrus and the Carpenter poem . Out of a desire to keep the
      Jabberwocky poem in the film , it was made to replace an original song for the
      Cheshire Cat , `` I ''m Odd '''' . </P> <P> Another deleted scene in Tulgey
      Wood shows Alice consulting with The White Knight , who was meant to be somewhat
      of a caricature of Walt Disney . Although Walt liked the scene , he felt it
      was better if Alice learned her lesson by herself , hence the song `` Very Good
      Advice '''' . </P> <P> Other characters , such as The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon
      were discarded for pacing reasons . </P> <H3> Music ( edit ) </H3> <P> In an
      effort to retain some of Carroll ''s imaginative verses and poems , Disney commissioned
      top songwriters to compose songs built around them for use in the film . A record
      number of potential songs were written for the film , based on Carroll ''s verses
      -- over 30 -- and many of them found a way into the film , if only for a few
      brief moments . Alice in Wonderland would boast the greatest number of songs
      included in any Disney film , but because some of them last for mere seconds
      ( like `` How Do You Do and Shake Hands '''' , `` We ''ll Smoke the Monster
      Out '''' , `` '' Twas Brillig '''' , `` The Caucus Race '''' , and others )
      , this fact is frequently overlooked . The original song that Alice was to sing
      in the beginning was titled `` Beyond the Laughing Sky '''' . The song , like
      so many other dropped songs , was not used by the producers . However , the
      composition was kept and the lyrics were changed . It later became the title
      song for Peter Pan ( which was in production at the same time ) , `` The Second
      Star to the Right '''' . </P> <P> The title song , composed by Sammy Fain ,
      has become a jazz standard , first adopted by jazz pianist Dave Brubeck ; featured
      first in 1952 , then on his 1957 Columbia album Dave Digs Disney . </P> <P>
      Izumi Yukimura sang her own theme song for the Japanese release of the film
      . </P> <P> The song , `` In a World of My Own , '''' is included on the orange
      disc of Classic Disney : 60 Years of Musical Magic . </P> <H2> Release and reception
      ( edit ) </H2> <P> At the time , these creative decisions were met with great
      criticism from Carroll fans , as well as from British film and literary critics
      who accused Disney of `` Americanizing '''' a great work of English literature
      . Disney was not surprised by the critical reception to Alice in Wonderland
      -- his version of Alice was intended for large family audiences , not literary
      critics -- but despite all the long years of thought and effort , the film met
      with a lukewarm response at the box office and was a sharp disappointment in
      its initial release , earning an estimated $2.4 million at the US box office
      in 1951 . </P> <P> Though not an outright disaster , the film was never re-released
      theatrically in Disney ''s lifetime , airing instead every so often on network
      television . In fact , Alice in Wonderland aired as the second episode of Walt
      Disney ''s Disneyland TV series on ABC in 1954 , in a severely edited version
      cut down to less than an hour . In The Disney Films , Leonard Maltin relates
      animator Ward Kimball felt the film failed because `` it suffered from too many
      cooks -- directors . Here was a case of five directors each trying to top the
      other guy and make his sequence the biggest and craziest in the show . This
      had a self - canceling effect on the final product . '''' Walt Disney himself
      felt that the film failed because there was no `` warmth '''' in Alice ''s character
      . </P> <P> Almost two decades after its original release , after the North American
      success of George Dunning ''s animated film Yellow Submarine ( 1968 ) , Disney
      ''s version of Alice in Wonderland suddenly found itself in vogue with the times
      . In fact , because of Mary Blair ''s art direction and the long - standing
      association of Carroll ''s Alice in Wonderland with the drug culture , the feature
      was re-discovered as something of a `` head film '''' ( along with Fantasia
      and The Three Caballeros ) among the college - aged and was shown in various
      college towns across the country . Disney resisted this association , and even
      withdrew prints of the film from universities , but then , in 1974 , Disney
      gave Alice in Wonderland its first theatrical re-release ever , and the company
      even promoted it as a film in tune with the `` psychedelic '''' times ( mostly
      from the hit song `` White Rabbit '''' performed by Jefferson Airplane ) . This
      re-release was so successful it warranted a subsequent re-release in 1981 .
      Its first UK re-release was on July 26 , 1979 . </P> <P> Later , with the advent
      of the home video market , Disney chose to make Alice in Wonderland one of the
      first titles available for the rental market on VHS and Beta and for retail
      sale on RCA ''s short - lived CED Videodisc format . The film was released on
      October 15 , 1981 on VHS , CED Videodisc , and Betamax and May 28 , 1986 on
      VHS , Betamax , and Laserdisc in the Walt Disney Classics , ( though it was
      mastered for tape in 1985 ) , staying in general release ever since , with a
      40th Anniversary video release in 1991 ( this and the 1986 video release were
      in Disney ''s Classics Collection ) , followed by an October 28 , 1994 October
      14 , 1997 VHS and Laserdisc release as a part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece
      Collection. VHS and Laserdisc release as a part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece
      Collection . It was released on Region 1 DVD on July 4 , 2000 ( under the Gold
      Classic Collection DVD series ) . A fully restored two - disc `` Masterpiece
      Edition '''' was released on January 27 , 2004 , including the full hour - long
      episode of the Disney television show with Kathryn Beaumont , Edgar Bergen ,
      Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd , Bobby Driscoll and others that promoted
      the film , computer games , deleted scenes , songs and related materials , which
      went back on moratorium in January 2009 . Disney released a 2 - disc special
      `` Un-Anniversary '''' edition DVD on March 30 , 2010 in order to promote the
      then - new Tim Burton film . The movie was released in a Blu - ray / DVD combo
      on February 1 , 2011 to celebrate its 60th anniversary featuring a new HD restoration
      of the movie and many released bonus features . Disney re-released the film
      on Blu - ray and DVD on April 26 , 2016 to celebrate the film ''s 65th anniversary
      . </P> <P> On the film aggregator website , Rotten Tomatoes , the overall rating
      of the film is a `` fresh '''' 79 % from 28 critical reviews with an average
      rating of 6.4 / 10 . Its consensus states that `` A good introduction to Lewis
      Carroll ''s classic , Alice in Wonderland boasts some of the Disney canon ''s
      most surreal and twisted images . '''' </P> <P> The film was nominated for an
      Academy Award for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture , but lost to An American
      in Paris . </P> <H2> Soundtrack ( edit ) </H2> <P> The film soundtrack was first
      released on LP record on July 28 , 1951 . The soundtrack was re-released on

      had much less of an effect on the park , only inspiring Mad T Party , a nighttime
      event at Disney California Adventure . </P> <H3> Video games ( edit ) </H3>
      <P> In Disney ''s Villains '' Revenge , the Queen of Hearts is one of the villains
      who tries to turn the ending to her story to where she finally cuts off Alice
      ''s head . Mickey Mousecapade features various characters from the film . The
      Japanese version , in fact , is based very heavily on the film , with almost
      every reference in the game coming from the film . </P> <P> A video game version
      of the film was released on Game Boy Color by Nintendo of America on October
      4 , 2000 in North America . Additionally , in the video games Kingdom Hearts
      and Kingdom Hearts : Chain of Memories , Wonderland is a playable world . Alice
      is also a major character in the overall plot of the first game due to her role
      as one of seven `` Princesses of Heart '''' . Other characters from the movie
      that appear include the Queen of Hearts , the Cheshire Cat , the White Rabbit
      , the Doorknob , the Caterpillar ( V Cast only ) , and the Deck of Cards . The
      Mad Hatter and the March Hare appear in portrait form as well . All except the
      Doorknob also appear in Chain of Memories , albeit in the form of illusions
      made from the main character ''s memory . While the world is absent in Kingdom
      Hearts II , it returns in Kingdom Hearts 358 / 2 Days and Kingdom Hearts coded
      , the latter featuring a digitized version of the world originating from data
      in Jiminy Cricket ''s royal journal . </P> <P> In Toy Story 3 : The Video Game
      , the Mad Hatter ''s hat is one of the hats you can have the townsfolk wear
      . In Kinect Disneyland Adventures , Alice , Mad Hatter , White Rabbit , and
      the Queen of Hearts make appearances . </P> <P> In Disney Infinity there are
      power discs based on Alice in Wonderland . </P> <P> Several characters of the
      movie make appearances throughout the Epic Mickey - games . For example , the
      cards are seen throughout Mickeyjunk Mountain in the original Epic Mickey ,
      Alice appears as a statue carrying a projector screen in Epic Mickey 2 and Alice
      , the Mad Hatter , the Cheshire Cat and the Queen of Hearts appear as unlockable
      characters in Epic Mickey : Power of Illusion . </P> <H2> References ( edit

      </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Deadpool 2 is an upcoming American superhero film based
      on the Marvel Comics character Deadpool , distributed by 20th Century Fox .
      It is intended to be the eleventh installment in the X-Men film series , and
      a sequel to the 2016 film Deadpool . The film is directed by David Leitch from

      . In Deadpool 2 , Deadpool forms the team X-Force to protect a young mutant
      from Cable . </P> <P> Plans for a sequel to Deadpool began before that film
      ''s release , and were confirmed in February 2016 . Though the original creative
      team of Reynolds , Reese , Wernick , and director Tim Miller were quickly set
      to return for the second film , Miller left the project in October 2016 due
      to creative differences with Reynolds , and was soon replaced by Leitch . An
      extensive casting search took place to fill the role of Cable , with Brolin
      ultimately cast ; the casting of Beetz as Domino was also noteworthy . Filming
      took place in British Columbia , Canada , from June to October 2017 . During
      filming , stunt woman Joi `` SJ '''' Harris died in a motorcycle accident .
      </P> <P> Deadpool 2 is scheduled to be released in the United States on May

      <P> </P> <H2> Premise </H2> <P> Deadpool forms a team of mutants called the
      X-Force to protect young mutant Russell from the time - traveling soldier Cable
      . </P> <H2> Cast </H2> <Ul> <Li> Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson / Deadpool : A
      wisecracking mercenary with accelerated healing but severe scarring over his
      body after undergoing an experimental regenerative mutation . He forms the X-Force
      , a team of mutants . </Li> <Li> Josh Brolin as Nathan Summers / Cable : A time
      travelling cybernetic mutant soldier , `` in many ways the opposite of Deadpool
      '''' . Director David Leitch called the dynamic between Cable and Deadpool ``
      sort of classic buddy - cop fare '''' , and compared them to the characters
      portrayed by Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy , respectively , in 48 Hrs. ( 1982
      ) . Brolin signed a four - film deal to play the character , and described his
      appearance here as just the introduction for the character , with `` three more
      movies to reveal more . '''' </Li> <Li> Morena Baccarin as Vanessa : An escort
      and Wilson ''s fiancée . </Li> <Li> Julian Dennison as Russell : A young mutant
      being hunted by Cable . Dennison was the only actor that the creative team considered
      for the role , with Russell `` sort of a tailor - made character '''' for the
      actor . </Li> <Li> Zazie Beetz as Neena Thurman / Domino : A mercenary with
      the mutant ability to manipulate luck , who joins Deadpool ''s X-Force team
      . Leitch described the film ''s version of the character as Beetz '' own ``
      real fun interesting take '''' . Beetz began `` doing strength conditioning
      , so that ''s like working out everyday '''' when she got the role , for which
      she has to `` be shooting guns , I fight and a lot of that movement is full
      body and physical . '''' </Li> <Li> T.J. Miller as Weasel : Wilson ''s best
      friend , the owner of a bar frequented by mercenaries . </Li> <Li> Brianna Hildebrand
      as Negasonic Teenage Warhead : A teenage X-Man with the mutant power to detonate
      atomic bursts from her body , she is now a `` new level of X-Men '''' after
      being a trainee in the first film . Hildebrand felt that `` it ''s cool that
      she ''s grown and matured and she still has so much of this essence of a punk
      kid '''' from the first film , and added that the character would have a ``
      cooler '''' costume in the sequel . </Li> <Li> Jack Kesy as Black Tom Cassidy
      : A mutant who can manipulate energy through plants . </Li> <Li> Stefan Kapičić
      as the voice of Colossus : An X-Man with the mutant ability to transform his
      entire body into organic steel . Kapičić described Colossus as one of the most
      important characters in the film , requiring a more intense process for Kapičić
      during recording for the character . He explained that Colossus would continue
      to try make Deadpool a better person and potential X-Man after doing so in the
      first film . </Li> </Ul> <P> Leslie Uggams and Karan Soni return from the first
      film as Deadpool ''s elderly roommate Blind Al and the taxi driver Dopinder
      , respectively . The X-Force team also includes Terry Crews as Bedlam , Lewis
      Tan as Shatterstar , and Rob Delaney as Peter . Shioli Kutsuna , Eddie Marsan
      , and Bill Skarsgård have been cast in undisclosed roles . </P> <H2> Production
      </H2> <H3> Development </H3> <P> Producer Simon Kinberg revealed in September
      2015 that discussions had begun regarding ideas for a sequel to Deadpool , which
      was set to be released in February 2016 . One idea was for the film to introduce
      the character Cable , who had previously been looked at to appear in the first
      Deadpool , and X-Men : Days of Future Past before that . Cable ''s inclusion
      in the potential sequel was confirmed by the character Deadpool , breaking the
      fourth wall , in the post-credit scene of the first film . Domino , a character
      with connections to Cable in the comics , was also believed to be featured in
      the sequel . By the first film ''s release , 20th Century Fox had green - lit
      a sequel , with writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick returning to write the
      screenplay . Though director Tim Miller and producer / star Ryan Reynolds were
      not confirmed for the sequel at the time , Fox was `` intent on keeping the
      creative team together '''' . Miller and Reynolds '' involvement was confirmed
      at the 2016 CinemaCon that April , though Miller had still not formally signed
      on to direct the sequel yet . He began work developing the script with the writers
      , while Reynolds had signed a new contract granting him `` casting approval
      and other creative controls '''' . </P> It has to tonally and stylistically
      be as fresh and original ( as the first film ) . That ''s a big challenge especially
      because they had 10 years to gestate on the first movie and we do n''t have
      that kind of time on the second movie . That ''s the biggest mandate going (
      into ) the second film ... we have to resist the temptation to make it bigger
      . <P> -- Producer Simon Kinberg on approaching Deadpool 2 </P> <P> In June 2016
      , Kinberg said that a completed draft from Wernick and Rheese was expected ``
      soon '''' , and that they were looking to begin filming the sequel at the beginning
      of 2017 . By August , Kyle Chandler was believed to be in the running to portray
      Cable . Testing of actresses for Domino had also begun by October , with the
      shortlist of actresses under consideration including Lizzy Caplan , Mary Elizabeth
      Winstead , Sienna Miller , Sofia Boutella , Stephanie Sigman , Sylvia Hoeks
      , Mackenzie Davis , Ruby Rose , Eve Hewson , and Kelly Rohrbach . The producers
      were particularly interested in casting a black or Latina actress in the role
      . </P> <P> At the end of October , Miller left the film over `` mutual creative
      differences '''' with Reynolds . The rift between the pair was reportedly based
      on several factors , including Reynolds '' expanded creative control over the
      sequel ; Miller ''s wish for a more stylized follow - up than the first film
      , versus Reynolds '' focus `` on the raunchy comedy style that earned the first
      movie its R rating '''' ; and Miller ''s intention to cast Chandler as Cable
      , which Reynolds opposed . Fox ultimately backed `` its marketable star ''''
      over Miller , who had made his directorial debut with the first film . Miller
      denied these reported reasons , while Reynolds said , `` All I can really add
      is that I ''m sad to see him off the film . Tim ''s brilliant and nobody worked
      harder on Deadpool than he did . '''' A week after Miller ''s departure , Fox
      was looking at David Leitch , Drew Goddard , Magnus Martens , and Rupert Sanders
      as potential replacements for the director . Leitch was the `` strong frontrunner
      '''' for the role , and signed on to direct a month later . Reynolds , a fan
      of Leitch ''s John Wick , said the director `` really understands those Deadpool
      sensibilities and where we need to take the franchise from here . '''' He added
      that Leitch `` can make a movie on an ultra tight minimal budget look like it
      was shot for 10 -- 15 times what it cost . '''' </P> <H3> Pre-production </H3>
      <P> Reese and Wernick had completed multiple drafts of the script by January
      2017 , saying , `` It ''s taken different twists and turns , but it ''s really
      coalescing '''' ; the film was still on track to begin filming that year . The
      pair felt a responsibility to explore the team X-Force , which includes Deadpool
      , Cable , and Domino in the comics , with Reese saying the sequel ''s purpose
      `` is not to set up X-Force ( but ) it will likely set up X-Force . '''' He
      did clarify that though the film will be `` populated with a lot of characters
      ... it is still Deadpool ''s movie '''' . The pair confirmed that Stefan Kapičić
      ''s Colossus , Brianna Hildebrand ''s Negasonic Teenage Warhead , and Karan
      Soni ''s Dopinder would be returning from the first film to `` make at least
      an appearance '''' , and that the film would not be exploring the details of
      Cable ''s convoluted comic origins . By the next month , it had been noted that
      there had been few announcements from Fox regarding the film , and that a release
      date had not yet been set which was seen as unusual for sequels to popular films
      ( often studios `` announce sequels far too soon and with no idea what will
      happen '''' ) , with the issue deemed to be the film ''s script . Reynolds ,
      Reese , and Wernick had been `` bunkered down , working on the script together
      , trying to cross the finish line and create something everyone is excited to
      make '''' . At that time , Goddard joined the project to consult on the script
      . </P> <P> By the beginning of March 2017 , Michael Shannon had been in the
      running to portray Cable , but no longer could due to a scheduling conflict
      . David Harbour had screen - tested for the role , and Pierce Brosnan was believed
      to be in negotiations for a part in the film , potentially Cable . Reynolds
      announced shortly after that Zazie Beetz had been cast as Domino . Later in
      the month , Shannon was in the running to portray Cable again , and was considered
      the frontrunner , with Fox also looking at a shortlist of other actors that
      included Harbour . Brad Pitt had also been considered for the role , and expressed
      interest in taking it , but had `` moved on '''' . Leitch soon addressed the
      potential casting of these actors , saying Shannon `` would make an incredible
      Cable ... If that happens , I would be through the roof '''' ; and on Pitt ,
      `` We had a great meeting with Brad , he was incredibly interested in the property
      . Things did n''t work out schedule-wise . He ''s a fan , and we love him ,
      and I think he would ''ve made an amazing Cable . '''' At the end of March ,
      Morena Baccarin confirmed her return from the first film as Vanessa , and expressed
      interest in exploring the character ''s Copycat persona from the comics in the
      sequel . Josh Brolin emerged as a `` surprise contender '''' to play Cable in
      April , ahead of Shannon and Harbour , and was officially cast in the role .
      Brolin also portrays the Marvel Comics character Thanos , in the Marvel Cinematic
      Universe . Leslie Uggams confirmed that she would be reprising her role of Blind
      Al from the first film , while Fox gave the sequel a June 1 , 2018 release date
      . </P> <P> Noting the release date , Leitch wanted to ensure that the film ``
      was worthy of a summer tentpole movie , and we knew we were going to be wedged
      in between some big films '''' , specifically wanting to expand the action and
      make the general feeling of the film `` bigger '''' than the first one . However
      , he wanted the film to have the same DNA as the original `` in terms of the
      tone , and the fun ... I love that challenge '''' of combining that with the
      increased scope . The film uses Deadpool ''s fourth wall - breaking to reference
      this release period , with Leitch calling these comments `` definitely fresh
      and timely when they come up . '''' In May 2017 , Fox was reportedly looking
      to use a post-credits scene at the end of Deadpool 2 to introduce several other
      members of X-Force who would go on to star alongside Reynolds , Brolin , and
      Beetz in an X-Force film . Casting for the characters -- Sunspot , Feral , and
      Shatterstar -- would take place over the coming months , though Reese denied
      the accuracy of this report . Later , T.J. Miller confirmed that he would return
      from the first film as Weasel , and described the sequel as `` even more weaselicious
      '''' than the first . He noted that Reynolds and the writers had `` really put
      the time in on the script '''' to meet their own expectations for the sequel
      as well as those of fans . Jack Kesy also joined the cast , as Black Tom Cassidy
      . In June , Shioli Kutsuna was cast in a key role for the film . </P> <H3> Filming
      </H3> <P> Initial filming had begun by June 17 , 2017 , at Hatley Castle in
      Victoria , Canada , which is used to portray the X-Mansion in the X-Men films
      . Principal photography began in Vancouver on June 26 , under the working title
      Love Machine . Jonathan Sela served as cinematographer for the film . At the
      end of June , Reynolds revealed that Julian Dennison had been cast in the film
      . The next month , T.J. Miller said that he found the sequel to be funnier than
      the first film , and that `` it ''s not going to be the same movie in a different
      location ( like The Hangover Part II ) . It ''s got different stakes , different
      things happen , some pretty tragic , dark shit happens in the first part of
      the film , in the beginning , and the rest of the film is kind of dealing with
      that . '''' By then , Kapičić had been working with Leitch on the set , and
      expected to continue contributing to Colossus through to April 2018 . </P> <P>
      On August 14 , stunt woman Joi `` SJ '''' Harris died in a motorcycle accident
      after losing control and crashing into Shaw Tower . Harris , the first African
      - American female professional road racer , was working on the film as a stunt
      performer for the first time and had only joined the production a week before
      . Harris was not wearing a helmet because the character she was portraying ,
      Domino , does not wear one in the scene , and there had not been time since
      she joined the film to create one for her to fit underneath the Domino wig .
      She had two full days of rehearsing the stunt as well as five more attempts
      on the day of the accident . Veteran stunt double Melissa Stubbs had been available
      and willing to do the stunt , but the inexperienced Harris was preferred due
      to her skin color being a match for Beetz . This decision was criticized by
      multiple stunt professionals , with many noting that Harris '' experiences racing
      motorcycles did not necessarily qualify her as an able stunt performer . Production
      on the film was shut down immediately after the incident , but resumed two days
      later . With this news also came reports that the film ''s crew were `` enduring
      very long hours '''' and were `` exhausted by the schedule '''' , with a member
      of the studio confirming that some days had gone beyond the scheduled 12 --
      13 hours filming , up to 15 -- plus hours . </P> <P> Earlier in August , Reynolds
      revealed that Rob Delaney was at the film ''s set , and Eddie Marsan revealed
      that he was also on set for a role in the film later in the month . Filming
      in Vancouver was expected to last until October 6 , with production on Deadpool
      2 being officially completed on October 14 . Discussing the film ''s action
      , having previously worked as a stunt coordinator , Leitch said that all stunts
      are `` variations on a theme '''' with the same basic elements , but Deadpool
      allows you to `` subvert those basics , and there ''s an expectation for a classic
      gag , but oops , maybe you get something else . '''' He also felt that introducing
      Domino gave the film unique opportunities for action sequences taking advantage
      of her luck - based abilities , as well as focusing on Deadpool ''s healing
      abilities and trying to use those to create interesting action . </P> <H3> Post-production
      </H3> <P> Fox revealed in November that the film was technically untitled at
      that point , and not officially known as Deadpool 2 as had been assumed ; the
      studio was temporarily referring to the film as The Untitled Deadpool Sequel
      . In January 2018 , the film ''s release was moved up to May 18 , 2018 . A month
      later , Terry Crews was revealed to have a role in the film , the character
      Shatterstar was confirmed to be appearing , and the production returned to Vancouver
      for six days of reshoots under a new working title , Daisy . </P> <P> While
      some reports emerged by mid-March claiming that the reshoots were due to poor
      audience responses during test screenings of the film , and consisted of sweeping
      changes , the film was soon confirmed to be testing better than the original
      did , up to 98 out of 100 over three different tests ( compared to a maximum
      score of 91 during tests of the first film ) . Because of this , the reshoots
      were adding more of the elements that audiences responded positively to , including
      additional material featuring Cable and Domino . By the end of the month , two
      hours - worth of filming had taken place in Los Angeles for a then - secret
      cameo appearance , and the film ''s first full trailer was released . Officially
      titling the film Deadpool 2 , the trailer also revealed that Crews was portraying
      Bedlam ; that Delaney was in the film , portraying Peter ; and that Bill Skarsgård
      also had a role . The film ''s final trailer , released a month later , confirmed
      that Lewis Tan would portray Shatterstar , joining Domino , Bedlam , and Peter
      as members of the X-Force in the film . </P> <H2> Music </H2> <P> Deadpool composer
      Junkie XL chose not to return for the sequel due to Miller ''s departure . In
      October 2017 , Tyler Bates was hired to write the score for the film . </P>
      <H2> Release </H2> <P> Deadpool 2 is set to be released in the United States
      on May 18 , 2018 . It was previously scheduled for release on June 1 of that
      year . </P> <H3> Marketing </H3> <P> For the Fox presentation at CineEurope
      2017 in June , Reynolds made a video message featuring himself in costume as
      Deadpool from the film ''s set . The first teaser poster , which pays homage
      to Norman Rockwell ''s 1943 painting Freedom from Want , was released that November
      . Justin Carter of Comic Book Resources found it `` oddly appropriate for Deadpool
      2 to co-opt ( this ) iconic work for a modern pop culture audience '''' as it
      is `` true to Deadpool ''s incredibly referential nature . '''' Eric Diaz of
      Nerdist said , `` It strikes exactly the irreverent tone you ''d expect for
      the Deadpool sequel . '''' The first footage from the film debuted the following
      week , at the end of a video where Reynolds ( in - character as Deadpool ) parodies
      Bob Ross and his television show The Joy of Painting . The video was described
      by The Hollywood Reporter ''s Ryan Parker as `` completely out of left field
      '''' and setting the tone perfectly for the film , though his colleague Graeme
      McMillan was less positive due to not knowing of Ross ( Deadpool co-creator
      Fabian Nicieza thought the fact that many in the audience would n''t know of
      Ross made the video `` exactly the kind of quirky pop culture choice that works
      perfectly for Deadpool '''' ) . Parker added , `` This trailer only showed a
      few seconds from the film , but fans will be talking about it all day '''' because
      of the presentation , unlike `` any other trailer which would have shown so
      little of the product . '''' </P> <P> Rather than pay for an expensive advertisement
      spot during Super Bowl LII , the film ''s official Twitter account was used
      to `` live tweet '''' the event with commentary as if the character Deadpool
      was watching it . A new trailer for the film was released later that week ,
      focusing on introducing Cable . Parker felt that `` Reynolds and company have
      completely changed the trailer game . The formula of just showing some of the
      actual movie , but with a tiny story thrown in is such an incredible marketing
      idea . '''' McMillan and their colleague Aaron Couch praised the trailer playing
      on the visual effects for Cable ''s arm not being finished , noting it as a
      joke about the visual effects to remove Henry Cavill ''s mustache from Justice
      League . The group collectively praised the overall marketing for the franchise
      , with McMillan suggesting that the campaign for the sequel may surpass that
      of the first Deadpool . A full trailer for the film , explaining its general
      plot , was released at the end of March . Forbes contributor Scott Mendelson
      called it `` pretty funny and mostly entertaining '''' , but was disappointed
      in it being a `` conventional '''' trailer compared to the more out - there
      videos previously released for the film . He explained that he thought the first
      film `` had a winning lead character and fine character - centric jokes , but
      a pretty generic origin story plot that eventually became the thing it was critiquing
      '''' , and was concerned that the sequel would turn out to be `` a more standard
      '' superhero sequel '' sell '''' . Mendelson also noted the inclusion of T.J.
      Miller in the trailer following the reveal of sexual misconduct allegations
      against the actor in late 2017 , calling it `` inevitable no matter how tarnished
      his reputation might be these days . '''' The Hollywood Reporter group also
      noted the more traditional style of the trailer , but remained generally positive
      about the film and highlighted the supporting cast for the film as appearing
      in the trailer , including Brolin , Beetz , Kutsuna , and Crews . </P> <P> Also
      in March , a Twitter account was established for the character Peter and began
      to be regularly updated with `` tweets '''' about his interests , including
      photos of the character beekeeping and preparing for his work as part of the
      X-Force team ( as seen in the film ) . A month later , Fox released the final
      trailer for the film , with Mendelson lamenting that it was as `` conventional
      '''' as the previous trailer but finding it understandable that Fox not be seen
      to be hiding the film , and ultimately felt that the trailer indicated the film
      would be `` a pretty solid comic book sequel '''' . The group at The Hollywood
      Reporter praised the final trailer as well , highlighting its references to
      X-Men Origins : Wolverine and the DC universe as well as its introduction of
      Peter . At the end of April , Leitch stated that alternate versions of jokes
      that had been cut from the film were included in the trailers , since `` only
      one can live in the movie , so we might have snuck a couple in sort of additional
      materials that people can discover . '''' As part of a promotion for the film
      with beverage company Mike ''s Harder , Sister Margaret ''s School for Wayward
      Girls -- the fictional bar featured in the films -- will be emulated in pop
      - ups at the Alligator Lounge in New York from April 26 -- 28 and the Slipper
      Clutch in Los Angeles from May 10 -- 12 . The pop - ups will respectively serve
      pizza and chimichangas , traditionally Deadpool ''s favorite food , as well
      as Deadpool - inspired Harder drinks . The campaign also includes the chance
      to win a trip to the film ''s premiere through Harder , and the Los Angeles
      pop - up will benefit the nonprofit DTLA Film Festival . </P> <H2> Box office
      projection </H2> <P> Initial box office projections for the film in March 2018
      expected it to gross $100 million over its opening weekend in the United States
      and Canada , with a final domestic total expected to be lower than that of the
      first film ( $363 million ) at around $242 million . On April 20 , 2018 , both
      Fandango and Regal Cinemas announced that Deadpool 2 was the best pre-selling
      R - rated film in their respective histories . By April 26 , opening weekend
      industry projections had reached upwards of $150 million . </P> <H2> Sequel
      </H2> <P> By November 2016 , with development underway on Deadpool 2 , Fox was
      also planning Deadpool 3 , which was said to include the team X-Force . With
      the confirmation that Leitch would direct Deadpool 2 , it was revealed that
      Fox was looking for a separate filmmaker to direct Deadpool 3 . In March 2017
      , Reese clarified that though Deadpool 2 sets - up the X-Force team , a future
      film focused on the team would be separate from Deadpool 3 , `` so I think we
      ''ll be able to take two paths . ( X-Force ) is where we ''re launching something
      bigger , but then ( Deadpool 3 is ) where we ''re contracting and staying personal
      and small . '''' After the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney
      was announced in December 2017 , Disney CEO Bob Iger said that Deadpool would
      be integrated with the Marvel Cinematic Universe under Disney , and that the
      company would be willing to make future R - rated Deadpool films `` as long
      as we let the audiences know what ''s coming '''' . </P> <H2> References </H2>
