    text: A car is being driven , in a straight line and at a uniform speed , towards
      the base of a vertical tower . The top of the tower is observed from the car
      and , in the process , it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change
      from 45 ° to 60 ° . After how much more time will this car reach the base of
      the tower ?

    - 'Explanation :

      Let the height of the building be h . Initially , he was at an angle of 450
      . tan 45 = h / distance between car and tower . h = distance between car and
      tower ( since tan 45 = 1 ) .

      Now , after 10 minutes , it travelled a certain distance , and angle changed
      to 600 .

      tan 60 = h / x x = h / √ 3

      So , in 10 minutes , it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h / √ 3 .

      10 minutes = h * ( 1 – 1 √ 3 )

      h can be travelled in 10 / ( 1 – 1 √ 3 ) .

      To travel a distance of x , which is h / √ 3 , it takes :

      h = 10 / ( 1 – 1 / √ 3 )

      h / √ 3 = 10 / √ 3 * ( 1 – 1 / √ 3 ) . Multiply numerator and denominator by
      1 + √ 3 ( conjugate of 1 - √ 3 ) . We get , x = h / √ 3 = 10 ( 1 + √ 3 ) / 2
      = 5 * ( 1 + √ 3 )

      So , it takes 5 ( 1 + √ 3 ) minutes to reach the base of the tower .
