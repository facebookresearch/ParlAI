    - The term African in the scope of this article refers to geographical or national
      origins rather than racial affiliation.
    - From the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 to 2007, an estimated total
      of 0.8 to 0.9 million Africans immigrated to the United States, accounting for
      roughly 3.3% of total immigration to the United States during this period.
    - African immigrants in the United States come from almost all regions in Africa
      and do not constitute a homogeneous group.
    - They include people from different national, linguistic, ethnic, racial, cultural
      and social backgrounds.
    - As such, African immigrants are to be distinguished from African American people,
      the latter of whom are descendants of mostly West and Central Africans who were

    - A pump is a device that moves fluids ( liquids or gases ), or sometimes slurries
      , by mechanical action.
    - 'Pumps can be classified into three major groups according to the method they
      use to move the fluid: direct lift, displacement, and gravity pumps.'
    - Pumps operate by some mechanism (typically reciprocating or rotary ), and consume

    - Lolita is a 1962 comedy-drama film by Stanley Kubrick based on the classic novel
      of the same title by Vladimir Nabokov , centres around a middle-aged man who
      becomes obsessed with a teenage girl.
    - The film stars James Mason as Humbert Humbert, Sue Lyon as Dolores Haze (Lolita)
      and Shelley Winters as Charlotte Haze with Peter Sellers as Clare Quilty.
    - Due to the MPAA 's restrictions at the time , the film toned down the more provocative
      aspects of the novel, sometimes leaving much to the audience's imagination.
    - The actress who played Lolita, Sue Lyon , was fourteen at the time of filming.
    - Kubrick later commented that, had he realized how severe the censorship limitations
      were going to be, he probably never would have made the film.

    - An antibody (Ab), also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a large Y-shaped
      protein produced by B-cells that is used by the immune system to identify and
      neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses .
    - The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target, called an antigen
      .
    - Each tip of the "Y" of an antibody contains a paratope (a structure analogous
      to a lock) that is specific for one particular epitope (similarly analogous
      to a key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with
      precision.
    - Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell
      for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target
      directly (for example, by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for
      its invasion and survival).

    - The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system
      .
    - Antibodies are secreted by a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell .
    - Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted
      from the cell, and a membrane -bound form that is attached to the surface of
      a B cell and is referred to as the B cell receptor (BCR).
    - The BCR is only found on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation
      of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories
      called plasma cells , or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember
      that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure.
    - In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to
      produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following
      antigen binding.
    - Antibodies are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large
      heavy chains and two small light chains .
    - There are several different types of antibody heavy chains, and several different
      kinds of antibodies, which are grouped into different isotypes based on which
      heavy chain they possess.
    - Five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals, which perform different
      roles, and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type
      of foreign object they encounter.
    - Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, a small region
      at the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies
      with slightly different tip structures, or antigen binding sites, to exist.
    - This region is known as the hypervariable region.
    - Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen.
    - This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize
      an equally wide variety of antigens.
    - The large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations
      of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites (or paratopes),
      followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene, which create
      further diversity.
    - Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called class switching that changes
      the base of the heavy chain to another, creating a different isotype of the
      antibody that retains the antigen specific variable region.
    - This allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the immune
      system.
