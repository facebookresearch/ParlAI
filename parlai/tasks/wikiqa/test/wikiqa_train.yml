    - A rocket engine, or simply "rocket", is a jet engine that uses only stored propellant
      mass for forming its high speed propulsive jet .
    - Rocket engines are reaction engines and obtain thrust in accordance with Newton's
      third law .
    - Since they need no external material to form their jet, rocket engines can be
      used for spacecraft propulsion as well as terrestrial uses, such as missiles
      .
    - Most rocket engines are internal combustion engines , although non-combusting
      forms also exist.
    - Rocket engines as a group have the highest exhaust velocities, are by far the
      lightest, but are the least propellant efficient of all types of jet engines.
