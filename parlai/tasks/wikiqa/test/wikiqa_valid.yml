      Search and Rescue Task Forces , consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted
      in rescue and recovery operations.
    - Within 90 minutes of the explosion, Timothy McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma
      State Trooper Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested

      was arrested, and within days both were charged.
    - Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices.
    - McVeigh's co-conspirator, Terry Nichols, had assisted in the bomb preparation.

      as its mishandling of the Waco Siege (1993) and the Ruby Ridge incident (1992),
      McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly
      fire that ended the siege at Waco.

      corpus in the United States , as well as legislation designed to increase the
      protection around federal buildings to deter future terrorist attacks.
