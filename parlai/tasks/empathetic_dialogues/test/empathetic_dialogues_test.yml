    - I hope it goes well! If it makes you feel any better, most of them are probably

    situation: I felt guilty when I was driving home one night and a person tried
      to fly into my lane, and didn't see me. I honked and they swerved back into
      their lane, slammed on their brakes, and hit the water cones.
    text: Yeah about 10 years ago I had a horrifying experience. It was 100% their
      fault but they hit the water barrels and survived. They had no injuries but
      they almost ran me off the road.

    situation: My mother stopped by my house one day and said she saw 3 dogs on the
      road, down from our house. They were starving, with ribs showing, and it was
      a mother dog and her two small puppies. Of course, my daughter wanted to bring
      them to our house, so we could feed and help them. We did, and my heart went
      out to them, as they were so sweet, but really were in a bad shape.
