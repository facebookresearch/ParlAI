    - It's amazing how many feelings and memories mementos like that can bring back.
    - Good for you! There is nothing wrong or uncool about short hair.
    - The loss of a pet is heartbreaking. I know how you feel. How old was Trevor.
    - I guess that was what you call a temporary situation. Sometimes moving on is
      required.
    - That's great news, well done.
    - Oh nice, where are you going?
    - Never late you know!
    - Yes,i am
    - That sounds amazing. What's your favorite beach to go to?
    - Oh that sounds even tougher.  It is a long time but I hope it flies by for you
      and your hubby is back home again.
    - It is, everything has to be balanced just right, or else we feel it.
    - Oh my, I hope that doesn't mean more workload for you.
    - That's too bad. What happened? Is everyone OK?
    - That is good. Where you running late
    - That makes all the difference. I am glad you were able to get out of that position.
    - Yea I know that feel, outside of a few people I knew nearly know one and avoided
      lots of people cause no one cared
    - It seems most responsible to alert someone to clean it.
    - have you asked your friends for family?
    - I love math, good luck with your exams than.
    - I am not sure I would do well in that house

    - That's interesting. Are you okay?
    - A fluffy white one? How amazing!
    - Thats so awesome! Congrats! I am hoping to get there soon.  I have a lot to

    - thats better, but sorry for the disappointment she had caused
    - Sorry, that was an error! Any way over to your conversation.Who did you cut
      off that made you feel bad?
    - Everyone can! Just gotta try.
    - That's always a good thing. It means you should get on great with your neighbors.
    - That's always tough. It's so hard to tell what other factors come into play
      in situations like that. Are you happy where you're currently at, or still looking?

    - o no what did you do?
    - I definitely recommend getting some mace and a pocket knife. Stay safe out there!
    - You only get to do it once?
    - I'm glad you didn't hit the dog!  Did he jump out at you suddenly?
    - I hate getting pulled over too. Especailly for something silly like being a
      couple of miles an hour over the speed limit
    - How'd it go
    - I agree.. Did something happen?
    - I agree, you need money for everything these days and it controls us.
    - That does sound like a really fun job. I also work freelance and would also
      like something more stable.
    - Who did you go see? And are you still friends with all the same people? I wonder
      if any of them kept their ticket stubs too.
    - how did it go
    - That must be so much fun. I have never surfed but love to be on a boat.
    - That's a good idea. I haven't done that in years. I always feel like I barely
      dodge a bullet by not getting it.
    - That's great! It's definitely a good thing when you can be yourself.
    - Congratulations!  I wish I could be published.
    - I don't know. You should have told hime when it happended. Just do it and get
      uit out of the way so you both can move past it.
    - That's great! Are you going to join your friends at the park?
    - I like my alone time too. What do you enjoy doing by yourself?
    - I understand but try not to be jealous. Good things will come to you to in its
      own time
    - i hope you do really well

    - It must've have been. Glad they are okay now.
    - Well sometimes companies make mistakes. I doubt it's anything you did.
    - Oh no, I'm so so sorry. I've always had at least one pet throughout my life,
      and they're truly part of the family.
    - Wow. That must suck. Do you like the band incubus? I missed them a couple of
      times but I saw them this year
    - I can't play those kinds of games. Too spooky for me.
    - I think your boss should give you more recognition in that case!
    - That's always a good thing. It means you should get on great with your neighbors.
    - Yeah, I had my Commodore 64 and Amiga in the late 80's. Still, the games were
      great when they worked!
    - That's ok, you did the right thing. It probably happens to lots of people.
    - Awesome! What are you going to see?
    - What kind of food does it serve? Sounds wonderful!
    - Oh no! What's wrong with your dad?
    - oh god yes i know what you mean, any ideas what you wanna do ?
    - Hopefully you'll able to get it all sorted out soon.  I'm sure when it's done
      it'll be a beautiful house.
    - That would be bad you should double check before you leave
    - I hope he continues to do well.
    - You can only do so much.  Next time I'd just let him drink on his own.
    - I am sure you will meet them
    - Wow thats nice.  What do you drive?

      other people.
    - Aww, you got to admit that is so cute as well
    - Oh no!! How did you dry them?
    - I am sorry to hear that, what happened?
    - Everyone handles stress differently. My anxiety gets so High I sometimes cancel
      my plans.
    - That is good, hopefully you find your soulmate.
    - oh god, what do you do at that time
    - They really can't. It's still no excuse though.
    - Yeah, that is a hard one to deal with.  Maybe you should give it back so you
      will not feel bad about yourself.
    - what did she get sick off , im sorry to hear that your a great to your wife
    - Oh my just the opposite LOL
    - I would make a complaint to the principal if I were you!
