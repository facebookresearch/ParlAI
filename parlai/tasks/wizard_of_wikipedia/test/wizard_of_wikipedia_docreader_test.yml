    text: 'Blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments in painting and traditional
      colour theory, as well as in the RGB colour model. It lies between violet and
      green on the spectrum of visible light. The eye perceives blue when observing
      light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres.
      Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colors; azure contains some green,
      while ultramarine contains some violet. The clear daytime sky and the deep sea
      appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering. An optical
      effect called Tyndall scattering explains blue eyes. Distant objects appear
      more blue because of another optical effect called atmospheric perspective.
      Blue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times.
      The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery
      and ornament and later, in The Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine,
      the most expensive of all pigments. In the eighth century Chinese artists used
      cobalt blue to colour fine blue and white porcelain. In the Middle Ages, European
      artists used it in the windows of Cathedrals. Europeans wore clothing coloured
      with the vegetable dye woad until it was replaced by the finer indigo from America.

      its improved passenger service between New York and Washington launched in the
      1890s, collectively dubbed the Royal Blue Line. Using variants such as the "Royal
      Limited" and "Royal Special" for individual "Royal Blue" trains, the B&O operated
      the service in partnership with the Reading Railroad and the Central Railroad
      of New Jersey. Principal intermediate cities served were Philadelphia, Wilmington,
      and Baltimore.

      for very long. Produced by Sol C. Siegel, "Blue Skies" was filmed in Technicolor

      by Irving Berlin, with most of the songs recycled from earlier works. As in
      "Holiday Inn" (1942), the film is designed to showcase Berlin''s songs.

      Oh that sounds really nice. I bet there was a lot of scenery and blue skies.'

    text: 'Harry Lillis "Bing" Crosby Jr. (; May 3, 1903 – October 14, 1977) was an
      American singer and actor. Crosby''s trademark warm bass-baritone voice made
      him one of the best-selling recording artists of all time, having sold over
      one billion analog records and tapes, and digital compact discs and downloads
      around the world. The first multimedia star, from 1931 to 1954 Crosby was a
      leader in record sales, radio ratings, and motion picture grosses. His early
      career coincided with technical recording innovations such as the microphone.
      This allowed him to develop a laid-back, intimate singing style that influenced
      many of the popular male singers who followed him, including Perry Como, Frank
      Sinatra, Dick Haymes, and Dean Martin.

      Yes, speaking of Blue Skies, have you seen the 1946 movie staring Bing Crosby?'

      or art of motion-picture photography by recording light or other electromagnetic
      radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically
      by means of a light-sensitive material such as film stock. Typically, a lens
      is used to repeatedly focus the light reflected from objects into real images
      on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a questioned exposure,
      creating multiple images. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an
      electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored
      in a video file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic
      emulsion is a series of invisible latent images on the film stock, which are
      later chemically "developed" into a visible image. The images on the film stock
      are played back at a rapid speed and projected onto a screen, creating the illusion
      of motion. Cinematography finds uses in many fields of science and business
      as well as for entertainment purposes and mass communication. The word "cinematography"
      was created from the Greek words ("kinema"), meaning "movement, motion" and
      ("graphein") meaning "to record", together meaning "recording motion."
