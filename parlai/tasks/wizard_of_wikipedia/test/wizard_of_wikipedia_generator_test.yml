      already had a solid theory behind it, based in human perception of colors.

      RGB color model __knowledge__ RGB is a "device-dependent" color model: different
      devices detect or reproduce a given RGB value differently, since the color elements
      (such as phosphors or dyes) and their response to the individual R, G, and B
      levels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, or even in the same device over
      time.

      Red __knowledge__ Red is the colour at the end of the visible spectrum of light,

      hematite or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide.

      Shades of green __knowledge__ Varieties of the color green may differ in hue,
      chroma (also called saturation or intensity) or lightness (or value, tone, or
      brightness), or in two or three of these qualities.

      Shades of green __knowledge__ Variations in value are also called tints and
      shades, a tint being a green or other hue mixed with white, a shade being mixed
      with black.

      is a body of practical guidance to color mixing and the visual effects of a
      specific color combination.

      Color theory __knowledge__ There are also definitions (or categories) of colors
      based on the color wheel: primary color, secondary color and tertiary color.

      Color theory __knowledge__ Although color theory principles first appeared in
      the writings of Leone Battista Alberti (c.1435) and the notebooks of Leonardo
      da Vinci (c.1490), a tradition of "colory theory" began in the 18th century,
      initially within a partisan controversy over Isaac Newton''s theory of color
      ("Opticks", 1704) and the nature of primary colors.

      Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate __knowledge__ The concept
      of linguistic relativity concerns the relationship between language and thought,
      specifically whether language influences thought, and, if so, how.

      Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate __knowledge__ This question
      has led to research in multiple disciplines—especially anthropology, cognitive
      science, linguistics, and philosophy.

      Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate __knowledge__ Among the most
      popular and controversial theories in this area of scholarly work is the theory
      of linguistic relativity (also known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis).

      Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate __knowledge__ An often-cited
      "strong version" of the claim, first given by Lenneberg in 1953, proposes that
      language structure determines how we perceive the world.

      Tertiary color __knowledge__ A "tertiary color" is a color made by mixing full
      saturation of one primary color with half saturation of another primary color
      and none of a third primary color, in a given color space such as RGB, CMYK
      (more modern) or RYB (traditional).

      Tertiary color __knowledge__ Tertiary colors have general names, one set of
      names for the RGB color wheel and a different set for the RYB color wheel.

      Tertiary color __knowledge__ These names are shown below.

      Tertiary color __knowledge__ Another definition of tertiary color is provided
      by color theorists such as Moses Harrisand Josef Albers, who suggest that tertiary
      colors are created by intermixing pairs of secondary colors: orange-green, green-purple,
      purple-orange; or by intermixing complementary colors.
