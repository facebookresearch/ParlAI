      fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science
      and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel
      universes, and extraterrestrial life.

      Historically, science-fiction stories have had a grounding in actual science,

      to define, as it includes a wide range of subgenres and themes. Hugo Gernsback,
      who suggested the term "scientifiction" for his "Amazing Stories" magazine,
      wrote: "By ''scientifiction'' I mean the Jules Verne, H. G. Wells and Edgar
      Allan Poe type of story—a charming romance intermingled with scientific fact
      and prophetic vision... Not only do these amazing tales make tremendously interesting
      reading—they are always instructive. They supply knowledge... in a very palatable

    - Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues,
      and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition.
    text: 'Science fiction film (or sci-fi film) is a genre that uses speculative,
      fictional science-based depictions of phenomena that are not fully accepted
      by mainstream science, such as extraterrestrial lifeforms, alien worlds, extrasensory
      perception and time travel, along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft,
      robots, cyborgs, interstellar travel or other technologies. Science fiction
      films have often been used to focus on political or social issues, and to explore
      philosophical issues like the human condition. In many cases, tropes derived
      from written science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best
      indifferent to the standards of scientific plausibility and plot logic to which
      written science fiction is traditionally held.

      I think science fiction is an amazing genre for anything. Future science, technology,
      time travel, FTL travel, they''re all such interesting concepts.'

    - The central premise for these stories oftentimes involves changing history,
      either intentionally or by accident, and the ways by which altering the past
      changes the future and creates an altered present or future for the time traveler
      when they return home.
    text: 'Time travel is a common theme in fiction and has been depicted in a variety
      of media, such as literature, television, film, and advertisements. The concept
      of time travel by mechanical means was popularized in H. G. Wells'' 1895 story,
      "The Time Machine". In general, time travel stories focus on the consequences
      of traveling into the past or the future. The central premise for these stories
      oftentimes involves changing history, either intentionally or by accident, and
      the ways by which altering the past changes the future and creates an altered
      present or future for the time traveler when they return home.

      I agree. One of my favorite forms of science fiction is anything related to
      time travel! I find it fascinating.'

    - Internet access was once rare, but has grown rapidly.
    text: 'Internet access is the ability of individuals and organizations to connect
      to the Internet using computer terminals, computers, and other devices; and
      to access services such as email and the World Wide Web. Various technologies,
      at a wide range of speeds have been used by Internet service providers (ISPs)
      to provide this service. Internet access was once rare, but has grown rapidly.
      In 1995, only percent of the world''s population had access, with well over
      half of those living in the United States, and consumer use was through dial-up.
      By the first decade of the 21st century, many consumers in developed nations
      used faster broadband technology, and by 2014, 41 percent of the world''s population
      had access, broadband was almost ubiquitous worldwide, and global average connection
      speeds exceeded 1 Mbit/s. The Internet developed from the ARPANET, which was
      funded by the US government to support projects within the government and at
      universities and research laboratories in the US – but grew over time to include
      most of the world''s large universities and the research arms of many technology
      companies. Use by a wider audience only came in 1995 when restrictions on the
      use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic were lifted.
