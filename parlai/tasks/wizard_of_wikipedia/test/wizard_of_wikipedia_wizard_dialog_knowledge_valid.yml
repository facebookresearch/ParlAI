      different nations; such influx developed a rich diversity in food preparation
      throughout the country.

      Vegetable In everyday usage, vegetables are certain parts of plants that are
      consumed by humans as food as part of a savory meal.

      Vegetable Originally, the traditional term (still commonly used in biology)
      included the flowers, fruit, stems, leaves, roots, tubers, bark, seeds, and
      all other plant matter, although modern-day culinary usage of the term "vegetable"
      may exclude food derived from plants such as fruits, nuts, and cereal grains,
      but include seeds such as pulses; the term "vegetable" is somewhat arbitrary,
      and can be largely defined through culinary and cultural tradition.

      Vegetable Originally, vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gatherers
      and entered cultivation in several parts of the world, probably during the period
      10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agricultural way of life developed.

      and "draw[ing] heavily on herbs, chile peppers and lime," while street food
      of Thailand is "fiery" and "pungent with shrimp paste... and fish sauce" with

    knowledge: 'Gardening Gardening is the practice of growing and cultivating plants
      as part of horticulture.

      Gardening In gardens, ornamental plants are often grown for their flowers, foliage,
      or overall appearance; useful plants, such as root vegetables, leaf vegetables,
      fruits, and herbs, are grown for consumption, for use as dyes, or for medicinal
      or cosmetic use.

      Gardening Gardening is considered by many people to be a relaxing activity.

      Gardening Gardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings
      with one or more different types of shrubs, trees, and herbaceous plants, to
      residential yards including lawns and foundation plantings, to plants in large
      or small containers grown inside or outside.

      Gardening Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown,
      or involve a large number of different plants in mixed plantings.

      Gardening It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and
      tends to be labor-intensive, which differentiates it from farming or forestry.

      Gardening Forest gardening, a forest-based food production system, is the world''s
      oldest form of gardening.

      Gardening Forest gardens originated in prehistoric times along jungle-clad river
      banks and in the wet foothills of monsoon regions.

      Guinea pig The domestic guinea pig or simply guinea pig ("Cavia porcellus"),
      also known as cavy, is a species of rodent belonging to the family Caviidae
      and the genus "Cavia".

      Guinea pig Despite their common name, these animals are not in the pig family
      Suidae, nor do they come from Guinea in Africa.

      Guinea pig They originated in the Andes of South America; studies based on biochemistry
      and hybridization suggest they are domestic descendants of a closely related
      species of cavy such as "C. tschudii", and therefore do not exist naturally
      in the wild.

      Guinea pig The domestic guinea pig plays an important role in the folk culture
      of many indigenous South American groups, especially as a food source, but also
      in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies.

      farm animals in order to maximize production output, while minimizing production
      costs.

      Intensive animal farming Intensive farming refers to animal husbandry, the keeping
      of livestock such as cattle, poultry, and fish at higher stocking densities
      than is usually the case with other forms of animal agriculture—a practice typical
      in industrial farming by agribusinesses.

      Intensive animal farming The main products of this industry are meat, milk and
      eggs for human consumption.

      Intensive animal farming There are issues regarding whether factory farming
      is sustainable or ethical.

      Animal husbandry Animal husbandry is the branch of agriculture concerned with
      animals that are raised for meat, fibre, milk, eggs, or other products.

      Animal husbandry It includes day-to-day care, selective breeding and the raising
      of livestock.

      Animal husbandry Husbandry has a long history, starting with the Neolithic revolution
      when animals were first domesticated, from around 13,000 BC onwards, antedating
      farming of the first crops.

      Animal husbandry By the time of early civilisations such as ancient Egypt, cattle,
      sheep, goats and pigs were being raised on farms.

      Animal husbandry Major changes took place in the Columbian Exchange when Old
      World livestock were brought to the New World, and then in the British Agricultural
      Revolution of the 18th century, when livestock breeds like the Dishley Longhorn
      cattle and Lincoln Longwool sheep were rapidly improved by agriculturalists
      such as Robert Bakewell to yield more meat, milk, and wool.

      5 mm, about the size of a grain of rice.

      Mountain pine beetle In western North America, the current outbreak of the mountain
      pine beetle and its microbial associates has destroyed wide areas of lodgepole
      pine forest, including more than 16 million of the 55 million hectares of forest
      in British Columbia.

      originates from is the Mediterranean Basin, including Northern Tunisia, Algeria,
      and Morocco.

      Pinus pinaster "P. pinaster" is a popular topic in ecology because of its problematic
      growth and spread in South Africa for the past 150 years after being imported
      into the region at the end of the 17th century (1685-1693).
