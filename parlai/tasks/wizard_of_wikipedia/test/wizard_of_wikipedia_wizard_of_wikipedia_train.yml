    - Hyperspace (science fiction):
      - Hyperspace is a faster-than-light (FTL) method of traveling used in science
        fiction.
      - It is typically described as an alternative "sub-region" of space co-existing
        with our own universe which may be entered using an energy field or other
        device.
      - As seen in most fiction hyperspace is most succinctly described as a "somewhere
        else" within which the laws of general and special relativity decidedly do
        "not" apply – especially with respect to the speed of light being the cosmic
        speed limit.
      - Entering and exiting said "elsewhere" thus directly enables travel near or
        faster than the speed of light – almost universally with the aid of extremely
        advanced technology.
    - Science fiction:
      - Science fiction (often shortened to SF or sci-fi) is a genre of speculative
        fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science
        and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel
        universes, and extraterrestrial life.
      - Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and

      - It usually avoids the supernatural, unlike the related genre of fantasy.
      - Historically, science-fiction stories have had a grounding in actual science,
        but now this is only expected of hard science fiction.
    - History of science fiction:
      - The literary genre of science fiction is diverse, and its exact definition
        remains a contested question among both scholars and devotees.
      - This lack of consensus is reflected in debates about the genre's history,
        particularly over determining its exact origins.
      - There are two broad camps of thought, one that identifies the genre's roots
        in early fantastical works such as the Sumerian "Epic of Gilgamesh" (earliest
        Sumerian text versions c. 2150–2000 BCE).
      - A second approach argues that science fiction only became possible sometime
        between the 17th and early 19th centuries, following the scientific revolution
        and major discoveries in astronomy, physics, and mathematics.
    - Science fiction film:
      - Science fiction film (or sci-fi film) is a genre that uses speculative, fictional
        science-based depictions of phenomena that are not fully accepted by mainstream
        science, such as extraterrestrial lifeforms, alien worlds, extrasensory perception
        and time travel, along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft, robots,
        cyborgs, interstellar travel or other technologies.
      - Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social
        issues, and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition.
      - In many cases, tropes derived from written science fiction may be used by
        filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific
        plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally
        held.
    - Time travel:
      - Time travel is the concept of movement between certain points in time, analogous
        to movement between different points in space by an object or a person, typically
        using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle
        or of a portal connecting distant points in spacetime, either to an earlier
        time or to a later time, without the need for the time-traveling body to experience
        the intervening period in the usual sense.
      - Time travel is a widely-recognized concept in philosophy and fiction.
      - It was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel "The Time Machine", which moved
        the concept of time travel into the public imagination.
    - List of starships in Stargate:
      - This is a list of fictional starships in the "Stargate" universe depicted
        through a series of television shows and three feature-length movies.
      - The Ancients are one of the most technologically advanced races in "Stargate",
        and this is reflected in their starships.
      - Duplicates of these ships are utilized by their nanite creations, the Asurans,
        as they also possess knowledge of Ancient technology.
      - The Puddle Jumper or Jumper is a small spacecraft used extensively in the
        "Stargate Atlantis" series.
      - Puddle Jumpers were created by the Ancients and most exist within the city
        built by the Ancients known as Atlantis.
    - History of US science fiction and fantasy magazines to 1950:
      - Science fiction and fantasy magazines began to be published in the US in the
        1920s.
      - Stories with science fiction themes had been appearing for decades in pulp
        magazines such as "Argosy", but there were no magazines that specialized in
        a single genre until 1915, when Street & Smith, one of the major pulp publishers,
        brought out "Detective Story Magazine".
      - The first magazine to focus solely on fantasy and horror was "Weird Tales",
        which was launched in 1923, and established itself as the leading weird fiction
        magazine over the next two decades; writers such as H.P.
      - Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith and Robert E. Howard became regular contributors.

        Sumerian text versions c. 2150–2000 BCE).
      - A second approach argues that science fiction only became possible sometime
        between the 17th and early 19th centuries, following the scientific revolution
        and major discoveries in astronomy, physics, and mathematics.
    - Time travel:
      - Time travel is the concept of movement between certain points in time, analogous
        to movement between different points in space by an object or a person, typically
        using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle
        or of a portal connecting distant points in spacetime, either to an earlier
        time or to a later time, without the need for the time-traveling body to experience
        the intervening period in the usual sense.
      - Time travel is a widely-recognized concept in philosophy and fiction.
      - It was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel "The Time Machine", which moved
        the concept of time travel into the public imagination.
    - Parallel universes in fiction:
      - A parallel universe is a hypothetical self-contained reality co-existing with
        one's own.
      - A specific group of parallel universes are called a "multiverse", although
        this term can also be used to describe the possible parallel universes that
        constitute reality.
      - While the terms "parallel universe" and "alternative reality" are generally
        synonymous and can be used interchangeably in most cases, there is sometimes
        an additional connotation implied with the term "alternative reality" that
        implies that the reality is a variant of our own.
      - The term "parallel universe" is more general, without any connotations implying
        a relationship, or lack of relationship, with our own universe.
    - Alternate history:
      - Alternate history or alternative history (Commonwealth English), sometimes
        abbreviated as AH, is a genre of fiction consisting of stories in which one
        or more historical events occur differently.
      - These stories usually contain "what if" scenarios at crucial points in history
        and present outcomes other than those in the historical record.
      - The stories are conjectural, but are sometimes based on fact.
      - Alternate history has been seen as a subgenre of literary fiction, science
        fiction, or historical fiction; alternate history works may use tropes from
        any or all of these genres.
      - Another term occasionally used for the genre is "allohistory" (literally "other
        history").
    - Time travel in fiction:
      - Time travel is a common theme in fiction and has been depicted in a variety
        of media, such as literature, television, film, and advertisements.
      - The concept of time travel by mechanical means was popularized in H. G. Wells'
        1895 story, "The Time Machine".
      - In general, time travel stories focus on the consequences of traveling into
        the past or the future.
      - The central premise for these stories oftentimes involves changing history,
        either intentionally or by accident, and the ways by which altering the past
        changes the future and creates an altered present or future for the time traveler
        when they return home.

    - Science fiction (often shortened to SF or sci-fi) is a genre of speculative
      fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science
      and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel
      universes, and extraterrestrial life.
    - Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and
      other innovations, and has been called a "literature of ideas".
    - It usually avoids the supernatural, unlike the related genre of fantasy.
    - Historically, science-fiction stories have had a grounding in actual science,
      but now this is only expected of hard science fiction.
    - Science fiction is difficult to define, as it includes a wide range of subgenres
      and themes.
    - 'Hugo Gernsback, who suggested the term "scientifiction" for his "Amazing Stories"
      magazine, wrote: "By ''scientifiction'' I mean the Jules Verne, H. G. Wells
      and Edgar Allan Poe type of story—a charming romance intermingled with scientific
      fact and prophetic vision... Not only do these amazing tales make tremendously
      interesting reading—they are always instructive.'
    - They supply knowledge... in a very palatable form... New adventures pictured
      for us in the scientifiction of today are not at all impossible of realization
      tomorrow...
