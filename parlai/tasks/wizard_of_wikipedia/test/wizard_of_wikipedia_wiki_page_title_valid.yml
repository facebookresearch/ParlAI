      I live on a farm, we garden all year long, it is very relaxing.

      That sounds great.  I''ve always thought that I would love living in a farm,
      but I;ve always lived in the city.  What do you mostly plant?'

      I have planted several fruits trees, tomatoes, jalepenos, bell peppers, onions,
      Garlic, and potatoes mostly.

      Great, I love the idea of growing my own vegetables and fruits! Do you have
      animals in the farm?'
