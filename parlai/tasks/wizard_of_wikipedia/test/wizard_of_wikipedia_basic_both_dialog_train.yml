    - I agree. One of my favorite forms of science fiction is anything related to
      time travel! I find it fascinating.
    text: Awesome! I really love how sci-fi storytellers focus on political/social/philosophical
      issues that would still be around even in the future. Makes them relatable.

    - And that's difficult to do when dealing with time travel. I actually haven't
      seen the latest Harry Potter movies. Guess it's time to check them out!
    text: It's not quite sci-fi, but my favorite version of time travel is in Harry
      Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Breaks zero logical rules.

    - Thank you for the suggestion, I will definitely check it out!
    text: If you really want a look at the potential negative consequences of scientific
      innovation, what you should check out is the TV show Fringe. Incredibly well
      written.

    text: It blends science fiction and paranormal/psychological/MK Ultra type stuff
      together, but it's science fiction at its core.
