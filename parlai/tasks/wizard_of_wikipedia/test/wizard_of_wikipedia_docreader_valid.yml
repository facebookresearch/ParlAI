    text: 'Gardening is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part of
      horticulture. In gardens, ornamental plants are often grown for their flowers,
      foliage, or overall appearance; useful plants, such as root vegetables, leaf
      vegetables, fruits, and herbs, are grown for consumption, for use as dyes, or
      for medicinal or cosmetic use. Gardening is considered by many people to be
      a relaxing activity. Gardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long
      boulevard plantings with one or more different types of shrubs, trees, and herbaceous
      plants, to residential yards including lawns and foundation plantings, to plants
      in large or small containers grown inside or outside. Gardening may be very
      specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve a large number of
      different plants in mixed plantings. It involves an active participation in
      the growing of plants, and tends to be labor-intensive, which differentiates
      it from farming or forestry. Forest gardening, a forest-based food production
      system, is the world''s oldest form of gardening. Forest gardens originated
      in prehistoric times along jungle-clad river banks and in the wet foothills
      of monsoon regions. In the gradual process of families improving their immediate
      environment, useful tree and vine species were identified, protected and improved
      while undesirable species were eliminated.

    text: 'Robert Norman Ross (October 29, 1942 – July 4, 1995) was an American painter,
      art instructor, and television host. He was the creator and host of "The Joy
      of Painting", an instructional television program that aired from 1983 to 1994
      on PBS in the United States, and also aired in Canada, Latin America, and Europe.
      Ross went from being a public-television personality in the 1980s and 1990s
      to being an Internet celebrity in the 21st century, popular with fans on YouTube
      and many other websites. Ross was born in Daytona Beach, Florida, to Jack and
      Ollie Ross (a carpenter and waitress, respectively), and raised in Orlando,
      Florida. As a child, Ross entertained himself by caring for injured animals,
      purportedly including an armadillo, snake, and alligator. One of these animals,
      a squirrel named Peapod, was featured in a few episodes of his show. He had
      a half-brother, Jim, whom he mentioned in passing on his show. Ross dropped
      out of high school in the 9th grade to work as a carpenter with his father,
      Jack Ross, where he lost part of his left index finger. This, however, did not
      affect the way he held his palette while painting. In 1961, then 18-year-old
      Ross enlisted in the United States Air Force and was put into service as a medical
      records technician.
