    - Blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments in painting and traditional
      colour theory, as well as in the RGB colour model.
    - It lies between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light.
    - The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between
      approximately 450 and 495 nanometres.
    - Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colors; azure contains some green,
      while ultramarine contains some violet.
    - The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect
      known as Rayleigh scattering.
    - An optical effect called Tyndall scattering explains blue eyes.
    - Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called atmospheric
      perspective.
    - Blue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times.
    - The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery
      and ornament and later, in The Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine,
      the most expensive of all pigments.
    - In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue and
      white porcelain.

    - RGB color model:
      - The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green and blue
        light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors.
      - The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary
        colors, red, green, and blue.
      - The main purpose of the RGB color model is for the sensing, representation
        and display of images in electronic systems, such as televisions and computers,
        though it has also been used in conventional photography.
      - Before the electronic age, the RGB color model already had a solid theory
        behind it, based in human perception of colors.
      - 'RGB is a "device-dependent" color model: different devices detect or reproduce
        a given RGB value differently, since the color elements (such as phosphors
        or dyes) and their response to the individual R, G, and B levels vary from
        manufacturer to manufacturer, or even in the same device over time.'
    - Red:
      - Red is the colour at the end of the visible spectrum of light, next to orange
        and opposite violet.
      - It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625–740 nanometres.
      - It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the CMYK color model, and
        is the complementary color of cyan.
      - Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red
        crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy.
      - The red sky at sunset results from Rayleigh scattering, while the red color
        of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or
        red ochre, both forms of iron oxide.
    - Shades of green:
      - Varieties of the color green may differ in hue, chroma (also called saturation
        or intensity) or lightness (or value, tone, or brightness), or in two or three
        of these qualities.
      - Variations in value are also called tints and shades, a tint being a green
        or other hue mixed with white, a shade being mixed with black.
      - A large selection of these various colors is shown below.
      - Green is common in nature, especially in plants.
      - Many plants are green mainly because of a complex chemical known as chlorophyll
        which is involved in photosynthesis.
      - Many shades of green have been named after plants or are related to plants.
    - Chicago White Sox:
      - The Chicago White Sox are an American professional baseball team based in
        Chicago.
      - The White Sox compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the
        American League (AL) Central division.
      - Home games are held at Guaranteed Rate Field, located on the city's South
        Side, and the team is owned by Jerry Reinsdorf.
      - They are one of two major league clubs in Chicago; the other is the Chicago
        Cubs, who are a member of the National League (NL) Central division.
      - One of the American League's eight charter franchises, the franchise was established
        as a major league baseball club in .
      - The club was originally called the Chicago White Stockings, but this was soon
        shortened to Chicago White Sox.
    - Color theory:
      - In the visual arts, color theory or colour theory is a body of practical guidance
        to color mixing and the visual effects of a specific color combination.
      - 'There are also definitions (or categories) of colors based on the color wheel:
        primary color, secondary color and tertiary color.'
      - Although color theory principles first appeared in the writings of Leone Battista
        Alberti (c.1435) and the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci (c.1490), a tradition
        of "colory theory" began in the 18th century, initially within a partisan
        controversy over Isaac Newton's theory of color ("Opticks", 1704) and the
        nature of primary colors.
    - Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate:
      - The concept of linguistic relativity concerns the relationship between language
        and thought, specifically whether language influences thought, and, if so,
        how.
      - This question has led to research in multiple disciplines—especially anthropology,
        cognitive science, linguistics, and philosophy.
      - Among the most popular and controversial theories in this area of scholarly
        work is the theory of linguistic relativity (also known as the Sapir–Whorf
        hypothesis).
      - An often-cited "strong version" of the claim, first given by Lenneberg in
        1953, proposes that language structure determines how we perceive the world.
    - Tertiary color:
      - A "tertiary color" is a color made by mixing full saturation of one primary
        color with half saturation of another primary color and none of a third primary
        color, in a given color space such as RGB, CMYK (more modern) or RYB (traditional).
      - Tertiary colors have general names, one set of names for the RGB color wheel
        and a different set for the RYB color wheel.
      - These names are shown below.
      - 'Another definition of tertiary color is provided by color theorists such
        as Moses Harrisand Josef Albers, who suggest that tertiary colors are created
        by intermixing pairs of secondary colors: orange-green, green-purple, purple-orange;
        or by intermixing complementary colors.'

        against John Malm.

      - He also was an owner of the Music Box Theatre on Broadway.
      - '"Alexander''s Ragtime Band" sparked an international dance craze in places

        marked a departure from their signature sound and an opportunity for him to
        collaborate with other musicians and explore new ideas.

    - Blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments in painting and traditional
      colour theory, as well as in the RGB colour model.
    - It lies between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light.
    - The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between
      approximately 450 and 495 nanometres.
    - Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colors; azure contains some green,
      while ultramarine contains some violet.
    - The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect
      known as Rayleigh scattering.
    - An optical effect called Tyndall scattering explains blue eyes.
    - Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called atmospheric
      perspective.
    - Blue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times.
    - The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery
      and ornament and later, in The Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine,
      the most expensive of all pigments.
    - In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue and
      white porcelain.
    - In the Middle Ages, European artists used it in the windows of Cathedrals.
    - Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was replaced
      by the finer indigo from America.
