    - Gardening is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part of horticulture.
    - In gardens, ornamental plants are often grown for their flowers, foliage, or

      fruits, and herbs, are grown for consumption, for use as dyes, or for medicinal
      or cosmetic use.
    - Gardening is considered by many people to be a relaxing activity.
    - Gardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings with
      one or more different types of shrubs, trees, and herbaceous plants, to residential
      yards including lawns and foundation plantings, to plants in large or small
      containers grown inside or outside.
    - Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve
      a large number of different plants in mixed plantings.
    - It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to be
      labor-intensive, which differentiates it from farming or forestry.
    - Forest gardening, a forest-based food production system, is the world's oldest
      form of gardening.
    - Forest gardens originated in prehistoric times along jungle-clad river banks
      and in the wet foothills of monsoon regions.
    - In the gradual process of families improving their immediate environment, useful
      tree and vine species were identified, protected and improved while undesirable
      species were eliminated.

        north and the south of the Italian peninsula.
      - It offers an abundance of taste, and is one of the most popular and copied
        in the world.
      - It influenced several cuisines around the world chiefly that of the United
        States.
    - Pickling:
      - Pickling is the process of preserving or expanding the lifespan of food by
        either anaerobic fermentation in brine or immersion in vinegar.
      - The resulting food is called a "pickle", or, to prevent ambiguity, prefaced
        with the adjective "pickled".
      - The pickling procedure will typically affect the food's texture and flavor.
      - In East Asia, vinaigrette (vegetable oil and vinegar) is also used as a pickling
        medium.
      - Foods that are pickled include meats, fruits, eggs, and vegetables.
      - Another distinguishing characteristic is a pH of 4.6 or lower, which is sufficient
        to kill most bacteria.
      - Pickling can preserve perishable foods for months.
    - Cuisine of the United States:
      - The cuisine of the United States reflects its history.
      - The European colonization of the Americas yielded the introduction of a number
        of ingredients and cooking styles to the latter.
      - The various styles continued expanding well into the 19th and 20th centuries,
        proportional to the influx of immigrants from many different nations; such
        influx developed a rich diversity in food preparation throughout the country.
      - Early Native Americans utilized a number of cooking methods in early American
        Cuisine that have been blended with early European cooking methods to form
        the basis of American Cuisine.
      - When the colonists came to the colonies, they farmed animals for clothing
        and meat in a similar fashion to what they had done in Europe.
    - Sofrito:
      - Sofrito (), or soffritto (Italian), or refogado (, ), is a sauce used as a
        base in Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Latin American cooking.
      - Preparations may vary, but it typically consists of aromatic ingredients cut
        into small pieces and sauteed or braised in cooking oil.
      - In Spanish cuisine, sofrito consists of garlic, onion, paprika, and tomatoes
        cooked in olive oil.
      - This is known as or sometimes as in Portuguese-speaking nations, where only
        onions and olive oil are often essential, garlic and bay laurel leaves being
        the other most common ingredients.
      - In Brazilian cuisine, the verb encompasses also dishes that are fried in vegetable
        oil before being boiled or steamed, even when the actual fried seasoning is
        not there.
    - Regional street food:
      - Street foods, ready-to-eat food or drink sold in a street or other public
        place, such as a market or fair, by a hawker or vendor, often from a portable
        stall, have variations within both regions and cultures.
      - For example, Dorling Kindersley describes the street food of Viet Nam as being
        "fresh and lighter than many of the cuisines in the area" and "draw[ing] heavily
        on herbs, chile peppers and lime," while street food of Thailand is "fiery"
        and "pungent with shrimp paste... and fish sauce" with New York City's signature
        street food being the hot dog, although the offerings in New York also range
        from "spicy Middle Eastern falafel or Jamaican jerk chicken to Belgian waffles."
    - Filipino cuisine:
      - 'Filipino cuisine (Filipino: "Lutuing Filipino" or "Pagkaing Filipino") is
        composed of the cuisines of 135 distinct ethno-linguistic tribes found within
        the Philippine archipelago, however, majority of mainstream Filipino dishes
        that compose Filipino cuisine are from the cuisines of the Bikol, Chabakano,
        Hiligaynon, Ilokano, Kapampangan, Meranaw, Pangasinan, Sebwano (or Bisaya),
        Tagalog, and Waray ethno-linguistic tribes.'
      - The style of cooking and the food associated with it have evolved over many
        centuries from their Austronesian origins (shared with Malaysian and Indonesian
        cuisines) to a mixed cuisine of Indian, Chinese, Spanish, and American influences,
        in line with the major waves of influence that had enriched the cultures of
        the archipelago, as well as others adapted to indigenous ingredients and the
        local palate.

    chosen_topic_passage:
    - Gardening is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part of horticulture.
    - In gardens, ornamental plants are often grown for their flowers, foliage, or
      overall appearance; useful plants, such as root vegetables, leaf vegetables,
      fruits, and herbs, are grown for consumption, for use as dyes, or for medicinal
      or cosmetic use.
    - Gardening is considered by many people to be a relaxing activity.
    - Gardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings with
      one or more different types of shrubs, trees, and herbaceous plants, to residential
      yards including lawns and foundation plantings, to plants in large or small
      containers grown inside or outside.
    - Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve
      a large number of different plants in mixed plantings.
    - It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to be
      labor-intensive, which differentiates it from farming or forestry.
    - Forest gardening, a forest-based food production system, is the world's oldest
      form of gardening.
    - Forest gardens originated in prehistoric times along jungle-clad river banks
      and in the wet foothills of monsoon regions.
    - In the gradual process of families improving their immediate environment, useful
      tree and vine species were identified, protected and improved while undesirable
      species were eliminated.

    - Urban agriculture:
      - Urban agriculture, urban farming, or urban gardening is the practice of cultivating,
        processing, and distributing food in or around a village, town, or city.
      - Urban agriculture can also involve animal husbandry, aquaculture, agroforestry,
        urban beekeeping, and horticulture.
      - These activities occur in peri-urban areas as well, and peri-urban agriculture
        may have different characteristics.
      - Urban agriculture can reflect varying levels of economic and social development.
      - In the global north, it often takes the form of a social movement for sustainable
        communities, where organic growers, ‘foodies,’ and ‘locavores’ form social
        networks founded on a shared ethos of nature and community holism.

        and meat in a similar fashion to what they had done in Europe.
    - History of agriculture in the People's Republic of China:
      - In 4,000 years, China has been a nation of farmers.
      - By the time the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, virtually
        all arable land was under cultivation; irrigation and drainage systems constructed
        centuries earlier and intensive farming practices already produced relatively
        high yields.
      - But little prime virgin land was available to support population growth and
        economic development.
      - However, after a decline in production as a result of the Great Leap Forward
        (1958–60), agricultural reforms implemented in the 1980s increased yields
        and promised even greater future production from existing cultivated land.
    - Ancient Israelite cuisine:
      - Ancient Israelite cuisine refers to the food eaten by the ancient Israelites
        during a period of over a thousand years, from the beginning of the Israelite
        presence in the Land of Israel at the beginning of the Iron Age until the
        Roman period.
      - The dietary staples were bread, wine and olive oil, but also included legumes,
        fruits and vegetables, dairy products, fish and meat.
      - Religious beliefs, which prohibited the consumption of certain foods, shaped
        the Israelite diet.
      - There was considerable continuity in the main components of the diet over
        time, despite the introduction of new foodstuffs at various stages.
    - Agriculture in India:
      - The history of Agriculture in India dates back to Indus Valley Civilization
        Era and even before that in some parts of Southern India.
      - Today, India ranks second worldwide in farm output.
      - Agriculture and allied sectors like forestry and fisheries accounted for 13.7%
        of the GDP (gross domestic product) in 2013, about 50% of the workforce.
      - The economic contribution of agriculture to India's GDP is steadily declining
        with the country's broad-based economic growth.
      - Still, agriculture is demographically the broadest economic sector and plays
        a significant role in the overall socio-economic fabric of India.
    - Vegetable:
      - In everyday usage, vegetables are certain parts of plants that are consumed
        by humans as food as part of a savory meal.
      - Originally, the traditional term (still commonly used in biology) included
        the flowers, fruit, stems, leaves, roots, tubers, bark, seeds, and all other
        plant matter, although modern-day culinary usage of the term "vegetable" may
        exclude food derived from plants such as fruits, nuts, and cereal grains,
        but include seeds such as pulses; the term "vegetable" is somewhat arbitrary,
        and can be largely defined through culinary and cultural tradition.
      - Originally, vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gatherers and
        entered cultivation in several parts of the world, probably during the period
        10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agricultural way of life developed.
    - Indian cuisine:
      - Indian cuisine comprises a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines
        native to the Indian subcontinent.
      - Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic groups,
        and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially from each other and use
        locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.
      - Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hindu, and
        cultural choices and traditions.
      - Also, Middle Eastern and Central Asian influences have occurred on North Indian
        cuisine from the years of Mughal rule.
      - Indian cuisine is still evolving, as a result of the nation's cultural interactions
        with other societies.
