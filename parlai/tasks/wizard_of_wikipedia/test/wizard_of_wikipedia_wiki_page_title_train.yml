      It's not quite sci-fi, but my favorite version of time travel is in Harry Potter\
      \ and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Breaks zero logical rules.\nAnd that's difficult\
      \ to do when dealing with time travel. I actually haven't seen the latest Harry\
      \ Potter movies. Guess it's time to check them out!"
