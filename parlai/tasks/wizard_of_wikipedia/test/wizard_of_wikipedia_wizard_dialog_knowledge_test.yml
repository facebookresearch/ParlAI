      RGB color model The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red,
      green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad
      array of colors.

      RGB color model The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive
      primary colors, red, green, and blue.

      RGB color model The main purpose of the RGB color model is for the sensing,
      representation and display of images in electronic systems, such as televisions
      and computers, though it has also been used in conventional photography.

      RGB color model Before the electronic age, the RGB color model already had a
      solid theory behind it, based in human perception of colors.

      RGB color model RGB is a "device-dependent" color model: different devices detect
      or reproduce a given RGB value differently, since the color elements (such as
      phosphors or dyes) and their response to the individual R, G, and B levels vary
      from manufacturer to manufacturer, or even in the same device over time.

      Red Red is the colour at the end of the visible spectrum of light, next to orange
      and opposite violet.

      Red It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625–740 nanometres.

      Red It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the CMYK color model, and
      is the complementary color of cyan.

      Red Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red
      crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy.

      Red The red sky at sunset results from Rayleigh scattering, while the red color
      of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red
      ochre, both forms of iron oxide.

      Shades of green Varieties of the color green may differ in hue, chroma (also
      called saturation or intensity) or lightness (or value, tone, or brightness),
      or in two or three of these qualities.

      Shades of green Variations in value are also called tints and shades, a tint
      being a green or other hue mixed with white, a shade being mixed with black.

      Shades of green A large selection of these various colors is shown below.

      Shades of green Green is common in nature, especially in plants.

      Shades of green Many plants are green mainly because of a complex chemical known
      as chlorophyll which is involved in photosynthesis.

      Shades of green Many shades of green have been named after plants or are related
      to plants.

      Color theory In the visual arts, color theory or colour theory is a body of
      practical guidance to color mixing and the visual effects of a specific color
      combination.

      Color theory There are also definitions (or categories) of colors based on the
      color wheel: primary color, secondary color and tertiary color.

      Color theory Although color theory principles first appeared in the writings
      of Leone Battista Alberti (c.1435) and the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci (c.1490),
      a tradition of "colory theory" began in the 18th century, initially within a
      partisan controversy over Isaac Newton''s theory of color ("Opticks", 1704)
      and the nature of primary colors.

      Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate The concept of linguistic
      relativity concerns the relationship between language and thought, specifically
      whether language influences thought, and, if so, how.

      Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate This question has led to research
      in multiple disciplines—especially anthropology, cognitive science, linguistics,
      and philosophy.

      Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate Among the most popular and
      controversial theories in this area of scholarly work is the theory of linguistic
      relativity (also known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis).

      Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate An often-cited "strong version"
      of the claim, first given by Lenneberg in 1953, proposes that language structure
      determines how we perceive the world.

      Tertiary color A "tertiary color" is a color made by mixing full saturation
      of one primary color with half saturation of another primary color and none
      of a third primary color, in a given color space such as RGB, CMYK (more modern)
      or RYB (traditional).

      Tertiary color Tertiary colors have general names, one set of names for the
      RGB color wheel and a different set for the RYB color wheel.

      Tertiary color These names are shown below.

      Tertiary color Another definition of tertiary color is provided by color theorists
      such as Moses Harrisand Josef Albers, who suggest that tertiary colors are created
      by intermixing pairs of secondary colors: orange-green, green-purple, purple-orange;
      or by intermixing complementary colors.

      Irving Berlin Irving Berlin (born Israel Beilin; May 11, 1888 – September 22,
      1989) was an American composer and lyricist, widely considered one of the greatest
      songwriters in American history.

      Irving Berlin His music forms a great part of the Great American Songbook.

      the age of five.

      Irving Berlin He published his first song, "Marie from Sunny Italy", in 1907,
      receiving 33 cents for the publishing rights, and had his first major international
      hit, "Alexander''s Ragtime Band" in 1911.

      Irving Berlin He also was an owner of the Music Box Theatre on Broadway.

      Irving Berlin "Alexander''s Ragtime Band" sparked an international dance craze
      in places as far away as Berlin''s native Russia, which also "flung itself into
      the ragtime beat with an abandon bordering on mania."

      automotive performance with locomotive dominance; to showcase recent progress
      achieved by cars regarding reliability, durability, speed and comfort; to promote
      the cars, their marques and the adventurous persona of their drivers; and to
      establish automobiles as a viable and aspirational mode of transport for the
      individual traveller.

      Video camera tube The video camera tube was a type of cathode ray tube used
      to capture the television image prior to the introduction of charge-coupled
      devices (CCDs) in the 1980s.

      Video camera tube Several different types of tubes were in use from the early
      1930s to the 1980s.

      Video camera tube In these tubes, the cathode ray was scanned across an image
      of the scene to be broadcast.

      Video camera tube The resultant current was dependent on the brightness of the
      image on the target.

      Video camera tube The size of the striking ray was tiny compared to the size
      of the target, allowing 483 horizontal scan lines per image in the NTSC format,
      or 576 lines in PAL.

      a motion picture using digital image sensors rather than through film stock.

      Digital cinematography As digital technology has improved in recent years, this
      practice has become dominant.

      Digital cinematography Since the mid 2010s most of the movies across the world
      are captured as well as distributed digitally.

      Digital cinematography Many vendors have brought products to market, including
      traditional film camera vendors like Arri and Panavision, as well as new vendors
      like RED, Blackmagic, Silicon Imaging, Vision Research and companies which have
      traditionally focused on consumer and broadcast video equipment, like Sony,
      GoPro, and Panasonic.

      Color motion picture film Color motion picture film refers both to unexposed
      color photographic film in a format suitable for use in a motion picture camera,
      and to finished motion picture film, ready for use in a projector, which bears
      images in color.

      Color motion picture film The first color cinematography was by additive color
      systems such as the one patented by Edward Raymond Turner in 1899 and tested
      in 1902.

      Color motion picture film A simplified additive system was successfully commercialized
      in 1909 as Kinemacolor.

      Color motion picture film These early systems used black-and-white film to photograph
      and project two or more component images through different color filters.

      Color motion picture film Around 1920, the first practical subtractive color
      processes were introduced.

      Movie camera The movie camera, film camera or cine-camera is a type of photographic
      camera which takes a rapid sequence of photographs on an image sensor or on
      a film.

      Movie camera In contrast to a still camera, which captures a single snapshot
      at a time, the movie camera takes a series of images; each image constitutes
      a "frame".

      Movie camera This is accomplished through an intermittent mechanism.

      Movie camera The frames are later played back in a movie projector at a specific
      speed, called the frame rate (number of frames per second).

      Movie camera While viewing at a particular frame rate, a person''s eyes and
      brain merge the separate pictures together to create the illusion of motion.

      History of film technology The history of film technology traces the development
      of film technology from the initial development of "moving pictures" at the
      end of 19th century to the present time.

      History of film technology Motion pictures were initially exhibited as a fairground
      novelty and developed into one of the most important tools of communication
      and entertainment in the 20th century.

      History of film technology Major developments in motion picture technology have
      included the adoption of synchronized motion picture sound, color motion picture
      film, and the adoption of digital film technologies to replace physical film
      stock at both ends of the production chain by digital image sensors and projectors.

      35 mm film 35 mm film (millimeter) is the film gauge most commonly used for
      motion pictures and chemical still photography (see 135 film).

      35 mm film The name of the gauge refers to the width of the photographic film,
      which consists of strips 34.98 ±0.03 mm (1.377 ±0.001 inches) wide.

      35 mm film The standard negative pulldown for movies ("single-frame" format)
      is four perforations per frame along both edges, which results in 16 frames
      per foot of film.

      35 mm film For still photography, the standard frame has eight perforations
      on each side.

      35 mm film A variety of largely proprietary gauges were devised for the numerous
      camera and projection systems being developed independently in the late 19th
      century and early 20th century, ranging from 13 mm to 75 mm (0.51–2.95 in),
