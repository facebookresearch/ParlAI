    - I'm not sure there is one, you may need to just tweak ~/.config/xfce4.
    - I don't remember though. anyone else? how to get verbose output during a boot?
      turn of boot splash during live cd?
    - which error is that?. btw don't make us ask these questions

    - 'you need the qt -dev package, search for packages with the following words
      in their name: lib, qt, -dev'
    - Not sure how to do config files, but I know if you open synaptic you can save
      a package configuration and load that onto another system.  Best thing you could
      do is if you have any local config files back them up with your home folder,
      any global ones you will have to do manually
    - if you have your zone files there and bind config as well I think you should
      be fine

    text: 'participant 1: Hi, I want to run a graphical application from the command
      line, here is the script I wrote: https://paste8.com/4XQiHrXZ - it''s Ubuntu
      Server 12.04 + Unity. What I get is an error from xhost "unable to open display
      :0" and from the graphical application I want to use (Sikuli) "Can''t connect
      to X11 window server using '':0'' as the value of the DISPLAY variable.". I''ve
      tried using DISPLAY:=1 as I use this number when connecting with a VNC client
      but it doesn''t wo. rk either...

      participant 2: is X running?

      participant 1: I think so: https://paste8.com/HvhlT6vO.  maybe you prefer this
      check: https://paste8.com/0OhcBmfB

      participant 2: these days you use lightdm (or gdm, kdm) to start X, so i''d
      try to kill what''s there but unreachable with "sudo killall X" and then "sudo
      service lightdm start"

      participant 1: what do I kill precisely? because it says "X: no such process"

      participant 2: nothing, X wasn''t running if you get that, proceed with "sudo
      service lightdm start" and then test your script

      participant 1: alright but "start: Job is already running: lightdm"

      participant 2: worm: try restart

      participant 1: I did but I get "No protocol specified. " followed by "xhost:
      unable to open display :0" when executing my script (i.e. https://paste8.com/4XQiHrXZ).
      does it matter I run everything from a root tty? because that''s what I do

      participant 2: ahh, not a good idea to try to start X as root no.  now your
      regular users ~/.Xauthority file is probably owned by root, check that.  what
      does "ls -la ~/.Xauthority" give you?

      participant 1: yes I got /root/.Xauthority I need to append an entry for my
      regular user right?

      participant 2: check if your regular user still owns his .Xauthority file and
      remove the one for root

      participant 1: there is no .Xauthority for my regular user I''m afraid

      participant 2: well, copy the one from root to the user /home and make him own
      it, use the chown command.  sudo chown $USER:$USER $HOME/.Xauthority

      participant 1: done, but running $sudo service lightdm start; returns "Sorry,
      user <myuser> is not allowed to execute ''/usr/sbin/service lightdm start''
      as root on <myhost>."

      participant 2: is the regular user in the sudoers?

      participant 1: no, I believe I have to create a file in /etc/sudoers.d but I
      don''t know the syntax yet

      after installing i get a gruub error 15, or something like that. First i had
      gruub installed in the default hdd, after that i tried installing it on my root
      partition and it still doesn''t work. I am running from the virtual cd right
      now... how can i get things to work?

      participant 2: would help if you run a ''sudo fdisk -l'' and paste the result
      to http://paste.ubuntu.com/

      participant 1: one moment.  http://pastebin.com/m537d4e8e

      participant 2: k.  see the ''Partition table entries are not in disk order''
      ? that might confuse grub

      participant 1: and what might be the solution to that? i partitioned in gparted

      participant 2: to correct that, run sudo fdisk /dev/sda, then ''x'' (expert
      mode) ''f'' (fix errors), then ''w'' (write corrcted part-table).  the run sudo
      fdisk -l again and paste result again, along with your /boot/grub/menu.lst (the
      one from the installed system)

      participant 1: so that''s "sudo fdisk /dev/sda -x -f -w" ?

      participant 2: yup ... but i''d not run that as comand line switches, but pree
      the keys in the fdisk cli... so you notice if something goes wrong

      participant 1: ok done that, let me get output.  http://pastebin.com/m35f57da2

      participant 2: looks better now... now /boot/grub/menu.lst
