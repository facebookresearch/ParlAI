      worried? :P

    - why do you want to write it to the terminal?.  it will write to stdout, but
      it is refusing to write to the console
    - one sec i am looking it up
    - You mean it just dissapears?
    - you can install it but it may have newer deps and then they mayneed newer deps
      and you'll have some weird frankenstien install
    - im pretty sure i had to do that once. cause apt was complaining about duplicate
      sources. doesnt hurt nothin, just makes first apt-get take longer
    - yeah some of the compiz goodies were nice to play with. but only for show and
      tell. I too didnt use them much. admin_masu3710 just ask. dont ask to ask

    - fsck
    - it's just a submenu in networkmanager
    - No, but you can specify it with apt-get (see the man page, the second paragraph
      for 'install')
    text: 'participant 1: Hi, upgraded from 12.04 to 14.04 on my thinkpad x220. Have
      a couple of issues related to video and im not sure if it relates to having
      x-swat ppa on my previous install. basically when I hot undock my laptop from
      my docking station the graphics glitch out and everything but the mouse cursor
      flickers. only way to resolve is switch to a vterm and kill Xorg.. was wondering
      what troubleshooting steps I can take before I restore my 12.04 system image.

      participant 2: common upgrade practice is to remove all custom PPAs *beforehand*
      so that could be a good start

      participant 1: I had forgotten id enabled it :( since everything worked so well.
      I tried the x-swat repo in trusty but theres no updated packages. I tried the
      xorg-edgers ppa and these drivers have the same issues

      participant 2: my point was to run built-in, not look for yet more PPAs to break
      and confuse things :)

      participant 1: presumably after the update I had built in? that was acting broken

    - precisely what chipset is it?
    - find a SVG version, or PNG one with alpha.

    - pmount currently doesn't support mounting NFS shares

    - try `man dpkg` or `dpkg --force-help [package name]`.  when reading through

      participant 1: basically, i was being careless.  what do I find in there? I
      looked but wasn''t sure what to look for

      it failed to load hw_random. something like that

    - Sounds like compiz is crashing, possibly because of a driver bug. Try to get
      a detailed crash report by installing compiz-dbg and enabling Crash Handler
      plugin in ccsm then look in /tmp for a crash log if it happens again
    - Besides that, 10.10 was able to use FAT32 usb drives.
    - what do you mean nothing changes?
    - yeah, you need to escape the space, with a \. or you can use quotes, like cd
      Documentos/"ficheiros pdf"
    - sounds like you've lost your WM, something like 'metacity --replace' in a terminal
      might work
    - i think 'x-terminal-emulator' is a capability, not a package.  e.g., the 'gnome-terminal'
      package provides 'x-terminal-emulator'
