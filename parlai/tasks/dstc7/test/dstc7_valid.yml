    - you have to select the drivers manually from the list of models and you have
      to select the correct model otherwise it will not work.  did you install the
      deb using sudo dpkg
    - i did that. followed by iwconfig wlan0 commit as well
    - be sure your system is up-to-date, then look in System / Admin / Hardware Drivers
    - change the resolution
    - edit your menu.lst and change the timeout value
    - very little if any.
    - it's a duplicate , change that parameter in the line above.  you got two 'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT'
    - remove them from groups
    - totem crashes on launch :@.  when i started using ubuntu it was nice, it didnt
      have a lot of bugs, these days its starting to get redicoules, im starting to
      feel like im working on a windows box again

    - don't - it will break things

      it doesnt know either. Have set it under wireshark surveilance now. Could this
      possible be an rogue Remote Access daemon?

      participant 2: it might be p2p traffic

    - then, the driver for your touchpad is broken. I don't think that they do know
      which keys they have given to which computer. anyone has a hint for builtin
      webcam which does not work? (lsusb shows it, yet there is no /dev/video)

      Problem is, that your present boot is also log. You will have to search a bit.
