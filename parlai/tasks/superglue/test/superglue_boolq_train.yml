    passage: Persian language -- Persian (/ˈpɜːrʒən, -ʃən/), also known by its endonym
      Farsi (فارسی fārsi (fɒːɾˈsiː) ( listen)), is one of the Western Iranian languages
      within the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. It is primarily
      spoken in Iran, Afghanistan (officially known as Dari since 1958), and Tajikistan
      (officially known as Tajiki since the Soviet era), and some other regions which
      historically were Persianate societies and considered part of Greater Iran.
      It is written in the Persian alphabet, a modified variant of the Arabic script,
      which itself evolved from the Aramaic alphabet.

    passage: 'Good Samaritan law -- Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to
      people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe
      to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is
      intended to reduce bystanders'' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued
      or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such
      a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle
      that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from
      being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being
      reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should
      they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires
      people to offer assistance and holds those who fail to do so liable.'

    passage: Powdered sugar -- Powdered sugar, also called confectioners' sugar, icing
      sugar, and icing cake, is a finely ground sugar produced by milling granulated
      sugar into a powdered state. It usually contains a small amount of anti-caking
      agent to prevent clumping and improve flow. Although most often produced in
      a factory, powdered sugar can also be made by processing ordinary granulated
      sugar in a coffee grinder, or by crushing it by hand in a mortar and pestle.

    passage: 'The Elder Scrolls Online -- As with other games in The Elder Scrolls
      series, the game is set on the continent of Tamriel. The events of the game
      occur a millennium before those of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and around 800
      years before The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.
      It has a broadly similar structure to Skyrim, with two separate conflicts progressing
      at the same time, one with the fate of the world in the balance, and one where
      the prize is supreme power on Tamriel. In The Elder Scrolls Online, the first
      struggle is against the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, who is attempting to meld
      the plane of Mundus with his realm of Coldharbour, and the second is to capture
      the vacant imperial throne, contested by three alliances of the mortal races.
      The player character has been sacrificed to Molag Bal, and Molag Bal has stolen
      their soul, the recovery of which is the primary game objective.'
