    passage: 'Ethanol fuel -- All biomass goes through at least some of these steps:
      it needs to be grown, collected, dried, fermented, distilled, and burned. All
      of these steps require resources and an infrastructure. The total amount of
      energy input into the process compared to the energy released by burning the
      resulting ethanol fuel is known as the energy balance (or ``energy returned
      on energy invested''''). Figures compiled in a 2007 report by National Geographic
      Magazine point to modest results for corn ethanol produced in the US: one unit
      of fossil-fuel energy is required to create 1.3 energy units from the resulting
      ethanol. The energy balance for sugarcane ethanol produced in Brazil is more
      favorable, with one unit of fossil-fuel energy required to create 8 from the
      ethanol. Energy balance estimates are not easily produced, thus numerous such
      reports have been generated that are contradictory. For instance, a separate
      survey reports that production of ethanol from sugarcane, which requires a tropical
      climate to grow productively, returns from 8 to 9 units of energy for each unit
      expended, as compared to corn, which only returns about 1.34 units of fuel energy
      for each unit of energy expended. A 2006 University of California Berkeley study,
      after analyzing six separate studies, concluded that producing ethanol from
      corn uses much less petroleum than producing gasoline.'

    passage: Property tax -- Property tax or 'house tax' is a local tax on buildings,
      along with appurtenant land. It is and imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian
      of property as per 1978, 44th amendment of constitution). It resembles the US-type
      wealth tax and differs from the excise-type UK rate. The tax power is vested
      in the states and is delegated to local bodies, specifying the valuation method,
      rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value
      (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied and other properties not producing
      rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage
      of cost, usually four percent. Vacant land is generally exempt. Central government
      properties are exempt. Instead a 'service charge' is permissible under executive
      order. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring
      reciprocity. The tax is usually accompanied by service taxes, e.g., water tax,
      drainage tax, conservancy (sanitation) tax, lighting tax, all using the same
      tax base. The rate structure is flat on rural (panchayat) properties, but in
      the urban (municipal) areas it is mildly progressive with about 80% of assessments
      falling in the first two brackets.
