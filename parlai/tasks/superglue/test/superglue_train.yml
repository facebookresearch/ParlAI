    passage: Persian language -- Persian (/ˈpɜːrʒən, -ʃən/), also known by its endonym
      Farsi (فارسی fārsi (fɒːɾˈsiː) ( listen)), is one of the Western Iranian languages
      within the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. It is primarily
      spoken in Iran, Afghanistan (officially known as Dari since 1958), and Tajikistan
      (officially known as Tajiki since the Soviet era), and some other regions which
      historically were Persianate societies and considered part of Greater Iran.
      It is written in the Persian alphabet, a modified variant of the Arabic script,
      which itself evolved from the Aramaic alphabet.

    passage: 'Good Samaritan law -- Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to
      people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe
      to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is
      intended to reduce bystanders'' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued
      or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such
      a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle
      that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from
      being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being
      reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should
      they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires
      people to offer assistance and holds those who fail to do so liable.'
