### Turn Annotations MTurk Task

This task allows one to collect model-human conversations with annotations of
customized characteristics via checkboxes on  the model turns.

Modify constants.py with HTML for the task description (shown when the worker
first enters the task) and the left pane (shown on the left during the
conversation).

Customize ONBOARD_TASK_DATA in constants.py to provide your own onboarding
conversation and answers.

Customize the buckets you want to collect per turn in constants.py as well.

Using launch.py, you can customize various aspects including: the models to run,
where to save data, where to find models to run, and others.

Modify worlds.py -> TurnAnnotationsOnboardWorld -> check_onboarding_answers() to
change worker selection criteria.

Warnings: Code is somewhat rough around the edges, and it uses the legacy version of the ParlAI MTurk integration
