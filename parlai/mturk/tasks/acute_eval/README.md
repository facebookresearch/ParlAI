This task has been archived. The current Mephisto-based version of the ACUTE-Eval crowdsourcing task can be found in [`parlai.crowdsourcing.tasks.acute_eval`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/master/parlai/crowdsourcing/tasks/acute_eval), and an all-in-one version of ACUTE-Eval, Fast ACUTE, can be found in [`parlai.crowdsourcing.tasks.fast_acute`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/master/parlai/crowdsourcing/tasks/fast_acute).

However, if you do want to access the obsolete pre-Mephisto version of this task, you can restore it by switching to the `acute_eval` tag of ParlAI:

```bash
$ git checkout acute_eval
```
