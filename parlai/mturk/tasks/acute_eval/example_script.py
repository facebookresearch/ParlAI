"""
Example script for running ACUTE-EVAL.
The only arguments that *must* be modified for this to be run are:
'dialogs_path':  Path to folder containing logs of all model conversations.
    Each model should have one file named '<modelname>.jsonl'
'model_comparisons': List of tuples indicating pairs of models to be compared.
    The model names here should match the names of files in the folder
'onboarding_tasks': List of tuples in format (id1, id2, name of matchup) where
    id1, id2 are conversation ids where id2 is the correct conversation's id
Help strings for the other arguments can be found in run.py
