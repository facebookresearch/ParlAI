<h2><b>Description</b></h2>
In this task, you will be shown 5 images, and will write an engaging comment
about each image. The goal of this task is to write something about an image
that someone else would find engaging.
<br>
<br>
<h4><b>STEP 1</b></h4> You will be shown an image, for which you will write
an engaging comment. Please make sure your comment has at least
<b>three words</b>. Note that these are
<em>comments</em>, not captions.
<br>
<br>
E.g., if you are shown an image of a tree, you could write, "I'd love
to climb that tree!"
<br>
<br>
<h4><b>REWARD/BONUS</b></h4>
To complete this task, <b><span style="color:blue">you must comment
on ALL 5 images.</span></b>
If you complete the task, you will receive $0.46.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><b>CLOSE WINDOW/TIMEOUT/RETURN HIT</b></h4>
Once the task has started, close window/timeout or return HIT will result in
<b><span style="color:blue">HIT EXPIRED</span></b> to you and NO reward paid.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><b>IMPORTANT NOTICE</b></h4>
<span style="color:blue"><b>1. Be aware the comment you enter will be made public,
so write as you would e.g. on a public social network like Twitter.</b></span>
<br>
2. Please do not reference the task or MTurk itself in the comment. Additionally,
<b>please try not to use the text in the image when forming a comment</b>.
<br>
3. We will reject HITs that do not display any sense that you have looked at the
image while forming the comment. That is, if the comment has nothing to do with the
image, we will not accept it.
<br>
4. Please do not comment anything that involves any level of discrimination,
racism, sexism and offensive religious/politics comments, otherwise the submission
will be rejected.
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you are ready, please click "Accept HIT" to start this task.
