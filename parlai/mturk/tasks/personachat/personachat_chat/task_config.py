(You can keep accepting new HITs after you finish your current one, so keep working on it if you like the task!)

<b>In this task you will chitchat with another worker, playing the part of a given character.</b>
For example, your given character could be: <br><br> I am a vegetarian. I like swimming. My father used to work for Ford. My favorite band is Maroon5. I got a new job last month, which is about advertising design.

Chat with the other person naturally and <b><span style="color:blue">try to get to know each other, i.e.

<b>Send short messages, <span style="color:red">max 15 words</span>.</b>
