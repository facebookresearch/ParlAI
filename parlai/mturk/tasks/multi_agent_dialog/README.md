# Multi-agent Dialog

ParlAI is currently in the process of upgrading MTurk to
[Mephisto](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Mephisto). As part of this
process we have archived a number of older tasks. If you require need to run
this evaluation, you may rewind back to the
[`mturk_archive`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/mturk_archive)
tag:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI.git ~/ParlAI
cd ~/ParlAI
git checkout mturk_archive
```

If you just need to read the code, for reference, you may browse it
[here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/mturk_archive/parlai/mturk/tasks/multi_agent_dialog).
