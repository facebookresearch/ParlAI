`parlai/mturk` contains a few separate MTurk-related folders:

- **core**: contains all the files that are used to make the underlying MTurk interaction work properly
- **tasks**: contains a number of tasks that have been launched on MTurk to collect various datasets (shared for reproducibility), as well as a few tasks that exist as examples of possible MTurk functionality
- **webapp**: contains server and build files for the [Beta] ParlAI-MTurk frontend, which is currently under heavy development and may undergo many changes
