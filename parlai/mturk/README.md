The code in `parlai/mturk/` has been deprecated. All code for running crowdsourcing tasks has been migrated to the [Mephisto](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Mephisto) platform, and code for running Mephisto tasks can be found in [`parlai/crowdsourcing/`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/master/parlai/crowdsourcing).

{{{TODO: how to find each old task}}}
