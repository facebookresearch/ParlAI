## Summary
The webapp is very much still in beta, and a lot of it is subject to change, thus the readme isn't going to be really fleshed out for a while. The code is fairly disorganized as the features come together.

To run the webapp, use `python server.py`.
To run it for sandbox runs, use `python server.py --sandbox`.
Be sure you have node and npm installed.

Eventually this readme will have screenshots demonstrating the functionality, however in the meantime you can look at the various PRs that have directly affected this directory, as each includes images and feature descriptions.
